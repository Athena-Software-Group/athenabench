{"cve_id": "CVE-2025-21688", "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm/v3d: Assign job pointer to NULL before signaling the fence In commit e4b5ccd392b9 (\"drm/v3d: Ensure job pointer is set to NULL after job completion\"), we introduced a change to assign the job pointer to NULL after completing a job, indicating job completion. However, this approach created a race condition between the DRM scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence is signaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed. This results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns a new job to the pointer. This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns it to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an interrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.

{"cve_id": "CVE-2022-49892", "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ftrace: Fix use-after-free for dynamic ftrace_ops KASAN reported a use-after-free with ftrace ops [1]. It was found from vmcore that perf had registered two ops with the same content successively, both dynamic. After unregistering the second ops, a use-after-free occurred. In ftrace_shutdown(), when the second ops is unregistered, the FTRACE_UPDATE_CALLS command is not set because there is another enabled ops with the same content. Also, both ops are dynamic and the ftrace callback function is ftrace_ops_list_func, so the FTRACE_UPDATE_TRACE_FUNC command will not be set. Eventually the value of 'command' will be 0 and ftrace_shutdown() will skip the rcu synchronization. However, ftrace may be activated. When the ops is released, another CPU may be accessing the ops.

{"cve_id": "CVE-2022-49441", "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tty: fix deadlock caused by calling printk() under tty_port->lock pty_write() invokes kmalloc() which may invoke a normal printk() to print failure message. This can cause a deadlock in the scenario reported by syz-bot below: CPU0 CPU1 CPU2 ---- ---- ---- lock(console_owner); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(console_owner); As commit dbdda842fe96 (\"printk: Add console owner and waiter logic to load balance console writes\") said, such deadlock can be prevented by using printk_deferred() in kmalloc() (which is invoked in the section guarded by the port->lock). But there are too many printk() on the kmalloc() path, and kmalloc() can be called from anywhere, so changing printk() to printk_deferred() is too complicated and inelegant.

This can cause a deadlock in the scenario reported by syz-bot below: CPU0 CPU1 CPU2 ---- ---- ---- lock(console_owner); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(console_owner); As commit dbdda842fe96 (\"printk: Add console owner and waiter logic to load balance console writes\") said, such deadlock can be prevented by using printk_deferred() in kmalloc() (which is invoked in the section guarded by the port->lock). But there are too many printk() on the kmalloc() path, and kmalloc() can be called from anywhere, so changing printk() to printk_deferred() is too complicated and inelegant. Therefore, this patch chooses to specify __GFP_NOWARN to kmalloc(), so that printk() will not be called, and this deadlock problem can be avoided.

{"cve_id": "CVE-2022-49327", "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bcache: avoid journal no-space deadlock by reserving 1 journal bucket The journal no-space deadlock was reported time to time. Such deadlock can happen in the following situation. When all journal buckets are fully filled by active jset with heavy write I/O load, the cache set registration (after a reboot) will load all active jsets and inserting them into the btree again (which is called journal replay). If a journaled bkey is inserted into a btree node and results btree node split, new journal request might be triggered. For example, the btree grows one more level after the node split, then the root node record in cache device super block will be upgrade by bch_journal_meta() from bch_btree_set_root(). But there is no space in journal buckets, the journal replay has to wait for new journal bucket to be reclaimed after at least one journal bucket replayed. This is one example that how the journal no-space deadlock happens. The solution to avoid the deadlock is to reserve 1 journal bucket in run time, and only permit the reserved journal bucket to be used during cache set registration procedure for things like journal replay. Then the journal space will never be fully filled, there is no chance for journal no-space deadlock to happen anymore. This patch adds a new member \"bool do_reserve\" in struct journal, it is inititalized to 0 (false) when struct journal is allocated, and set to 1 (true) by bch_journal_space_reserve() when all initialization done in run_cache_set(). In the run time when journal_reclaim() tries to allocate a new journal bucket, free_journal_buckets() is called to check whether there are enough free journal buckets to use. If there is only 1 free journal bucket and journal->do_reserve is 1 (true), the last bucket is reserved and free_journal_buckets() will return 0 to indicate no free journal bucket. Then journal_reclaim() will give up, and try next time to see whetheer there is free journal bucket to allocate. By this method, there is always 1 jouranl bucket reserved in run time. During the cache set registration, journal->do_reserve is 0 (false), so the reserved journal bucket can be used to avoid the no-space deadlock.", "prompt": "Analyze the following CVE description and calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score.

Such deadlock can happen in the following situation. When all journal buckets are fully filled by active jset with heavy write I/O load, the cache set registration (after a reboot) will load all active jsets and inserting them into the btree again (which is called journal replay). If a journaled bkey is inserted into a btree node and results btree node split, new journal request might be triggered. For example, the btree grows one more level after the node split, then the root node record in cache device super block will be upgrade by bch_journal_meta() from bch_btree_set_root(). But there is no space in journal buckets, the journal replay has to wait for new journal bucket to be reclaimed after at least one journal bucket replayed. This is one example that how the journal no-space deadlock happens. The solution to avoid the deadlock is to reserve 1 journal bucket in run time, and only permit the reserved journal bucket to be used during cache set registration procedure for things like journal replay. Then the journal space will never be fully filled, there is no chance for journal no-space deadlock to happen anymore. This patch adds a new member \"bool do_reserve\" in struct journal, it is inititalized to 0 (false) when struct journal is allocated, and set to 1 (true) by bch_journal_space_reserve() when all initialization done in run_cache_set(). In the run time when journal_reclaim() tries to allocate a new journal bucket, free_journal_buckets() is called to check whether there are enough free journal buckets to use. If there is only 1 free journal bucket and journal->do_reserve is 1 (true), the last bucket is reserved and free_journal_buckets() will return 0 to indicate no free journal bucket. Then journal_reclaim() will give up, and try next time to see whetheer there is free journal bucket to allocate. By this method, there is always 1 jouranl bucket reserved in run time. During the cache set registration, journal->do_reserve is 0 (false), so the reserved journal bucket can be used to avoid the no-space deadlock.\n", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "vector_score": 5.5, "severity": "MEDIUM", "prompt_hash": "950ba7a21e8827cd2bd59d599b5f504c8e399a6a1fb873a887a9041dac91986d"}
