A memory leak vulnerability was identified in the `crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability can lead to resource exhaustion and degraded system performance over time, particularly in long-running processes or systems processing large volumes of data. The vulnerability is present in the `crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter` function within `crypto_tc.c`. The function allocates memory using `malloc` without ensuring the allocated memory is always freed. This issue can lead to resource exhaustion, reduced system performance, and potentially a Denial of Service (DoS) in environments where CryptoLib is used in long-running processes or with large volumes of data. Any system using CryptoLib, especially those handling high-throughput or continuous data streams, could be impacted. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.\n", "response": "The vulnerability is a memory leak, specifically described as a function allocating memory with `malloc` but failing to free it.

The `g-recaptcha-response` is a token issued by reCAPTCHA that requires server-side verification using a secret key to confirm its authenticity and integrity. A \"key management error\" in this context, especially when triggered by the manipulation of such a token, strongly indicates a failure in the system's ability to properly use its secret key to verify the cryptographic signature or integrity of the reCAPTCHA response. This allows a manipulated response to be accepted, bypassing the intended security control.

A vulnerability in versions from 5.0 to 16.7.1 affects users with Message Stream enabled and a wiki configured as closed from selecting \"Prevent unregistered users to view pages\" in the Administrations Rights. The vulnerability is that any message sent in a subwiki to \"everyone\" is actually sent to the farm: any visitor of the main wiki will be able to see that message through the Dashboard, even if the subwiki is configured to be private. This issue will not be patched as Message Stream has been deprecated in XWiki 16.8.0RC1 and is not maintained anymore. A workaround for this issue involves keeping Message Stream disabled by default. It's advised to keep it disabled from Administration > Social > Message Stream.\n", "response": "The vulnerability arises because the XWiki Platform, despite having explicit access control configurations (e.g., subwiki configured as private, \"Prevent unregistered users to view pages\" selected), fails to correctly enforce these authorization rules when messages are broadcast via the Message Stream. Messages intended for a restricted audience within a private subwiki are incorrectly exposed to unauthorized visitors of the main wiki. This indicates that the authorization logic for the Message Stream component does not correctly determine whether an actor is authorized to view the message, bypassing the intended privacy settings.\n\nAnswer: CWE-863", "prediction": "CWE-863", "answer": "CWE-668", "score": 0, "success": true}

Multiple evaluation of a single expression is possible in the iterator target of a for loop. While the iterator expression cannot produce multiple writes, it can consume side effects produced in the loop body (e.g. read a storage variable updated in the loop body) and thus lead to unexpected program behavior. Specifically, reads in iterators which contain an ifexp (e.g. `for s: uint256 in ([read(), read()] if True else [])`) may interleave reads with writes in the loop body. Vyper for loops allow two kinds of iterator targets, namely the `range()` builtin and an iterable type, like SArray and DArray. During codegen, iterable lists are required to not produce any side-effects (in the following code, `range_scope` forces `iter_list` to be parsed in a constant context, which is checked against `is_constant`). However, this does not prevent the iterator from consuming side effects provided by the body of the loop. For SArrays on the other hand, `iter_list` is instantiated in the body of a `repeat` ir, so it can be evaluated several times. This issue is being addressed and is expected to be available in version 0.4.1. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as the patched release is available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "response": "The vulnerability stems from the Vyper compiler's handling of `for` loop iterators, specifically when an iterator expression is unexpectedly re-evaluated multiple times within the loop's execution. This re-evaluation allows the iterator to consume side effects (e.g., read updated storage variables) produced by the loop body, leading to an unintended interleaving of reads and writes and ultimately, unexpected program behavior. This is a direct failure in managing the sequence and frequency of expression evaluations, which are fundamental aspects of program control flow.\n\nAnswer: CWE-664", "prediction": "CWE-664", "answer": "CWE-662", "score": 0, "success": true}

This is due to a misconfiguration of excluded roles during registration. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register with an Administrator role if a custom login form is being used. This can be combined with CVE-2025-2797 to bypass the user approval process if an Administrator can be tricked into taking an action such as clicking a link.\n", "response": "The vulnerability is described as an \"Authentication Bypass\" due to a \"misconfiguration of excluded roles during registration,\" which allows unauthenticated attackers to register with an Administrator role. The root cause lies in the system's failure to properly manage and assign privileges (roles) during the user registration process. Specifically, the misconfiguration allows for the improper assignment of the highly privileged Administrator role to a newly registered, unauthorized user. This directly aligns with the definition of improper privilege management.\n\nAnswer: CWE-269", "prediction": "CWE-269", "answer": "CWE-269", "score": 1, "success": true}

The plugin’s registration handler reads the client-supplied $_POST['user_role'] and passes it directly to wp_insert_user() without restricting to a safe set of roles. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator.\n", "response": "The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to implement an authorization check on the `user_role` parameter provided by the client during registration.

(b) use syscall(__NR_sendmsg, ...) to create bond link device and vxcan link device, and bind vxcan device to bond device (can also use ifenslave command to bind vxcan device to bond device). (c) use syscall(__NR_socket, 0x1dul, 3ul, 1) to create CAN socket. (d) use syscall(__NR_bind, ...) to bind the bond device to CAN socket. The bond device invokes the can-raw protocol registration interface to receive CAN packets. However, ml_priv is not allocated to the dev, dev_rcv_lists is assigned to NULL in can_rx_register(). In this case, it will occur the NULL pointer dereference issue.
