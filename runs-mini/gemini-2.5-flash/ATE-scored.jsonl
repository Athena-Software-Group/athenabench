They developed a custom exploit that reliably triggers the bug to gain code execution and validated it in a lab before deploying it against the target’s environment.\n", "response": "The adversary performed vulnerability research through patch diffing to identify a flaw and subsequently developed a custom exploit to leverage it. This process of creating an exploit based on identified vulnerabilities directly aligns with the \"Develop Capabilities\" technique.\n\nAnswer: T1587", "prediction": "T1587", "answer": "T1587.004", "score": 1, "success": true}
