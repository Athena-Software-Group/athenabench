Prior to version 25.4.0, the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently, conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization, which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result, the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions, conda-build creates a potential execution pathway for malicious code, violating security assumptions. This issue has been patched in version 25.4.0.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we need to determine the values for each base metric based on the given CVE description.\n\n1.

Therefore, the attack complexity is considered low.\n\n- Privileges Required (PR): None (N) - The vulnerability can be triggered by a regular user without any special privileges. The steps to reproduce the issue do not require root access or any elevated privileges.\n\n- User Interaction (UI): None (N) - The vulnerability can be triggered without any user interaction. The steps to reproduce the issue are automated and do not require any user input.\n\n- Scope (S): Unchanged (U) - The vulnerability affects the Linux kernel, which is a core component of the operating system. The scope of the vulnerability is unchanged, as it does not affect any other components or systems beyond the kernel.\n\n- Confidentiality (C): Low (L) - The vulnerability could potentially lead to a NULL pointer dereference, which might cause a denial of service or other issues. However, there is no indication that sensitive data could be leaked or modified.

However, this approach created a race condition between the DRM scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence is signaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed. This results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns a new job to the pointer. This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns it to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an interrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.

It triggers a NULL pointer dereference in the periodic tick code. This happens because the legacy timer interrupt (IRQ0) is resent in software which happens in soft interrupt (tasklet) context. In this context get_irq_regs() returns NULL which leads to the NULL pointer dereference. The reason for the resend is a spurious APIC interrupt on the IRQ0 vector which is captured and leads to a resend when the legacy timer interrupt is enabled. This is wrong because the legacy PIC interrupts are level triggered and therefore should never be resent in software, but nothing ever sets the IRQ_LEVEL flag on those interrupts, so the core code does not know about their trigger type. Ensure that IRQ_LEVEL is set when the legacy PCI interrupts are set up.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we need to determine the values for each base metric based on the given CVE description.

It was found from vmcore that perf had registered two ops with the same content successively, both dynamic. After unregistering the second ops, a use-after-free occurred. In ftrace_shutdown(), when the second ops is unregistered, the FTRACE_UPDATE_CALLS command is not set because there is another enabled ops with the same content. Also, both ops are dynamic and the ftrace callback function is ftrace_ops_list_func, so the FTRACE_UPDATE_TRACE_FUNC command will not be set. Eventually the value of 'command' will be 0 and ftrace_shutdown() will skip the rcu synchronization. However, ftrace may be activated. When the ops is released, another CPU may be accessing the ops. Add the missing synchronization to fix this problem.

The logic is applicable to architectures where the CLOSID effectively forms part of the monitoring identifier and so do not allow complete freedom to choose an unused monitoring identifier for a given CLOSID. This support missed that some platforms may not have these counters. This causes a NULL pointer dereference when creating a new control group as the array was not allocated by dom_data_init().

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `editar_permissoes.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `msg_c` parameter. The application fails to validate and sanitize user inputs in the `msg_c` parameter. This lack of validation permits the injection of malicious payloads, which are reflected back to the user's browser in the server's response and executed within the context of the victim's browser. This issue has been addressed in release version 3.2.6. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we need to determine the values for each base metric based on the provided CVE description.\n\n1.

This can cause a deadlock in the scenario reported by syz-bot below: CPU0 CPU1 CPU2 ---- ---- ---- lock(console_owner); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(console_owner); As commit dbdda842fe96 (\"printk: Add console owner and waiter logic to load balance console writes\") said, such deadlock can be prevented by using printk_deferred() in kmalloc() (which is invoked in the section guarded by the port->lock). But there are too many printk() on the kmalloc() path, and kmalloc() can be called from anywhere, so changing printk() to printk_deferred() is too complicated and inelegant. Therefore, this patch chooses to specify __GFP_NOWARN to kmalloc(), so that printk() will not be called, and this deadlock problem can be avoided.

When all journal buckets are fully filled by active jset with heavy write I/O load, the cache set registration (after a reboot) will load all active jsets and inserting them into the btree again (which is called journal replay). If a journaled bkey is inserted into a btree node and results btree node split, new journal request might be triggered. For example, the btree grows one more level after the node split, then the root node record in cache device super block will be upgrade by bch_journal_meta() from bch_btree_set_root(). But there is no space in journal buckets, the journal replay has to wait for new journal bucket to be reclaimed after at least one journal bucket replayed. This is one example that how the journal no-space deadlock happens. The solution to avoid the deadlock is to reserve 1 journal bucket in run time, and only permit the reserved journal bucket to be used during cache set registration procedure for things like journal replay. Then the journal space will never be fully filled, there is no chance for journal no-space deadlock to happen anymore. This patch adds a new member \"bool do_reserve\" in struct journal, it is inititalized to 0 (false) when struct journal is allocated, and set to 1 (true) by bch_journal_space_reserve() when all initialization done in run_cache_set(). In the run time when journal_reclaim() tries to allocate a new journal bucket, free_journal_buckets() is called to check whether there are enough free journal buckets to use. If there is only 1 free journal bucket and journal->do_reserve is 1 (true), the last bucket is reserved and free_journal_buckets() will return 0 to indicate no free journal bucket. Then journal_reclaim() will give up, and try next time to see whetheer there is free journal bucket to allocate. By this method, there is always 1 jouranl bucket reserved in run time. During the cache set registration, journal->do_reserve is 0 (false), so the reserved journal bucket can be used to avoid the no-space deadlock.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we need to determine the values for each base metric based on the given CVE description.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request).\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we need to determine the values for each base metric based on the given CVE description.\n\n1.

This lingering reference comes from a secpath (which holds a ref on the xfrm_state), which is still attached to an skb. This skb is not leaked, it ends up on sk_receive_queue and then gets defer-free'd by skb_attempt_defer_free. The problem happens when we defer freeing an skb (push it on one CPU's defer_list), and don't flush that list before the netns is deleted. In that case, we still have a reference on the xfrm_state that we don't expect at this point. We already drop the skb's dst in the TCP receive path when it's no longer needed, so let's also drop the secpath. At this point, tcp_filter has already called into the LSM hooks that may require the secpath, so it should not be needed anymore.

In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it is possible for any authenticated user, through the use of the filemanager to delete any file owned by the user running the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) on the host without any limitation on the filesystem's scope. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to arbitrarily remove content from the Wiki resulting in partial loss of data and defacement/deterioration of the website. In the context of a container installation of YesWiki without any modification, the `yeswiki` files (for example .php) are not owned by the same user (root) as the one running the FPM process (www-data). However in a standard installation, www-data may also be the owner of the PHP files, allowing a malicious user to completely cut the access to the wiki by deleting all important PHP files (like index.php or core files of YesWiki). Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for this issue.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we need to determine the values for each base metric based on the given CVE description.\n\n1.

A SQL Injection vulnerability was identified in versions prior to 3.4.6 in the endpoint `/html/atendido/Profile_Atendido.php`, in the `idatendido` parameter. This vulnerability allow an authorized attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing access to sensitive information. Version 3.4.6 fixes the issue.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we need to determine the values for each base metric based on the given CVE description. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. Attack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in a web application, and the attack is executed through a web interface. Since the attack is delivered over a network, the chosen value is AV:N (Network).\n\n2. Attack Complexity (AC): The description does not specify any additional requirements for the attack beyond the vulnerability itself. Therefore, the chosen value is AC:L (Low).\n\n3. Privileges Required (PR): The vulnerability allows an authorized attacker to exploit it. This means the attacker already has some level of access or privilege, but not necessarily the highest level. The chosen value is PR:L (Low).\n\n4. User Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is in a web application and can be exploited without any user interaction. The chosen value is UI:N (None).\n\n5. Scope (S): The description does not specify that the scope of the vulnerability is changed. Therefore, the chosen value is S:U (Unchanged).\n\n6. Confidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows access to sensitive information, which implies a high impact on confidentiality. The chosen value is C:H (High).\n\n7. Integrity (I): The description does not specify any impact on data integrity. Therefore, the chosen value is I:N (None).\n\n8. Availability (A): The description does not specify any impact on system availability. Therefore, the chosen value is A:N (None).\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 2.3000000000000007, "success": true}
