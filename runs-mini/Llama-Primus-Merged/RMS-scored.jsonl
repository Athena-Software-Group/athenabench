Restricting file and directory permissions can prevent unauthorized execution of scripts and payloads.\n- M1042: Restrict Registry Permissions: PowerShell scripts often interact with the Windows registry. Restricting registry permissions can limit the attacker's ability to modify or access sensitive registry keys.\n- M1043: Restrict PowerShell Script Block Logging: The attacker used PowerShell to execute a script. Enabling PowerShell script block logging can help detect and alert on unauthorized script execution.\n- M1044: Restrict PowerShell Execution: This mitigation is directly related to the use of PowerShell by the attacker. Restricting PowerShell execution can prevent the use of PowerShell for malicious activities.\n- M1045: Restrict Registry Permissions: Similar to M1042, restricting registry permissions can prevent the attacker from modifying or accessing sensitive registry keys, which could be used to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.\n- M1046: Restrict PowerShell Script Block Logging: This is a duplicate of M1043, but included for emphasis on the importance of logging PowerShell script block execution.\n- M1047: Restrict PowerShell Execution: Another duplicate of M1044, included for emphasis on the importance of restricting PowerShell execution.\n- M1048: Restrict PowerShell Script Block Logging: This is a duplicate of M1043, included for emphasis on the importance of logging PowerShell script block execution.\n\nAnswer: M1037, M1041, M1042, M1043, M1044, M1045, M1046, M1047, M1048", "prediction": "M1037, M1041, M1042, M1043, M1044, M1045, M1046, M1047, M1048", "answer": "M1021, M1026, M1033, M1038, M1040, M1042, M1045, M1047, M1049", "score": 0.3333333333333333, "success": true}

They set the service to run under the LocalSystem account, ensuring the malicious payload executed with SYSTEM privileges on every restart.\n", "response": "To address the given attack scenario, the following MITRE ATT&CK mitigations are recommended:\n\nM1037 - Restrict File and Directory Permissions to Known Clean Versions\nM1041 - Restrict Registry Permissions\nM1042 - Restrict Registry Permissions\nM1043 - Restrict Registry Permissions\nM1044 - Restrict Registry Permissions\nM1045 - Restrict Registry Permissions\nM1046 - Restrict Registry Permissions\nM1047 - Restrict Registry Permissions\nM1048 - Restrict Registry Permissions\n\nThese mitigations are chosen to address the scenario by focusing on restricting permissions to prevent unauthorized access and modifications to the registry and file system, which are critical components in the attack. Restricting permissions ensures that only authorized users and processes can access and modify these areas, thereby preventing the installation of malicious services and payloads.", "prediction": "", "answer": "M1018, M1022, M1026, M1028, M1033, M1040, M1045, M1047, M1054", "score": 0.0, "success": true}
