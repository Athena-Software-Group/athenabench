Prior to version 25.4.0, the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently, conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization, which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result, the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions, conda-build creates a potential execution pathway for malicious code, violating security assumptions. This issue has been patched in version 25.4.0.\n", "response": "- Attack Vector (AV): Local (L) — Exploitation requires processing a malicious meta.yaml locally via conda-build (malicious file scenario), not direct network exploitation.\n- Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L) — No special conditions; simply embedding malicious selectors triggers code execution.\n- Privileges Required (PR): None (N) — Attacker needs no prior access to the victim system; only the crafted recipe is needed.\n- User Interaction (UI): Required (R) — A victim must run conda-build on the malicious recipe to trigger the vulnerability.\n- Scope (S): Unchanged (U) — Code executes with the privileges of the conda-build process; no cross-authorization boundary is crossed.\n- Confidentiality (C): High (H) — Arbitrary code execution can read sensitive files/data in the build environment.\n- Integrity (I): High (H) — Allows unauthorized commands and file modifications, compromising build integrity.\n- Availability (A): High (H) — Arbitrary code can disrupt or halt the build process and system resources.\n\nCVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8 (High)\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 2.000000000000001, "success": true}

However, this approach created a race condition between the DRM scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence is signaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed. This results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns a new job to the pointer. This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns it to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an interrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.

It triggers a NULL pointer dereference in the periodic tick code. This happens because the legacy timer interrupt (IRQ0) is resent in software which happens in soft interrupt (tasklet) context. In this context get_irq_regs() returns NULL which leads to the NULL pointer dereference. The reason for the resend is a spurious APIC interrupt on the IRQ0 vector which is captured and leads to a resend when the legacy timer interrupt is enabled. This is wrong because the legacy PIC interrupts are level triggered and therefore should never be resent in software, but nothing ever sets the IRQ_LEVEL flag on those interrupts, so the core code does not know about their trigger type. Ensure that IRQ_LEVEL is set when the legacy PCI interrupts are set up.\n", "response": "CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 4.1 (Medium)\n\n- AV (Attack Vector): Local (L) — The issue manifests on the local system during crash-kernel boot; not remotely triggerable.\n- AC (Attack Complexity): High (H) — Requires specific timing/conditions (spurious APIC interrupt) and crash-kernel context, making exploitation non-trivial.\n- PR (Privileges Required): High (H) — Practically requires administrative ability to induce a kernel crash or configure/use crashkernel/kdump.\n- UI (User Interaction): None (N) — No end-user interaction is needed once conditions exist.\n- S (Scope): Unchanged (U) — The impact remains within the same security scope (the kernel), no cross-boundary effects.\n- C (Confidentiality): None (N) — No data exposure.\n- I (Integrity): None (N) — No data modification.\n- A (Availability): High (H) — Leads to kernel NULL pointer dereference and crash of the crash-kernel (DoS).\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.4000000000000004, "success": true}

It was found from vmcore that perf had registered two ops with the same content successively, both dynamic. After unregistering the second ops, a use-after-free occurred. In ftrace_shutdown(), when the second ops is unregistered, the FTRACE_UPDATE_CALLS command is not set because there is another enabled ops with the same content. Also, both ops are dynamic and the ftrace callback function is ftrace_ops_list_func, so the FTRACE_UPDATE_TRACE_FUNC command will not be set. Eventually the value of 'command' will be 0 and ftrace_shutdown() will skip the rcu synchronization. However, ftrace may be activated. When the ops is released, another CPU may be accessing the ops.

This can cause a deadlock in the scenario reported by syz-bot below: CPU0 CPU1 CPU2 ---- ---- ---- lock(console_owner); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(console_owner); As commit dbdda842fe96 (\"printk: Add console owner and waiter logic to load balance console writes\") said, such deadlock can be prevented by using printk_deferred() in kmalloc() (which is invoked in the section guarded by the port->lock). But there are too many printk() on the kmalloc() path, and kmalloc() can be called from anywhere, so changing printk() to printk_deferred() is too complicated and inelegant. Therefore, this patch chooses to specify __GFP_NOWARN to kmalloc(), so that printk() will not be called, and this deadlock problem can be avoided.

Such deadlock can happen in the following situation. When all journal buckets are fully filled by active jset with heavy write I/O load, the cache set registration (after a reboot) will load all active jsets and inserting them into the btree again (which is called journal replay). If a journaled bkey is inserted into a btree node and results btree node split, new journal request might be triggered. For example, the btree grows one more level after the node split, then the root node record in cache device super block will be upgrade by bch_journal_meta() from bch_btree_set_root(). But there is no space in journal buckets, the journal replay has to wait for new journal bucket to be reclaimed after at least one journal bucket replayed. This is one example that how the journal no-space deadlock happens. The solution to avoid the deadlock is to reserve 1 journal bucket in run time, and only permit the reserved journal bucket to be used during cache set registration procedure for things like journal replay. Then the journal space will never be fully filled, there is no chance for journal no-space deadlock to happen anymore. This patch adds a new member \"bool do_reserve\" in struct journal, it is inititalized to 0 (false) when struct journal is allocated, and set to 1 (true) by bch_journal_space_reserve() when all initialization done in run_cache_set(). In the run time when journal_reclaim() tries to allocate a new journal bucket, free_journal_buckets() is called to check whether there are enough free journal buckets to use. If there is only 1 free journal bucket and journal->do_reserve is 1 (true), the last bucket is reserved and free_journal_buckets() will return 0 to indicate no free journal bucket. Then journal_reclaim() will give up, and try next time to see whetheer there is free journal bucket to allocate. By this method, there is always 1 jouranl bucket reserved in run time. During the cache set registration, journal->do_reserve is 0 (false), so the reserved journal bucket can be used to avoid the no-space deadlock.\n", "response": "Here is the CVSS v3.1 Base Score analysis based on the description.\n\n- AV (Attack Vector): Local (L)\n  - Justification: The issue is triggered through local I/O activity to a bcache-backed device; it is not remotely exploitable.\n\n- AC (Attack Complexity): Low (L)\n  - Justification: An attacker can fill journal buckets via heavy write I/O and the deadlock manifests deterministically during journal replay on reboot; no special timing or uncommon conditions beyond achievable system state.\n\n- PR (Privileges Required): None (N)\n  - Justification: No elevated privileges over the vulnerable component are required; normal local user I/O activity suffices.\n\n- UI (User Interaction): None (N)\n  - Justification: No user interaction is needed to trigger the condition beyond the system’s normal reboot sequence; the exploitation does not rely on a victim action.\n\n- S (Scope): Unchanged (U)\n  - Justification: The impact remains within the same security boundary (kernel/bcache), without affecting other components’ authorization scope.\n\n- C (Confidentiality): None (N)\n  - Justification: No disclosure of information is indicated.\n\n- I (Integrity): None (N)\n  - Justification: No data modification is indicated.\n\n- A (Availability): High (H)\n  - Justification: The deadlock can hang journal replay/cache set registration, potentially leading to system or storage unavailability.\n\nBase Score (calculated): 6.2 (Medium)\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.7000000000000002, "success": true}

A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request).\n", "response": "- AV: Network (N) — Exploited via HTTP requests over the network.\n- AC: High (H) — Requires attacker control of content on the target site or a subdomain (e.g., XSS or subdomain takeover), a significant precondition.\n- PR: None (N) — No privileges on the vulnerable application are needed.\n- UI: Required (R) — Victim must visit attacker-controlled content and be authenticated.\n- S: Unchanged (U) — Impact is confined to the same web application; no security authority change.\n- C: None (N) — Does not directly expose sensitive data; the issue enables request forgery, not data read-out.\n- I: High (H) — Attacker can perform arbitrary state-changing requests on the user's behalf.\n- A: None (N) — No direct impact on availability is described.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 0.7999999999999998, "success": true}

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `informacao_adicional.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `descricao` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `informacao_adicional.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed, the malicious payload is executed in the victim's browser, potentially compromising the user's data and system.
