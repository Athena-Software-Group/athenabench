Since commit 8979b02aaf1d (\"tpm: Fix reference count to main device\") the extra reference used to prevent a premature zero counter is never taken, because the required TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 flag is never set. Fix this by moving the TPM 2 character device handling from tpm_chip_alloc() to tpm_add_char_device() which is called at a later point in time when the flag has been set in case of TPM2. Commit fdc915f7f719 (\"tpm: expose spaces via a device link /dev/tpmrm<n>\") already introduced function tpm_devs_release() to release the extra reference but did not implement the required put on chip->devs that results in the call of this function.

Finally move the new implementation for the TPM 2 handling into a new function to avoid multiple checks for the TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 flag in the good case and error cases.\n", "response": "The issue stems from incorrect reference counting of the TPM device object, leading to operations (kobject_get/tpm_try_get_ops) on an object whose reference count has already dropped to zero.

Multiple evaluation of a single expression is possible in the iterator target of a for loop. While the iterator expression cannot produce multiple writes, it can consume side effects produced in the loop body (e.g. read a storage variable updated in the loop body) and thus lead to unexpected program behavior. Specifically, reads in iterators which contain an ifexp (e.g. `for s: uint256 in ([read(), read()] if True else [])`) may interleave reads with writes in the loop body. Vyper for loops allow two kinds of iterator targets, namely the `range()` builtin and an iterable type, like SArray and DArray. During codegen, iterable lists are required to not produce any side-effects (in the following code, `range_scope` forces `iter_list` to be parsed in a constant context, which is checked against `is_constant`). However, this does not prevent the iterator from consuming side effects provided by the body of the loop. For SArrays on the other hand, `iter_list` is instantiated in the body of a `repeat` ir, so it can be evaluated several times. This issue is being addressed and is expected to be available in version 0.4.1. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as the patched release is available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "response": "CWE-696 fits because the vulnerability stems from an incorrect order/sequence of operations during code generation: the iterator expression is (re)evaluated in a way that interleaves its reads with writes performed in the loop body, causing unexpected behavior due to side-effect consumption and multiple evaluations.\n\nAnswer: CWE-696", "prediction": "CWE-696", "answer": "CWE-662", "score": 0, "success": true}

This maps directly to improper neutralization of input during web page generation.\n\nAnswer: CWE-79", "prediction": "CWE-79", "answer": "CWE-79", "score": 1, "success": true}

An authenticated user can upload and force the execution of *.php files located on the GLPI server. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.0.18.\n", "response": "The issue stems from allowing authenticated users to upload files that can be executed by the server (e.g., .php), indicating insufficient validation and restriction on uploaded file types. This is a classic case of an unrestricted upload of files with dangerous types, enabling remote code execution when the uploaded script is accessed or triggered.\n\nAnswer: CWE-434", "prediction": "CWE-434", "answer": "CWE-434", "score": 1, "success": true}

This is in violation of the WebAuthN spec which requires \"a secure transport established without errors\". This vulnerability affects Firefox < 140 and Thunderbird < 140.\n", "response": "CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) best captures the root cause. WebAuthn operations must only occur over an error-free, authenticated TLS channel. By permitting WebAuthn after a user-added certificate exception (i.e., a connection with certificate errors), the product failed to enforce proper certificate validation for this security-sensitive operation, enabling potential MITM.\n\nAnswer: CWE-295", "prediction": "CWE-295", "answer": "CWE-295", "score": 1, "success": true}
