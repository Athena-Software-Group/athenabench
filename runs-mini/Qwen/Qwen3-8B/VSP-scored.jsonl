This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a Stored XSS vulnerability in the IndieBlocks plugin for WordPress. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, let's recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The ones mentioned are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the 'kind' parameter, which is a request parameter. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated (Contributor-level access), they can't just send a request from the network. They have to be logged in. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the system. Wait, but sometimes if the parameter is in a request, maybe it's network? Wait, no. The description says \"authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above\" can exploit this. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker has to be authenticated and have access to the system. So AV is Local (L).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires the attacker to have Contributor access, but the description says \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.\" So the attack doesn't require any special setup beyond the user being authenticated. So the complexity is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to perform any additional steps beyond the initial access.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be authenticated with Contributor-level access. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some level of access, but not full administrative privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated (Contributor-level), that's a low privilege requirement. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says the attacker can inject scripts that execute when a user accesses the page. So the user has to visit the injected page. But the attacker doesn't need any interaction beyond the initial injection. Wait, the user interaction is required for the script to execute. Wait, the user has to access the page, but the attacker doesn't need to interact with the user. The user is the one accessing the page. So UI is None (N) because the attack doesn't require any user interaction beyond the initial injection. Wait, but the user has to click on the malicious link. Wait, no. The user is the one who is accessing the page, but the attacker injects the script into the page. So the user interaction is required for the script to execute. Wait, the user has to visit the page. But the attacker doesn't need to interact with the user. So the UI is None (N) because the user is just accessing the page, but the attacker doesn't need to interact with the user. Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me think again. The user interaction metric is whether the user has to take some action, like clicking a link. If the script is injected into a page that the user accesses, then the user has to visit that page. But the attacker doesn't need to interact with the user. So UI is None (N) because the user is just accessing the page, but the attacker doesn't need to interact with the user. So UI is N.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges. Since the vulnerability is a Stored XSS, the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attacker can't elevate privileges beyond their current level. So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject arbitrary scripts, which can steal user data. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can read sensitive information.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject scripts, which can modify the page content. So integrity is High (H) because the attacker can alter the data.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't directly affect availability. The attacker can't cause denial of service. So availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: Low (L)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: High (H)\nI: High (H)\nA: None (N)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the attack vector is Local or Network. The attacker is authenticated, so they can send requests to the server. But the parameter is in the request, so maybe the attack vector is Network (N)? Wait, no. Because the attacker has to be authenticated. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the system. For example, if the vulnerability is in a parameter that's accessible via a request, but the attacker needs to be logged in, then AV is Local. If the attacker can exploit it from the network without being authenticated, then AV is Network. But in this case, the attacker must be authenticated. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAnother point: the user interaction. If the user has to click on a link to trigger the script, then UI is Required (R). But the description says the attacker injects the script into pages that execute when a user accesses them. So the user has to access the page, but the attacker doesn't need to interact with the user. So UI is None (N) because the user is just accessing the page, but the attacker doesn't need to interact with the user. So UI is N.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 1.6999999999999993, "success": true}

This issue affects Change Add to Cart Button Text for WooCommerce: from n/a through 2.2.2.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The CVE is about a stored XSS vulnerability in a WordPress plugin. First, I need to figure out each of the base metrics.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). Since it's a stored XSS, the attacker would need to inject code into the web page, which is then stored and executed when another user visits. That's typically a network attack because the attacker can send the malicious payload through the web interface, which is then stored on the server. So AV should be Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps. Just injecting the script into the input field would be sufficient. No special tools or steps required, so AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior access. They can exploit this from the public web, so no user credentials are needed.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is Required (R) because the user has to visit the page where the stored XSS is present. The attacker can't execute the script without the user interacting with the page. So UI is Required.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to elevate privileges beyond the initial attack. The scope remains within the same component, so S is Unchanged.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is High (H) because the XSS can steal user data, cookies, or session information. The attacker can access sensitive information from the user's browser.\n\nIntegrity (I) is High (H) because the attacker can modify the content of the web page, potentially altering data or redirecting users. They can inject malicious scripts that change the page's content.\n\nAvailability (A) is None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't directly impact the availability of the service. The attack is more about data theft or modification rather than causing a denial of service.\n\nPutting it all together, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but I need to check if UI is Required. Since the user has to click on the malicious content, that's required. So UI:R is correct. But sometimes, for stored XSS, the user interaction might be considered as not required if the script is stored and executed automatically. Hmm, maybe I should double-check. If the attacker stores the script, and then any user visiting the page gets infected, the user interaction is required for the attack to take effect. So UI:R is correct.

This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `id` parameter. Version 3.4.5 fixes the issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a Reflected XSS vulnerability in WeGIA. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the `id` parameter, which is a reflected XSS. Reflected XSS typically requires the user to click on a malicious link, so the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can send the malicious script via a link or URL, and the user has to click on it. Wait, but sometimes reflected XSS can be considered as Local (L) if it's through a form submission. But in this case, since it's a parameter in the URL, it's more likely Network. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). For XSS, the complexity is usually Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps. The user just needs to have the malicious script in the URL, so the complexity is low. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). Since it's a reflected XSS, the attacker doesn't need any prior privileges. The user just needs to be tricked into clicking the link. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). Reflected XSS requires the user to interact, like clicking a link, so UI:R. Wait, but the description says the attacker injects the script into the id parameter. If the user is tricked into visiting a malicious link, then UI is Required (R). But sometimes, if the script is delivered via a different vector, maybe UI is not required. Wait, the user has to be tricked into clicking the link, so UI is required. So UI:R.\n\nScope (S). The scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't change the scope. The attack affects the same security scope as the original component. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). Reflected XSS can steal user data, so confidentiality is High (H). The attacker can read cookies or other data. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can modify data on the user's browser, but since it's reflected, maybe the integrity is not directly affected. Wait, but if the attacker can inject scripts, they might modify the page's content, which affects integrity. However, in reflected XSS, the attacker can't modify the server's data, just the client's browser. So maybe I:N? Wait, the CVSS defines Integrity as the ability to modify data. If the attacker can inject scripts, they can alter the page's content, which is part of the user's session. So maybe I:H? Or is it considered that the attacker can't modify the server's data, so I:N? Hmm. I need to check. For XSS, the integrity is usually High because the attacker can alter the content the user sees. But the CVSS might consider that the attacker can't modify the server's data, so maybe I:N. Wait, the CVSS v3.1 defines Integrity as the ability to modify the information that a component can access. So if the attacker can inject scripts, they can alter the page's content, which is part of the user's session. So I:H. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The vulnerability is reflected XSS, so the attacker can inject scripts into the response, which can alter the page's content. So the integrity of the user's session is compromised. Therefore, I:H.\n\nAvailability (A). Reflected XSS doesn't directly affect availability. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the user interaction is required. So UI:R. But some sources might say that for XSS, UI is not required. Wait, the user has to be tricked into clicking the link, so UI is required. So UI:R. But I need to confirm. According to CVSS, User Interaction (UI) is Required (R) if the user must take some action, like clicking a link. So yes, UI:R.\n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but the answer example in the prompt has UI:N. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The user interaction for XSS. If the attack is reflected, the user has to be tricked into clicking a link, which requires user interaction. So UI:R. But some sources might say that for XSS, UI is not required. Wait, the CVSS defines UI as Required if the user must take some action. So in this case, the user has to click the link, so UI:R. But maybe the answer expects UI:N. Wait, the example given in the prompt's final line is Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. But that's for a different scenario. Wait, the example is just an example. Let me think again. For a reflected XSS, the user interaction is required. So UI:R. But maybe the answer is different. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. According to the CVSS v3.1 documentation, for XSS, the User Interaction is Required (R) because the user must be tricked into clicking a malicious link. So UI:R. Therefore, the vector would have UI:R. But I need to make sure. Let me check the example again. The example given in the prompt's final line is Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. That's for a different scenario, maybe a different type of vulnerability. So in this case, the correct UI is R. So the final vector would be AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. But I'm not sure about the integrity. Let me check again. For XSS, the attacker can modify the page's content, which affects the integrity of the user's session. So I:H. But if the attacker can't modify the server's data, then maybe I:N. Wait, the CVSS defines Integrity as the ability to modify the information that a component can access. So if the attacker can inject scripts, they can alter the page's content, which is part of the user's session. Therefore, the integrity is compromised. So I:H. So the final vector is AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. But I'm not 100% sure about UI. Let me check another source. According to the CVSS v3.1 documentation, for XSS, the User Interaction is Required (R) because the user must be tricked into clicking a link. So UI:R. Therefore, the answer should have UI:R. But maybe the answer expects UI:N. Wait, the example in the prompt's final line has UI:N. But that's just an example. So I think the correct answer here is UI:R. So the vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the user interaction is not required if the attack is through a form submission. But the description says the attacker injects the script into the id parameter, which is a URL parameter. So the user has to be tricked into visiting a malicious link, which requires user interaction. Therefore, UI:R. So the final answer should have UI:R. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 metrics again. The User Interaction (UI) metric is set to 'Required' if the attacker must have the user take some action, such as clicking a link. So yes, UI:R.

This is to prevent a possible integer underflow that might happen when copying the source scatterlist into a linear buffer.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a Linux kernel vulnerability related to the crypto module. The issue is an integer underflow when handling RSA reject requests with a source buffer larger than the key size. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, let's recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The metrics are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Each has specific options. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's crypto module. The problem occurs when copying a source scatterlist into a linear buffer. The underflow could be triggered by a buffer that's larger than the key size. Since this is a kernel-level issue, the attack vector would likely be Local (L) because the attacker needs to have local access to the system. However, sometimes if the vulnerability is exploitable via network, it might be Network (N). But the description mentions a source buffer, which suggests that the attacker needs to be on the same system. So AV is Local (L). Wait, but maybe the buffer could be accessed remotely? Hmm. The description says \"source buffer that is bigger than the size of the key.\" If the buffer is part of a network request, then AV could be Network. But the vulnerability is in the crypto module, which might be accessed via local processes. I think the attack vector here is Local because the attacker would need to have access to the system to trigger the buffer overflow. So AV: L.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires the attacker to provide a buffer larger than the key size. The underflow happens when copying the scatterlist. The complexity here is that the attacker needs to craft a specific input. However, the description doesn't mention any additional steps beyond the buffer size. So the attack complexity is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to have any special skills beyond providing the buffer. So AC: L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have some level of access. If the attacker is local, they might already have privileges. But the description doesn't specify if the exploit requires elevated privileges. Since it's a kernel vulnerability, the attacker might need to be local, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is local, they might not need any additional privileges beyond what's already there. So PR: N (None). Wait, but if the attacker is local, they might already have user privileges. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability can be exploited without needing any additional privileges beyond what's already present (like a local user), then PR is N. So PR: N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description doesn't mention any need for user interaction. The vulnerability is triggered by the buffer size, which could be part of a normal operation. So UI: N (None).\n\nScope (S). The scope refers to whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit could lead to privilege escalation, the scope might be Changed (C). Wait, but the original description doesn't mention privilege escalation. The underflow could lead to arbitrary code execution, which would change the scope. However, if the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, then the scope is Changed. But if the vulnerability is within the same component (like the kernel module), then the scope is Unchanged. Wait, the CVSS scope is about whether the vulnerability can be exploited to affect resources beyond those directly affected. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain root privileges, then the scope is Changed. But the description doesn't explicitly state that. However, the underflow could lead to arbitrary code execution, which would change the scope. So S: C.\n\nConfidentiality (C). If the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data, then C is High. But the underflow could lead to memory corruption, which might allow the attacker to read sensitive data. However, the description doesn't specify. But since it's a buffer overflow, it's possible that confidentiality could be compromised. However, the exact impact isn't clear. But given that it's a kernel vulnerability, the confidentiality could be High. So C: H.\n\nIntegrity (I). If the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data, then I is High. The underflow could lead to arbitrary code execution, which would allow modification of data. So I: H.\n\nAvailability (A). If the vulnerability leads to denial of service, then A is High. The underflow could cause a crash or resource exhaustion, leading to availability issues. So A: H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: C (Changed)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: H (High)\n\nThe vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the scope is correct. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, then the scope is Changed. But if the vulnerability is within the same component (like the kernel module), then the scope is Unchanged. However, the CVSS scope is about whether the attack can affect resources beyond those directly affected. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain root privileges, then the scope is Changed. But the description doesn't mention privilege escalation. However, the underflow could lead to arbitrary code execution, which would allow the attacker to take control of the system, thus changing the scope. Therefore, S: C.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 3.8000000000000007, "success": true}

Since the attacker needs to be logged in and have specific permissions, this is a Local (L) attack vector. Because the attacker has to be on the same system or have access to the user's account, it's not network-based. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description mentions that the attacker can inject scripts via the plugin's custom JS functionality. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any additional steps beyond exploiting the input sanitization flaw. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low privilege level. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but in CVSS, PR is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated (contributor-level), that's considered Low (L) because it's not requiring administrative privileges. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is Stored XSS, which means the script is stored on the server and executed when a user visits the page. However, the description says the attacker can inject scripts that execute when a user accesses the page. So the user doesn't need to interact with the exploit; it's automatic. Therefore, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope refers to whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since this is a XSS vulnerability, the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack affects the same component (the user's browser) and doesn't escalate to other components. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts, which can potentially steal user data. So there's a high confidentiality impact because the attacker can access sensitive information. Therefore, C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject scripts, which can alter the content of the page. This affects the integrity of the data. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't directly impact availability. The script execution might cause denial of service, but the description doesn't mention that. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but let me double-check. The user interaction is None because the script is stored and executed automatically. The scope is Unchanged. The attack vector is Local because the attacker needs to be authenticated. Privileges required are Low. So yes, that seems right. The final answer should be the vector string with these values.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 1.6999999999999993, "success": true}

Prior to version 25.4.0, the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently, conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization, which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result, the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions, conda-build creates a potential execution pathway for malicious code, violating security assumptions. This issue has been patched in version 25.4.0.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in Conda-build. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is due to using eval() on user input in meta.yaml files. Since the input is part of the build process, which is typically done locally by the user, the attack vector is Local (L). Wait, but wait—if the attacker needs to have access to the build environment, which is local, then AV is Local. But maybe if the attacker can somehow inject into the network? Hmm, the description says the issue is with processing recipe selectors in meta.yaml. So the attacker would need to have access to the build system, which is local. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is due to using eval() without sanitization. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any additional steps beyond providing the malicious input. The eval function is already being used, so the complexity is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker doesn't need any special privileges. They just need to have access to the build environment, which is local. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution during the build process. The user would need to have the malicious meta.yaml file, but the build process is automated. So maybe no user interaction is required. The description doesn't mention needing user input beyond the file, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the integrity of the build environment. Since the attack can lead to unauthorized commands, the scope is Changed (C) because the attack can affect resources beyond the initial component (the build process itself).\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows unauthorized commands, which could lead to data exposure. So Confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can access sensitive data.\n\nIntegrity (I). The build environment's integrity is compromised, allowing unauthorized modifications. So Integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A). The vulnerability could lead to denial of service if the attacker disrupts the build process. However, the description doesn't explicitly mention availability issues. But since the build process is critical, maybe Availability is High (H). Wait, but the main issue is about code execution, which could lead to DoS. However, the CVSS scoring for availability is based on whether the attack can cause denial of service. If the attacker can execute arbitrary code, they might crash the system, leading to availability loss. So A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:C, C:H, I:H, A:H. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H. Wait, but I need to check if the scope is correct. The original description says the vulnerability allows unauthorized commands or file operations. So the scope is changed because the attack can affect other components. So S:C is correct. \n\nWait, but sometimes the scope is unchanged if the attack doesn't affect other components. But in this case, the build environment's integrity is compromised, which could lead to other issues. So S:C is correct. \n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.5, "success": true}

The user provided a CVE description about a SQL Injection vulnerability in the Pollin plugin for WordPress.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the 'question' parameter, which is a user-supplied parameter. Since the attacker doesn't need to be authenticated and can exploit this remotely, the attack vector is Network (N). Because the parameter is sent over the network, the attacker can reach the target from a remote location. So AV:N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says that the vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping and lack of preparation on the SQL query. This suggests that the attack doesn't require any special setup. The attacker can just send the malicious input, so the complexity is Low (L). AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker is unauthenticated, so they don't need any privileges. PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description mentions that unauthenticated attackers can exploit this. There's no mention of needing user interaction, so UI:N.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability allows extracting sensitive information from the database. Since the attack affects the same component (the database) and doesn't change the scope (like escalating to a different component), the scope is Unchanged (U). S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The attacker can extract sensitive information, which is a high impact on confidentiality. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I). The description doesn't mention any modification of data, so Integrity is None (N). I:N.\n\nAvailability (A). Similarly, there's no mention of denial of service or availability impact. So A:N.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. The vulnerability is SQL Injection, which can lead to data extraction (confidentiality), but does it affect integrity or availability? If the attacker can modify data, then I would be High. But the description says \"extract sensitive information\", which is confidentiality. So I think I is N. Availability is also not mentioned, so A:N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\nWait, but sometimes SQL injection can have different impacts. Let me check again. The description says \"extract sensitive information from the database\", which is definitely a high confidentiality impact. But what about integrity? If the attacker can modify data, then I would be High. But the description doesn't mention that. It's only about extracting data. So I think Integrity is not affected here. So I:N. Availability is also not mentioned, so A:N.\n\nSo the final vector is as above. Let me make sure all the metrics are correctly assigned.

The user provided a CVE description about a Stored XSS vulnerability in a WordPress plugin. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the 'purechatWidgetName' parameter. Since the attacker doesn't need to be authenticated and can inject scripts through a parameter, which is typically a network-based attack. But wait, the description says it's a Stored XSS, which means the script is stored on the server. So the attack vector would be Network (N) because the attacker can send the malicious payload over the network, and the victim accesses the page, triggering the script. But wait, Stored XSS is usually considered as Local (L) because the attacker has to have some access to the server to store the payload. Hmm, maybe I need to think again. Wait, the user is unauthenticated, so the attack vector is Network. Because the attacker can send the payload via a network request, and the victim's browser executes it when they visit the page. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires the attacker to inject the script into the parameter, which is a single step. Since there's no additional complexity needed, AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker doesn't need any privileges; they can exploit this without being authenticated. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The user has to visit the page that contains the injected script. But the description says \"unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the user interaction is required for the script to execute. Wait, but the user interaction is required for the script to be triggered. However, in CVSS, UI is about whether the user has to interact with the exploit. For Stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact; the script is stored and executed when the user visits the page. Wait, but the user has to access the page. So maybe UI is None (N) because the user doesn't need to interact beyond visiting the page. Wait, but the user interaction is required for the exploit to work. Wait, no. The user interaction is required if the attacker needs the user to take some action, like clicking a link. In this case, the script is stored, so when the user visits the page, the script runs automatically. So UI is None (N). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. For Stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact beyond visiting the page. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component (the plugin), so the scope is Unchanged (U). Because the attack doesn't change the scope; it's within the same component.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The attacker can inject scripts, which can steal data. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can read sensitive information.\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can modify data via the script, so integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A). The attacker can cause denial of service, but the description doesn't mention that. So availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N.

The description says \"execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So maybe the attacker can cause the script to run, which could lead to DoS if the script is malicious. But the description doesn't mention availability impact. So A:N. But maybe the attacker can cause the site to crash, but that's not specified. So I think A:N is correct here.

The user provided a CVE description, and I need to figure out each of the base metrics. Let me start by recalling the CVSS v3.1 base metrics and their definitions.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attacker can intercept or manipulate metrics information through network traffic using a crafted certificate. Since the attacker is remote and doesn't need to be physically present, AV should be Network (N). That makes sense because the attack is over the network.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions that the attacker needs to intercept network traffic and use a crafted certificate. I need to determine if this is low or high complexity. If the attacker needs to perform multiple steps or has to have some specific setup, it's high. But if it's straightforward, like just intercepting traffic, maybe it's low.

Then we pass the result to uverbs_request_next_ptr() which also could potentially wrap. The \"cmd.sge_count * sizeof(struct ib_uverbs_sge)\" multiplication can also overflow on 32bit systems although it's fine on 64bit systems. This patch does two things. First, I've re-arranged the condition in uverbs_request_next_ptr() so that the use controlled variable \"len\" is on one side of the comparison by itself without any math. Then I've modified all the callers to use size_mul() for the multiplications.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to understand the CVE description. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to RDMA/uverbs. The issue is an integer overflow in the multiplication of user-provided values. The problem occurs when multiplying two u32 variables, which can wrap around, leading to potential issues. The patch changes the code to prevent this by rearranging conditions and using a helper function for multiplication.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is a system component. The attacker would need to have local access to exploit this, right? Because the variables come from the user, but the code is in the kernel. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker has to be on the same system. Wait, but sometimes if it's a kernel vulnerability, it could be considered as Network (N) if it's a remote exploit. But the description says the variables are from the user, which implies local access. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The patch changes the code to use size_mul(), which probably handles the overflow. But the original code had a multiplication that could overflow. The complexity here is that the attacker needs to provide the values that cause the overflow. Since the patch is about preventing the overflow, the original attack complexity is High (H) because the attacker has to perform the multiplication and exploit the overflow. But maybe the complexity is Low (L) if the attack is straightforward. Wait, the original code's multiplication is a simple operation. The complexity is High because the attacker has to manipulate the values to cause the overflow. So AC is High (H).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have local access to the kernel, so they need to be authenticated. But the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have local access. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, then PR is Low (L) because they don't need to escalate privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already in the system (local), then they don't need any additional privileges. So PR is None (N)? Wait, no. The PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attacker would need to have local access, which is considered as having some privileges. Wait, the PR options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated (i.e., have a user account), then PR is Low (L). But if the vulnerability can be exploited without any privileges, then it's None. But in this case, the attacker is local, so they have to be authenticated. So PR is Low (L)? Or is it None? Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, then they have the necessary privileges. So PR is None (N)? Wait, the PR metric is defined as the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already in the system (local), then they don't need any additional privileges. So PR is None (N). Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check. For example, if the vulnerability is in a user-space application, then PR would be None if the attacker can exploit it without any privileges. But in the kernel, the attacker is already local, so they have the necessary privileges. So PR is None (N). Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is local, they have the necessary privileges. So PR is None (N). But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have local access, which is considered as having some privileges. Alternatively, maybe the PR is None because the attacker is already in the system. I think in this case, since the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attacker is local, so they have the necessary privileges. Therefore, PR is None (N). Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, then they don't need any additional privileges. So PR is None (N). But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. For example, if the vulnerability is in a user-space application, and the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, then PR is None. If the attacker needs to be authenticated (like a user account), then PR is Low. But in the kernel, the attacker is already local, so they have the necessary privileges. So PR is None (N). Hmm, maybe I should go with PR: None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attacker can exploit it without any user interaction. The variables are from the user, but the attack is automated. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the patch is about preventing integer overflow, which could lead to privilege escalation or other issues. However, the original description doesn't mention scope change. The scope is Unchanged (U) if the vulnerability affects the same component. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges (like from user to root), then the scope is Changed (C). But the description doesn't mention that. The patch is about preventing integer overflow, which could lead to buffer overflows or other issues. However, the scope is Unchanged (U) unless the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attack is local, the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): If the vulnerability allows the attacker to read sensitive data, then C is High (H). But the description mentions integer overflow, which could lead to buffer overflows, but not necessarily data disclosure. However, the original code's multiplication could lead to incorrect memory allocation, which might allow reading or writing beyond allocated memory. But the description doesn't specify. Since the patch is about preventing integer overflow, which could lead to buffer overflows, which could allow reading or writing data. So C is High (H) if the attacker can read data. But the description doesn't explicitly state that. However, in the absence of specific information, I might have to assume that the vulnerability could lead to confidentiality issues. Alternatively, maybe it's not clear. But given that the patch is about preventing integer overflow, which could lead to buffer overflows, which could allow reading or writing data, I think C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): If the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data, then I is High (H). Again, buffer overflows could allow modifying data. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): If the vulnerability leads to denial of service, then A is High (H). The integer overflow could cause the system to crash or use excessive resources, leading to denial of service. So A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: High (H)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: High (H)\nI: High (H)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\nWait, but earlier I was confused about PR. Let me check again. If the attacker is local, then they have the necessary privileges. So PR is None (N). But some sources say that for kernel vulnerabilities, PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated. Wait, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, they have the necessary privileges. So PR is None (N). But maybe the answer is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have local access. Hmm. Let me check the CVSS documentation. According to CVSS v3.1, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already in the system (local), then they have the necessary privileges. So PR is None (N). But if the attacker needs to have a user account (i.e., be authenticated), then PR is Low (L). But in the case of a kernel vulnerability, the attacker is already local, so they have the necessary privileges. Therefore, PR is None (N). So I think that's correct.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.9000000000000004, "success": true}

Ensure platform_set_drvdata() is called before devm_pm_runtime_enable().\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to understand the CVE description. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the phy driver for Rockchip and Samsung HDPTX. The issue is that in some cases, the runtime resume function might be called before platform_set_drvdata() is executed in the probe method. This leads to a NULL pointer dereference because dev_get_drvdata() returns a NULL pointer, and then it's used, causing a crash.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is related to the kernel's internal operations, specifically during the probe method. The problem occurs when the runtime resume is called before the drvdata is set. Since this is a kernel-level issue, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to have local access to the system. However, if the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, it might be Network (N). But given that it's a driver issue and the problem is with the probe function, which is part of the kernel's internal handling, I think it's Local. Wait, but maybe the attacker doesn't need to be local. Wait, the vulnerability is in the kernel's code, so if an attacker can trigger the probe function, maybe through a local exploit. But the question is about the attack vector. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to have local access to the system to trigger the probe function. So AV: L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity here is whether the attacker needs to perform multiple steps. The vulnerability requires that the runtime resume is called before the drvdata is set. So the attacker needs to have the correct conditions where the probe is not yet completed. This might require some specific timing or conditions, which could be considered High (H) complexity. But if the attack is straightforward, maybe Low (L). However, since the attacker needs to trigger the resume before the probe is done, which might require some coordination, I think AC is High (H). Wait, but the problem is that the code is not properly ordered. The attack complexity might be Low if the attacker can just trigger the resume function without needing to know the exact timing. Hmm. Maybe it's Low because the attacker doesn't need to have any special knowledge beyond triggering the resume. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The attack complexity is about how hard it is for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it with minimal steps, then AC is Low. Since the vulnerability is a race condition or a sequence of events, maybe it's High. But the description doesn't mention any specific complexity. The problem is that the code is not properly ordered, so the attacker just needs to call the resume function before the probe is done. So maybe the attack complexity is Low because the attacker doesn't need to have any special knowledge beyond triggering the function. So AC: L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have some privileges to trigger the probe function. Since this is a kernel module, the attacker would need to have local access, but maybe not root privileges. However, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have local access to the system. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, then PR is N. But in this case, the attacker would need to have access to the system to trigger the probe function. So PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges beyond being able to access the system. Wait, but if the attacker is local, they might already have some privileges. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability can be exploited by a local user without needing to be root, then PR is Low (L). But the description doesn't specify. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attacker would need to have local access, but the PR metric is about the privileges required. If the attacker is a local user, they might not need any additional privileges. So PR: N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability doesn't require any user interaction. The problem occurs when the runtime resume is called before the drvdata is set. This can be triggered by the system's normal operations, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain privileges beyond the initial access. Since the vulnerability leads to a NULL pointer dereference, which could cause a crash, but the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope. The attacker can't elevate privileges beyond what they already have. So S: U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability leads to a NULL pointer dereference, which could cause a crash, but does it affect confidentiality? If the crash leads to data exposure, then C would be High. But the description doesn't mention data exposure. So C: N.\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the crash might not affect integrity. Unless the crash allows for arbitrary code execution, which isn't mentioned. So I: N.\n\nAvailability (A): The crash would affect availability, as the system might crash or become unstable. So A: H.\n\nWait, but the problem is a NULL pointer dereference. That's a crash, which would affect availability. So A is High. But the question is, does the crash lead to denial of service? Yes, so A: H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: L (Low complexity)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nBut wait, the user might have to be local, so PR is N. But if the attacker is a local user, then PR is N. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is a local user, they might not need any additional privileges. So PR: N.\n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but the answer example in the prompt has C:H, I:H, A:H. But in this case, the vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which is a crash. So the impact on availability is High. But confidentiality and integrity are not affected. So C:N, I:N, A:H.\n\nBut maybe the crash could lead to a denial of service, which is availability. So A:H.\n\nSo the final vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nBut I need to check again. Let me re-examine each metric.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): Local (L) because the attacker needs to be local to trigger the probe function.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L) because the attacker can trigger the resume function without needing to know specific timing, just the sequence of events.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges beyond local access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): None (N) because the attack can be triggered without user interaction.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't allow privilege escalation.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N) because no data is disclosed.\n\nIntegrity (I): None (N) because no data is modified.\n\nAvailability (A): High (H) because the crash leads to denial of service.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

The user provided a CVE description about an improper neutralization of input during web page generation in FortiClientEMS 6.2.0. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute unauthorized code by injecting a malicious payload in the user profile of a FortiClient instance.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the CVE description into the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let me recall the metrics: AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Each has specific options.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions a remote attacker. Since the attacker is remote, that suggests the attack vector is Network (N). But wait, sometimes if the attack requires being on the same network or adjacent, it might be different. However, the description says \"remote attacker,\" so AV:N is likely correct.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is about input injection. If the attacker can exploit it without much effort, like just sending a payload, then AC is Low (L). But if there are multiple steps or conditions, it might be High. The description doesn't mention complexity, so I'll assume it's Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to have some privileges? The description says \"unauthorized code execution,\" which might require the attacker to have some level of access. But since it's a remote attack, maybe no privileges are needed. Wait, but if the user profile is being manipulated, maybe the attacker needs to be authenticated. However, the description doesn't specify that. So PR:N (None) might be correct. But I need to be careful here. If the attacker can exploit it without any prior access, then PR:N. If they need to be authenticated, then PR:L. The description says \"user profile of a FortiClient instance being managed by the vulnerable system.\" So maybe the attacker needs to have access to the system, but the vulnerability is in the web page generation. If the attacker can inject via the web interface, maybe they need to be authenticated. But the description doesn't specify. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. However, since it's a remote code execution, perhaps the attacker doesn't need any privileges, so PR:N. I'll go with PR:N for now.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says the attacker injects a payload in the user profile. If the user has to interact, like clicking a link, then UI:R. But if the attack is automatic, like the payload is executed without user action, then UI:N. The description doesn't mention user interaction, so I think UI:N is correct.\n\nScope (S). The scope refers to whether the vulnerability affects a different component. If the attack can be used to gain higher privileges or affect other components, then S:C. Otherwise, S:U. The description mentions executing unauthorized code, which could be a privilege escalation, so maybe the scope is changed. But the original component is the web page generation. If the attack leads to code execution, which is a different component, then S:C. However, sometimes code execution is considered a separate scope. I need to check. If the vulnerability allows code execution, which is a different impact, then the scope is changed. So S:C.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The description says \"execute unauthorized code,\" which affects integrity (since code execution can alter system state) and availability (if the code execution leads to denial of service). But the main impact here is code execution, which is typically considered as Integrity (I:H) and Availability (A:H) if it's a DoS. However, the exact impact depends on the exploit. Since the attacker can execute code, that's a high integrity impact (since they can modify data) and high availability (if the code execution causes the system to crash). But sometimes code execution is considered as a high integrity and availability. However, the original description says \"execute unauthorized code,\" which might be more about integrity (modifying system behavior) and availability (if the code execution leads to system downtime). But the exact metrics need to be determined. Let me think again. The CVSS metrics for C, I, A are about the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. If the code execution allows the attacker to read sensitive data, that's C:H. If they can modify data, I:H. If they can cause denial of service, A:H. Since the description says \"execute unauthorized code,\" which could be a way to take control, leading to all three. But the question is, which of the three are affected. The original problem is about input injection leading to code execution. So, the attacker can execute code, which would allow them to modify data (I:H), read data (C:H), and possibly cause DoS (A:H). However, the CVSS base metrics are about the impact. So, for each of C, I, A, we need to determine if they are high, low, or none. The description doesn't specify exactly which aspects are affected, but code execution typically implies high impact on all three. However, the CVSS base metrics are about the maximum impact. So, if the vulnerability allows code execution, then the attacker can potentially read, modify, and disrupt the system. Therefore, C:H, I:H, A:H. But I need to check if the original description specifies. The description says \"execute unauthorized code by injecting malicious payload in the user profile.\" So, the code execution could be used to modify the user profile (integrity), read data (confidentiality), or cause a DoS (availability). Therefore, all three are high. So C:H, I:H, A:H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (remote attack)\nAC:L (low complexity)\nPR:N (no privileges needed)\nUI:N (no user interaction)\nS:C (scope changed)\nC:H, I:H, A:H\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\nWait, but I need to check if the scope is correct. If the vulnerability allows code execution, which is a different component, then the scope is changed. So S:C. But sometimes, if the code execution is within the same component, maybe S:U. However, in this case, the code execution could be considered a different scope. For example, if the vulnerability is in the web page generation, but the code execution could lead to taking control of the system, which is a different component. Therefore, S:C.\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. If the code execution is part of the same component (like the web server), then S:U. But if the code execution leads to a different component (like the system's core), then S:C. Since the description mentions FortiClientEMS and FortiClient instances, maybe the code execution is within the same system, so S:U. Wait, the original system is FortiClientEMS, and the FortiClient instances are being managed. So the attack is on the FortiClientEMS system, which manages the FortiClient instances. If the attacker can execute code on the FortiClientEMS system, then the scope is unchanged. But if the code execution allows the attacker to access other components (like the FortiClient instances), then the scope is changed. The description says \"execute unauthorized code by injecting malicious payload in the user profile of a FortiClient instance being managed by the vulnerable system.\" So the attack is on the FortiClientEMS system, which is managing the FortiClient instances. The code execution would be on the FortiClientEMS system, so the scope is unchanged. Therefore, S:U. Wait, but the code execution could be on the FortiClient instance, which is a different component. But the description says the FortiClient instance is being managed by the vulnerable system (FortiClientEMS). So the attack is on the FortiClientEMS system, which is the vulnerable component. If the code execution is on the FortiClientEMS system, then the scope is unchanged. If the code execution is on the FortiClient instance, which is a different component, then the scope is changed. The description says the attacker injects the payload in the user profile of a FortiClient instance. So the attack is on the FortiClient instance, which is managed by the FortiClientEMS. Therefore, the vulnerability is in the FortiClientEMS system, but the attack is on the FortiClient instance. So the scope is changed. Therefore, S:C.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me check the CVSS scope definition. Scope (S) is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. If the attack can be used to gain access to a different component, then S:C. If the attack is within the same component, S:U. In this case, the FortiClientEMS is the system with the vulnerability. The attack is on the FortiClient instance, which is a different component. Therefore, the scope is changed. So S:C.\n\nSo the final vector would be:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:C, C:H, I:H, A:H.\n\nTherefore, the vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 3.9000000000000004, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in the WPBakery Page Builder plugin. The goal is to determine each base metric and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The metrics are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description says the vulnerability is via the Grid Builder feature, and attackers need to be authenticated with author-level access. Since the attack requires the attacker to be authenticated and have access to the system (like an author), this suggests the attack vector is Local (L). Because the attacker has to be logged in and have access to the application, it's not over the network or adjacent. So AV:L.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any special steps beyond exploiting the input handling flaw. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker needs to be authenticated (author-level access) but the PR metric refers to the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Wait, the description says \"authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above\". So the attacker needs to have author-level access, which is a privilege. But in CVSS, PR is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered a low privilege requirement. Wait, the PR metric has options: None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered a low privilege requirement because it's not requiring administrative privileges. So PR:L? Wait, no. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated (i.e., have a user account), that's considered a low privilege requirement. So PR:L. But I need to check. For example, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a low privilege requirement. So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says the attacker can inject scripts that execute when a user accesses the page. The user interaction is required? Wait, the attacker injects the script, and then the user has to access the page. So the user interaction is required. Wait, the UI metric is whether user interaction is required for the attack to succeed. If the attacker injects the script, and then the user has to click on a link or something, then UI:R. But if the script is automatically executed when the user accesses the page, maybe no user interaction is needed. Wait, the description says \"inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the user just needs to access the page, which is part of normal browsing. So the user doesn't need to interact with the page beyond accessing it. Therefore, UI:N. Because the attack doesn't require any user interaction beyond the initial access. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new vulnerability that affects a different component. The description says the attacker can inject scripts, which would affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Since the attack is on the same component (the plugin), the scope is Unchanged (U). So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can inject scripts, which could potentially steal data. So confidentiality is High (H). Because the attacker can read sensitive information from the user's session or other data.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject scripts, which could modify the page content. So integrity is High (H) because the attacker can alter data.\n\nAvailability (A): The attacker could potentially cause denial of service by injecting scripts that consume resources. But the description doesn't mention availability impact. However, if the script is malicious, it could lead to DoS. But the description doesn't specify that. So maybe A:N. Wait, but the CVSS requires us to assess based on the description. The description says the attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts. If the script is a malicious payload, it could potentially cause availability issues, but the description doesn't explicitly mention that. So maybe A:N. But sometimes, if the attack can lead to DoS, it's considered High. However, the description doesn't specify that. So I think A:N.\n\nWait, but the original question says to determine the values based on the CVE description. The description says the attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. So the main impact is on confidentiality (stealing data) and integrity (modifying content). Availability isn't mentioned. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:L (Local), AC:L (Low complexity), PR:L (Low privileges required), UI:N (No user interaction), S:U (Scope unchanged), C:H (Confidentiality high), I:H (Integrity high), A:N (Availability none).\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the PR. The attacker needs to be authenticated with author-level access. So the PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some level of access, but not administrative. So PR:L is correct.\n\nYes, that seems right.

Under certain conditions, an attacker could potentially trick users into unintentionally authorizing sensitive actions on their behalf.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description, and I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let me start by understanding the description.\n\nThe CVE is about GitLab CE/EE versions up to certain points. The issue is that an attacker could trick users into authorizing sensitive actions unintentionally. So, the main point here is that the attacker is able to manipulate users into performing actions they didn't intend, which sounds like a social engineering or phishing scenario.\n\nFirst, let's go through each metric one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The description mentions that the attacker could trick users. This implies that the attack is not through a direct network exploit but rather through some form of user interaction, like a phishing link or a malicious website. However, the attack vector here might be \"Network\" if the attacker is exploiting a vulnerability that allows remote access. Wait, but the description says the attacker tricks users into authorizing actions. That might be more of a user interaction scenario. Wait, but the attack vector is about how the attack is delivered. If the attacker needs to trick the user, maybe the attack vector is \"Local\" if the user is on the same network, but that's not clear. Alternatively, if the attacker can send a malicious link (like a phishing email), that would be \"Network\" because the attack is delivered over the network. But the user is tricked into authorizing, which might require some form of user interaction. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The attack vector is how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can send a malicious link (like a phishing link) that the user clicks, then the attack vector is Network (N). But if the attacker needs to be on the same network or have local access, it would be different. The description doesn't specify, but the fact that it's about tricking users into authorizing suggests that the attack is not through a direct exploit but through social engineering. However, in CVSS, the attack vector is about the path the attacker takes to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, then AV is Network. If it's local, then Local. But the description doesn't mention local access. So maybe AV is Network. Wait, but the user is tricked into authorizing, which might require some form of user interaction. Wait, the Attack Vector is about the method of delivery. If the attacker can send a malicious link (like a phishing email) that the user clicks, then the attack vector is Network. But if the user has to be on the same network, then it's Adjacent. However, the description doesn't specify. Since the user is tricked into authorizing, maybe the attack vector is Network because the attacker can send a malicious link (like a phishing link) over the network. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says \"under certain conditions\" but doesn't specify if the attack requires multiple steps. Since the user is tricked into authorizing, maybe the complexity is Low because the attacker doesn't need to have any special knowledge beyond tricking the user. But I'm not sure. If the attack requires the user to click a link, that's a low complexity. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any privileges to exploit this. The user is tricked into authorizing, so the attacker doesn't need to have any prior access. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The user has to interact with the attack, like clicking a link or authorizing something. So UI:R (Required). Wait, but the description says \"trick users into unintentionally authorizing\". So the user interaction is required. So UI:R.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the attack affects a different component. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain access to other components, then scope is Changed (C). But the description doesn't mention that. It's about authorizing actions, which might be within the same component. So S:U (Unchanged).\n\nConfidentiality (C): If the attacker can access sensitive information, then C is High. The description mentions \"sensitive actions on their behalf\", which could imply that the attacker can access confidential data. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I): If the attacker can modify data, then I is High. The description says \"authorizing sensitive actions\", which might involve modifying user permissions or data. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A): The description doesn't mention any impact on availability. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:N (None), UI:R (Required), S:U (Unchanged), C:H (High), I:H (High), A:N (None).\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the user interaction is required. The user has to click on a link or authorize something, which is required. So UI:R. But some might argue that if the user is tricked, maybe the attack is considered to have no user interaction. Wait, no. The user interaction is required for the attack to succeed. For example, if the attacker sends a phishing link, the user has to click it. So UI:R is correct.\n\nAnother point: the scope. If the attack allows the attacker to gain access to other components, then scope is changed. But the description doesn't mention that. It's about authorizing actions, which might be within the same component. So S:U.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "score": 1.5999999999999996, "success": true}

The vulnerability is due to improper handling of form-data with a large filename in the file upload request. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a payload with an excessively large filename, causing the server to become overwhelmed and unavailable for legitimate users.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a DoS vulnerability in a file upload feature. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the file upload feature, and the attacker needs to send a payload with a large filename. Since the server is being overwhelmed, the attack is likely through the network. So AV should be Network (N). But wait, if the attacker has to be on the same network or adjacent, maybe? But the description doesn't mention anything about local access. The server is being targeted via the network, so AV:N makes sense.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is due to improper handling of form-data with a large filename. The attacker just needs to send a payload with a large filename. That seems like a low complexity because it doesn't require any special setup or privileges. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker doesn't need any prior access or privileges. They can exploit this from the network. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says the attacker sends a payload, and the server becomes overwhelmed. There's no mention of needing user interaction, like clicking a link or something. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability causes the server to become unavailable, which affects the availability. But does it change the scope? The scope is about whether the attack affects a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the file upload feature, and the impact is on the same component (server), the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the DoS affects the availability, does that count as a different scope? Hmm. The scope is whether the attack impacts a different component. If the attack is on the same component, then S:U. But if the attack leads to a different component being affected, like a different service, then S:C. But in this case, the server itself is the component being attacked, so the scope remains unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability doesn't mention data being disclosed. The server is overwhelmed, so confidentiality isn't affected. So C:N.\n\nIntegrity (I). Similarly, the server's integrity isn't compromised. The attacker isn't modifying data, just causing a DoS. So I:N.\n\nAvailability (A). The server becomes unavailable, which is a high impact. So A:H.\n\nWait, but the CVSS scoring for availability is High (H) if the attack results in denial of service. So A:H.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. Then the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the user's example had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nThe description says the server becomes overwhelmed and unavailable. So the impact is on availability. But what about confidentiality and integrity? The vulnerability is a DoS, which affects availability. So C and I are not affected. So C:N, I:N, A:H. But maybe the user thought that the DoS could lead to data loss or something? No, the description doesn't mention that. So the correct values are C:N, I:N, A:H.\n\nWait, but sometimes DoS can be considered as affecting availability. So the answer should have A:H. So the vector is as above. Let me confirm each metric again.\n\nAV:N because the attack is over the network. AC:L because the attacker just needs to send a large filename, which is a simple payload. PR:N because no privileges needed. UI:N because no user interaction. S:U because the attack doesn't change the scope. C:N, I:N, A:H. So the final vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the example given in the problem had C:H, I:H, A:H. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the original CVE description again.\n\nThe description says the server becomes overwhelmed and unavailable. So the impact is on availability. But maybe the DoS is considered as a high impact on availability. So A:H. But for C and I, since there's no data disclosure or modification, they are N. So the answer should be as above. But maybe the user expects different values. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the attack could be considered as having a high impact on availability, but the other metrics are correct. So the final vector is as I wrote.

By default, the GID is the user's phone number unless they specifically opt out. A phone number is very sensitive information because it can be tied back to individuals. The app does not encrypt the GID in messages.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description. The issue is with goTenna v1 devices where the GID (Group ID) is the user's phone number by default unless they opt out. The app doesn't encrypt the GID in messages, making phone numbers sensitive.\n\nSo, the main problem here is that the GID is exposed in messages without encryption. Let's break down each metric.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The attacker needs to be able to access the messages. Since the GID is part of the messages, if the attacker can intercept those messages, they can get the phone number. But how is the attack vector? If the messages are sent over a network, then the attack vector would be Network (N). But wait, the GID is part of the message content. If the attacker is on the same network, maybe they can intercept the messages. But the description doesn't specify if the messages are transmitted over a network or via some other method. However, since it's a device communicating with others, it's likely over a network. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The attacker needs to intercept the messages. If the attacker can do this without any special tools, maybe it's low complexity. But the app doesn't encrypt, so the complexity is low. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any special privileges. They just need to intercept the messages. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attacker doesn't need user interaction. They can just intercept the messages. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the GID is part of the app's data, and the issue is about the data being exposed, the scope is unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The GID is sensitive info (phone number). If the attacker can get it, they can compromise confidentiality. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I): The GID isn't being modified, so the integrity isn't directly affected. Unless the attacker can change the GID, but the description doesn't mention that. So I:N.\n\nAvailability (A): The issue doesn't affect availability. The messages are still available, just not encrypted. So A:N.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check again. The problem is that the GID is not encrypted, so if an attacker can read the messages, they can get the phone number. That's a confidentiality issue. So C:H. Integrity isn't affected because the data isn't being altered. Availability isn't affected either. So the vector would be AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. But wait, the user might have to be on the same network. Wait, the attack vector could be Local (L) if the attacker is on the same network as the device. But the description says the GID is in the messages, which are sent over the network. So if the attacker is on the same network, they can intercept the messages. But if the attack vector is Network (N), then that's correct. Alternatively, if the attacker needs to be adjacent to the device, like in the same local network, then AV:A. But the description doesn't specify. Since the app is sending messages, which are likely over a network, AV:N is more accurate. So I'll stick with AV:N.\n\nSo the final vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Wait, but the user might have to be on the same network. But the problem is that the GID is in the messages, so if the attacker can intercept the messages, which is a network-based attack. So AV:N is correct.

This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to perform Arbitrary File Write, enabling them to write arbitrary files to the victim's file system. This can potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by writing malicious files such as `__init__.py` in the Python's `/site-packages/` directory.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the eosphoros-ai/db-gpt version v0.6.0. The web API endpoint POST /api/v1/editor/chart/run allows execution of arbitrary SQL queries without access control. Attackers can exploit this to perform Arbitrary File Write, which can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by writing malicious files like __init__.py in the Python's /site-packages/ directory.\n\nAlright, the goal is to calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score by determining each of the base metrics: AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in a web API, so the attack vector is over the network. The attacker doesn't need to be physically present or have local access. So AV should be Network (N). That's straightforward.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says the API allows execution of arbitrary SQL queries without any access control. So the attack doesn't require any special setup or complex steps. The attacker can just send a malicious request. Therefore, Attack Complexity is Low (L). Because there's no need for additional steps, it's low complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability doesn't mention any need for the attacker to have existing privileges. The attacker can exploit it without needing to authenticate or have any prior access. So PR is None (N). \n\nUser Interaction (UI). The exploit doesn't require any user interaction. The attacker can send the request automatically. So UI is None (N). \n\nScope (S). The vulnerability allows the attacker to write arbitrary files, which could lead to RCE. The scope here refers to whether the attack affects a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the web API and the attack can lead to RCE, which is a different component (the system's execution environment), the scope is Changed (C). Wait, but I need to check. The original component is the web API, and the attack could lead to RCE, which is a different component. So the scope is Changed. So S is C.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows writing files, which could lead to RCE. However, the immediate impact on confidentiality isn't clear. The attacker could potentially read files if they have access, but the main issue here is the ability to write files. However, the description mentions Arbitrary File Write, which might not directly impact confidentiality. Wait, but if the attacker can write files, they might be able to read other files if they have access. But the main issue here is the ability to execute code, which affects integrity and availability. However, the CVSS metrics are about the impact. Let me think again. The original vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary SQL queries. The impact here is that the attacker can write arbitrary files, which could lead to RCE. So for confidentiality, if the attacker can read files, that's a high impact. But the description doesn't mention that. The main exploit is writing files, which could be used to execute code. So maybe confidentiality isn't directly affected. Wait, but the problem is that the attacker can write files, which might not directly impact confidentiality. However, if the attacker can write to the file system, they might be able to access other files if they have the right permissions. But the original description doesn't specify that. So maybe confidentiality is not directly impacted. However, the RCE could allow the attacker to read data from the system. But the CVSS metrics are about the direct impact. Since the vulnerability allows writing files, which could be used to execute code, but the immediate impact on confidentiality might be low. Wait, but the problem is that the attacker can write files, which could be used to read other files. However, the CVSS metrics are about the impact of the vulnerability. So for confidentiality, if the attacker can read data, that's high. But in this case, the vulnerability allows writing, not reading. So maybe confidentiality is not directly affected. However, the RCE could allow the attacker to read data. But the CVSS metrics are based on the direct impact of the vulnerability. So perhaps confidentiality is not directly affected. Wait, but the problem is that the attacker can write files, which could be used to read other files. But the original vulnerability is about writing, not reading. So maybe confidentiality is not directly impacted. Therefore, confidentiality (C) would be None (N). Wait, but the RCE could allow the attacker to read data. However, the CVSS metrics are about the impact of the vulnerability itself. So if the vulnerability allows the attacker to write files, which could be used to read data, but the direct impact is on integrity and availability. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the CVSS definitions again. \n\nConfidentiality (C) is the impact on the confidentiality of the information. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data, then C is High. If the attacker can't read data, then it's None. In this case, the vulnerability allows writing files, which could be used to read data if the attacker can access those files. But the original vulnerability is about writing, not reading. So maybe the direct impact on confidentiality is None. However, the RCE could allow the attacker to read data. But the CVSS metrics are based on the direct impact of the vulnerability. So perhaps the answer is that confidentiality is not directly impacted, so C is None (N). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the attacker can write files that could be used to read data, but that's an indirect effect. So maybe C is None. \n\nWait, but the problem states that the vulnerability allows Arbitrary File Write, which can lead to RCE. So the RCE is a consequence of the file write. So the direct impact of the vulnerability is the ability to write files, which could be used for RCE. So for the CVSS metrics, the impact is based on the vulnerability's direct effect. So the direct effect is the ability to write files, which could be used for RCE. So for confidentiality, the attacker can't directly read data, so C is None. But if the attacker can write files, they might be able to read other files if they have access. But that's not directly part of the vulnerability. So maybe C is None. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the attacker can write files that could be used to read data. But that's an indirect effect. So the CVSS metrics are about the direct impact. Therefore, C is None. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The vulnerability allows the attacker to write arbitrary files. If the attacker can write to the file system, they might be able to read other files if they have access. But the original vulnerability doesn't mention that. So maybe the direct impact on confidentiality is None. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the attacker can write files that could be used to read data. But that's an indirect effect. So the CVSS metrics are about the direct impact. Therefore, C is None. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check the example. For example, if a vulnerability allows the attacker to read files, then C is High. If it allows writing, then maybe C is None. But if the attacker can write to the file system, they might be able to read other files. However, that's not a direct impact. So I think C is None. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the vulnerability can lead to RCE. RCE would allow the attacker to execute code, which could then read data. But the CVSS metrics are about the impact of the vulnerability itself. So the direct impact is the ability to write files, which could be used for RCE. So the direct impact on confidentiality is None. \n\nSo I'll go with C: None (N). \n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can write arbitrary files, which could be used to modify the system's code or data. For example, writing a malicious __init__.py file in the Python's site-packages directory would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code. So this directly affects the integrity of the system. Therefore, I is High (H). \n\nAvailability (A). The attacker could potentially cause denial of service by writing files that disrupt the system. For example, writing a file that causes the application to crash or consume resources. However, the description mentions RCE, which is more about integrity. But the availability could be impacted if the attacker can cause the system to crash. However, the description doesn't explicitly mention that. So maybe A is None (N). But if the RCE can be used to execute code that leads to DoS, then A could be High. However, the problem states that the vulnerability can lead to RCE, which is a high impact on integrity. But availability is about the system's availability. If the attacker can execute code, they might be able to cause a DoS, but that's not explicitly stated.

First, I need to understand the CVE description. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to ksmbd. The issue is a type confusion via a race condition when using ipc_msg_send_request. The problem is that req->handle is allocated with ksmbd_acquire_id, which uses ida_alloc. There's a race where handles from different requests could be the same, leading to type confusion. The kernel checks the type of the ipc response but doesn't check further, leading to accessing unexpected memory.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so an attacker would need to be in a position to exploit it. Since it's a race condition, maybe it's local? Wait, the description mentions that the handles can be same between different requests. If the attacker is local, they can exploit this. But if it's a race condition that could be triggered remotely, maybe AV is Network? Wait, the vulnerability is in the kernel's ipc handling. If the attacker is on the same system, it's Local (L). But if the race condition can be exploited remotely, maybe AV is Network. Hmm. The description says it's a race condition when using ipc_msg_send_request. The ipc is probably local, so AV is Local (L). But I need to check. If the attacker needs to be on the same system, then AV is Local. So AV: L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The race condition requires the attacker to have some timing or coordination. Since it's a race, the complexity is High (H) because the attacker has to exploit the race condition, which is more complex. So AC: H.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have some privileges. But the description doesn't mention needing elevated privileges. If the attacker is local, maybe they don't need any privileges. Wait, but the vulnerability is in the kernel, so maybe the attacker is already in the system. So PR is None (N). Or maybe the attacker needs to be a local user, which would be PR: L? Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is a local user, they might not need any privileges beyond being logged in. But if the vulnerability allows privilege escalation, then PR would be Low or High. However, the description doesn't mention privilege escalation. It's a type confusion leading to memory access. So PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges beyond being able to trigger the race condition. So PR: N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a race condition. Does it require user interaction? The description doesn't mention any. The race condition is likely triggered by the attacker's actions without needing user input. So UI: None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges or access to other resources. Since the vulnerability is a type confusion leading to memory access, but the scope is unchanged if it's within the same privilege level. The description doesn't mention changing the scope, so S: Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows access to unexpected memory, which could lead to information disclosure. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): Type confusion could allow modifying data structures, leading to integrity issues. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability could lead to memory corruption, which might cause denial of service. So A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:H, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:H. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. Wait, but I need to check if the attack vector is Local or Network. The vulnerability is in the kernel's ipc handling. If the ipc is local, then AV is Local. But if the ipc is over a network, then AV is Network. The description mentions ipc_msg_send_request and FSCTL_PIPE_TRANSCEIVE ioctl. The FSCTL_PIPE_TRANSCEIVE is a Windows API, but the vulnerability is in Linux's ksmbd, which is a SMB server. So the ipc is likely local, so AV is Local (L). So the vector is correct as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 2.7, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private or draft posts created by Elementor that they should not have access to.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in the Typer Core plugin for WordPress. The goal is to determine the base metrics and then construct the CVSS vector string.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The metrics are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one based on the description.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability allows authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access to extract data from private or draft posts. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the system, this seems like a Local (L) attack vector. Because the attacker is already logged in, they can access the system locally. So AV is L.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions that the issue is due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. The attacker doesn't need to perform any additional steps beyond exploiting the vulnerability. So the complexity is Low (L). AC is L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to have Contributor-level access or higher. That's a Low (L) privilege requirement because it's not requiring root or admin access, just a contributor. So PR is L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says the attacker can extract data without needing user interaction. The vulnerability is triggered by the attacker's actions, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability allows the attacker to access data they shouldn't, but the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope of the impact. The attacker is accessing data within the same scope (same user's data). Wait, but the description says the attacker can access private or draft posts created by Elementor. If the attacker is a contributor, maybe they can access data that's supposed to be private. But the scope here refers to whether the attack affects a different component. Since the attacker is accessing data within the same system, the scope is Unchanged (U). So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows extraction of data from private or draft posts. That's a High (H) impact on confidentiality because the attacker can read sensitive information. So C is H.\n\nIntegrity (I). The description doesn't mention any modification of data. The attacker is extracting data, not altering it. So Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A). Similarly, there's no mention of denial of service or resource consumption. So Availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Wait, but the example given in the problem had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I made a mistake with Integrity and Availability. Let me check again.\n\nThe description says the attacker can extract data from private or draft posts. That's about confidentiality. But what about integrity? If the attacker can read data, does that affect integrity? No, integrity is about modifying data. Since the attacker is only reading, not modifying, I remains N. Availability is about making the system unavailable, which isn't mentioned here. So A is N. So the vector is correct as above. But wait, the example in the problem had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I need to check if the vulnerability allows for more than just confidentiality. Let me re-read the CVE description.\n\nThe vulnerability is \"Information Exposure\", which is about confidentiality. So C is High. Integrity and Availability are not affected. So I and A are N. So the vector is correct.

As a result, rtllib_beacons_stop() will block forever. This patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of spin_lock_irqsave(), which could let timer handler to obtain the needed lock.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to understand the CVE description. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's rtl8192e driver, specifically a deadlock in rtllib_beacons_stop(). The issue is that two threads are trying to acquire the same spin lock, leading to a deadlock. The patch fixes this by moving del_timer_sync() out of the spin lock's protection.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so it's a local exploit. But wait, the description mentions threads, which are part of the same process. So the attacker would need local access. So AV is Local (L). Wait, but the problem is between threads, which are part of the same process. So the attack vector is Local. So AV: L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability requires the attacker to have two threads in a specific state. The complexity is high because the attacker needs to coordinate the threads to trigger the deadlock. So AC: High (H).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be in the same process, so they already have local privileges. So PR: None (N) because no additional privileges are needed beyond local access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The exploit doesn't require user interaction. It's a race condition or deadlock that can be triggered without user input. So UI: None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability affects the same component (kernel) and doesn't allow elevation of privilege. The patch is about preventing a deadlock, not changing the scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a deadlock, which could lead to denial of service, but not directly leaking data. So C: None (N) unless the deadlock leads to data exposure. But the description doesn't mention that. So C: N.\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the integrity isn't directly affected. The deadlock might cause the system to hang, but not alter data. So I: N.\n\nAvailability (A): The deadlock causes the system to hang, which affects availability. So A: High (H).\n\nWait, but the CVSS scoring for availability is based on the impact. If the vulnerability leads to denial of service, then A is High. So yes, A: H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: H (High)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the scope is changed. The scope is Unchanged because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to gain privileges or affect a different component. So S:U is correct.\n\nBut wait, the original question says the vulnerability is a deadlock. So the impact is on availability. So A is High. The other metrics are as above.

The issue is with a JSON implementation in Ruby. The problem occurs in versions 2.10.0 up to 2.10.2, where a specially crafted document can cause an out-of-bound read, leading to a crash. The fix is version 2.10.2.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted document. Since the JSON parser is part of the application, an attacker would need to send this crafted document to the application. That would be a network attack because the exploit is through the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says it's a specially crafted document. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any additional steps beyond crafting the document. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any prior privileges. The vulnerability is in the JSON parsing, which is a core part of the application. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The exploit can be triggered by sending the malicious document, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope refers to whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the issue is in the JSON parser, which is part of the same component, the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The out-of-bound read could lead to data exposure, but the description mentions a crash. However, the exact impact isn't clear. But since it's an out-of-bound read, it might allow reading memory, which could be sensitive. So I think C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The crash might not directly affect data integrity unless the crash leads to data corruption. But the description doesn't mention that. So I would say I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The crash would affect availability, as the application would crash. So A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H. Wait, but I need to check again. The original description says \"most likely resulting in a crash.\" So the availability impact is High. But for integrity, if the crash is due to an out-of-bound read, maybe there's no integrity impact. So I think I is None. But sometimes, if the crash is due to memory corruption, it could affect integrity. However, the description doesn't specify that. So I'll stick with I:N.\n\nWait, but the user might have to consider if the crash could lead to data corruption. But since the CVE says \"out of bound read\", which is more about reading memory, not writing. So integrity isn't directly affected. So I:N is correct.\n\nSo the final vector is AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:H. Let me check again. The crash would definitely impact availability. So A:H. Confidentiality is high because of the out-of-bound read, which could expose memory contents. So C:H. Integrity is not mentioned, so N. Scope is unchanged.

The user provided a CVE description about a race condition in Dell Display Manager versions before 2.3.2.20. The vulnerability allows a local malicious user to exploit it during installation, leading to arbitrary folder or file deletion.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The description says the user is local, so AV should be Local (L). Wait, but the exploit is during installation. Hmm, maybe the attack vector is Local because the attacker needs physical access or local access. But the description mentions \"local malicious user,\" so AV is Local (L).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is a race condition. Race conditions typically require some specific timing, which might be considered low complexity because the attacker doesn't need to have a lot of steps. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user is already a local user, so maybe no additional privileges are needed. But the description says \"local malicious user,\" so PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to escalate privileges. Wait, but if the user is already local, maybe PR is Low (L)? Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already a local user, then they might not need any additional privileges. So PR is None (N). But I need to check. If the vulnerability requires the attacker to have local access, then PR is N. So I think PR is N here.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The exploit occurs during installation. Does the user need to interact? The description doesn't mention any user interaction, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows deletion of files, which affects confidentiality (C) and integrity (I). Since the scope is unchanged (the same component is affected), S is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the vulnerability allows deletion, which is an integrity issue, but the scope is whether the attack affects other components. Since the attack is on the same component (the display manager), the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows deletion, which doesn't directly affect confidentiality. So C is None (N). Wait, but maybe if the attacker can delete files, they could access sensitive data. Hmm, but the description says \"arbitrary folder or file deletion,\" which is more about integrity. So C is N.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can delete files, which is a high impact on integrity. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability allows deletion, which could lead to denial of service if critical files are deleted. So A is High (H).\n\nWait, but the description says \"arbitrary folder or file deletion.\" So that's a high impact on integrity (I:H) and possibly availability (A:H) if the files are critical. But the CVSS metrics are separate. So for I, it's High because the attacker can modify or delete data. For A, if the deletion could lead to system unavailability, then A is High. But maybe the user didn't specify that. However, the CVSS scoring might consider that deletion could impact availability. So A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: High (H)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H.\n\nWait, but I need to check again. Let me verify each metric again.\n\nAttack Vector: Local (L) because the attacker is local. The exploit is during installation, which is a local context.\n\nAttack Complexity: Low (L) because the race condition might be exploited with minimal steps.\n\nPrivileges Required: None (N) because the attacker is already a local user, so no additional privileges needed.\n\nUser Interaction: None (N) because the exploit is during installation, which might be automated.\n\nScope: Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't affect other components.\n\nConfidentiality: None (N) because the vulnerability is about deletion, not data exposure.\n\nIntegrity: High (H) because the attacker can delete files, which is a high impact on integrity.\n\nAvailability: High (H) because deleting critical files could lead to system unavailability.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

It may have been possible for private repository to be cloned in case of race condition when a secondary node is out of sync.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about GitLab EE. First, I need to parse the description to understand the vulnerability.\n\nThe issue is a race condition in private repositories when a secondary node is out of sync. So, the problem is that a private repo might be cloned if there's a race condition. Let me break down the metrics one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is related to a race condition in a secondary node. Since the secondary node is part of a cluster, maybe the attack is through the network? Or is it local? Wait, the secondary node is part of the same system, so maybe the attack is local? But the race condition could be exploited over the network if the secondary node is a remote server. Hmm. The description says \"when a secondary node is out of sync.\" If the secondary node is a remote node, then the attack vector would be Network (N). But if the attacker has local access to the secondary node, then it's Local (L). The description doesn't specify, but since it's a cluster setup, maybe the secondary node is part of the same network. But the vulnerability is in the case where the secondary node is out of sync. So maybe the attacker can exploit this through the network. I think AV:N is more likely here because the secondary node is part of the same system, but the race condition could be triggered remotely. Wait, maybe the attack is local because the attacker needs to be on the same network or have access to the secondary node. Alternatively, if the secondary node is a remote server, then it's network. But the description doesn't specify. I'll have to make an educated guess. Since the secondary node is part of the same system (like a cluster), maybe the attack is local. But I'm not sure. Let me check other metrics first.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The race condition is a timing issue. Typically, race conditions require low complexity because the attacker doesn't need to have complex steps. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have access to the secondary node. If the secondary node is part of the same system, maybe the attacker has local access. But if the secondary node is a remote node, then maybe the attacker needs to have network access. However, the description says \"private repository to be cloned,\" which implies that the attacker might need to have some access to the system. But if the vulnerability is in the secondary node's synchronization, maybe the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges. So PR:N. Wait, but if the attacker is exploiting a race condition in the secondary node, maybe they need to have some level of access. But the description doesn't mention needing specific privileges. So I'll go with PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The race condition is triggered automatically, so UI:N.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability affects different components. Since the secondary node is part of the same system, the scope is unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows cloning of a private repository. If the repository is private, then the attacker can access the data, so C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability allows cloning, but does it allow modification? The description doesn't mention integrity issues. So I:N.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability is about cloning, which might not directly affect availability. Unless the race condition causes some denial of service. But the description doesn't mention that. So A:N.\n\nWait, but the user might have to check if the race condition could lead to availability issues. However, the description only mentions cloning, which is about confidentiality. So I think C:H, others as N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Then the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But wait, the user's example had I:H and A:H. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me recheck.\n\nThe vulnerability is about cloning a private repository. Cloning would affect confidentiality (C:H) because the attacker can access the private data. But does it affect integrity? If the attacker can clone the repo, maybe they can modify it, but the description doesn't mention that. So I:N. Availability? If the race condition causes the system to crash or something, but the description doesn't say that. So A:N. So the vector would have C:H, others as N. But maybe the user expects different values. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because the secondary node is part of the same system. If the attacker is on the same network, maybe AV:N. But if the secondary node is a remote node, then AV:N. But if the attacker needs to be on the same system, then AV:L. The description says \"secondary node is out of sync.\" If the secondary node is a remote node, then the attack is network. But if it's a local node, then local. Since the description doesn't specify, but the secondary node is part of the same system (like a cluster), maybe AV:L. Wait, but the secondary node is part of the same system, so the attack is local. So AV:L. That would change the AV. Let me adjust that.\n\nSo if AV:L, then the vector would be AV:L. Let me check again. The problem is that the secondary node is out of sync. If the attacker is on the same system, they can trigger the race condition. So AV:L. But if the secondary node is a remote node, then AV:N. But the description doesn't specify. Since the secondary node is part of the same system (like a cluster), maybe AV:L. But I'm not sure. This is a bit ambiguous. However, in the absence of specific information, I think AV:N is more likely because the secondary node is part of the same network, and the attack could be triggered remotely. But I'm not certain. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example had AV:N, so maybe the user expects that. Alternatively, maybe the attack is local. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the attack is local because the secondary node is part of the same system. So AV:L. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the secondary node's synchronization. If the secondary node is a remote node, then the attacker would need to have network access. If it's a local node, then local. Since the description doesn't specify, but the secondary node is part of the same system (like a cluster), maybe AV:L. But I'm not sure. This is a bit of a judgment call. Let me proceed with AV:N, as the secondary node could be a remote node, and the attack is through the network. So AV:N.\n\nSo the final vector would be AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. But maybe the user expects different values. Let me check the example again. The example had C:H, I:H, A:H. But in this case, the vulnerability is about cloning a private repo, which is confidentiality. So C:H. Integrity and availability might not be affected. So I:N and A:N. So the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But I'm not sure if the user expects different values. Alternatively, maybe the attack could affect availability if the race condition causes the system to crash. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think the correct values are as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 1.5999999999999996, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a WordPress plugin vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the vulnerability is in a shortcode that's used in pages. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have contributor-level access, they can't exploit it from a remote network. So AV should be Local (L) because the attack requires the attacker to be on the same system or have local access. Wait, but the user is authenticated, so maybe it's Local? Or is it Adjacent? Hmm. Wait, the plugin is part of WordPress, so if the attacker is logged in, they can access the site. But the attack is via the shortcode, which is part of the site's content. So the attack vector is Local because the attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the site. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description mentions insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The attacker doesn't need to do anything complex; they can inject scripts directly. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low privilege level. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says the script executes when a user accesses the injected page. So the user has to visit the page, which implies some user interaction. Wait, but the attacker injects the script, and then the user has to click on the page. So UI is Required (R)? Or is it None? Wait, the user is the one accessing the page, so the attacker's script is executed when the user visits the page. So the user interaction is required. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but sometimes in CVSS, if the user has to click a link, that's considered user interaction. So UI:R.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts, which can affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Since the scope is unchanged (the attack doesn't change the scope of the vulnerability), S is Unchanged (U). Wait, the scope is about whether the attack affects a different component. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability to gain higher privileges or affect a different component, then scope is Changed (C). But in this case, the attack is on the same component (the plugin), so scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can inject scripts, which could steal data. So confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can modify the page content, so integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The attacker could potentially cause denial of service, but the description doesn't mention that. So availability is None (N) unless there's a way to disrupt availability. But the description doesn't specify that, so A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the user interaction is required. Let me check again. The attacker injects the script, and the user has to access the page for the script to execute. So the user interaction is required. So UI:R. But some might argue that the user interaction is not required because the attacker can inject the script, and the user just needs to view the page. But according to CVSS, if the user has to take some action (like clicking a link), then UI is Required. So UI:R.\n\nWait, but in some cases, if the script is automatically executed when the page is loaded, maybe UI is None. But the description says \"execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the user has to access the page, which implies that the user interaction is required. So UI:R.\n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the attack vector is Network (N) if the attacker can exploit it remotely. Wait, the attacker is authenticated, so they have to be on the same site. So AV is Local (L).

First, I need to parse the CVE description and map each metric. The description says the vulnerability is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) that can be launched remotely. \n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). Since the attack is remote, that's Network (N).

The user provided a CVE description about a WordPress plugin vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the plugin's shortcode, which is part of the WordPress site. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have contributor-level access, they can't just attack over the network. They have to be logged in and have access to the site. So AV should be Local (L) because the attack requires being on the same network or having local access to the system. Wait, but the description says \"authenticated attackers with contributor-level access\". So maybe it's Local? Or Adjacent? Hmm. Adjacent (A) is for attacks that require proximity, like a local network. But if the attacker is authenticated, maybe it's Local. Wait, the CVSS defines AV as Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), or Physical (P). Since the attacker is authenticated and can access the site, maybe it's Local. But I need to check. If the attacker is on the same network, maybe Adjacent. But the plugin is part of WordPress, so the attack is via the site's own interface. So the attack vector is Local because the attacker has to be logged in and have access to the site's backend. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says the vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The attacker doesn't need to do anything complex; they can inject scripts directly. So AC is Low (L) because the attack doesn't require complex steps.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low privilege level. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but the CVSS defines PR as None (N), Low (L), High (H). Contributor-level access is considered a low privilege requirement because it's not admin. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says the script executes when a user accesses the injected page. So the user has to visit the page, which implies that the attacker's payload is on a page that the user accesses. But does that require user interaction? The user has to click on the page, so maybe UI is Required (R). Wait, but the attack is that the attacker injects the script, and then the user accesses the page. So the user interaction is required for the exploit to work. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but sometimes in XSS, the user interaction is required. For example, if the attacker injects a script into a page, and then the user visits that page, the script runs. So UI is Required (R) because the user has to interact with the page. But I need to check the CVSS definitions. UI is None (N) if the attack can be executed without user interaction, or Required (R) if it requires user interaction. In this case, the user has to access the page, so UI is Required (R). So UI is R.\n\nScope (S): The scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new attack vector that affects a different component. But in this case, the vulnerability is in the plugin, and the attack affects the same component (the site's pages). So the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, the scope is about whether the attack can affect resources beyond the initial component. Since the attacker is injecting scripts into the site's pages, which are part of the same component (the WordPress site), the scope is Unchanged (U). So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts, which can read data from the user's session or other data. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can steal sensitive information. Wait, but the description says \"inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the attacker can execute code, which could lead to stealing cookies, session tokens, etc. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject scripts, which can modify data or manipulate the site's content. So integrity is High (H) because the attacker can alter data.\n\nAvailability (A): The attack doesn't directly affect availability. The script execution could potentially cause denial of service, but the description doesn't mention that. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: Low (L)\nUI: Required (R)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: High (H)\nI: High (H)\nA: None (N)\n\nWait, but I need to check again. For UI, if the user has to access the page, does that count as user interaction? The CVSS UI metric is about whether the user interaction is required for the attack to succeed. In this case, the attacker injects the script, and then the user has to access the page for the script to run. So the user interaction is required. So UI is R. But some might argue that the user interaction is not required because the attacker can inject the script, and the user's access is just the trigger. But according to CVSS, if the attack requires the user to take some action (like clicking a link), then UI is R. So I think UI is R here.\n\nSo the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but let me check again. The user is authenticated, so PR is Low.

The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in Photoshop Elements. The goal is to determine each base metric and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The metrics are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one based on the description.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability requires the victim to open a malicious file. Since the attack is initiated by the user opening a file, that's likely a Local (L) attack because the attacker needs to have access to the user's system. But wait, if the file is opened via a network, maybe it's Network (N)? Wait, the description says \"user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.\" So the attack vector is local because the user has to interact with the file, which is on their own system. So AV is Local (L). But wait, sometimes if the file is delivered via a network, like a malicious link, it might be Network. But the description doesn't specify that. It just says the user must open the file. So I think AV is Local (L) because the attack requires the user to interact with the file on their own system.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says exploitation requires user interaction. But the complexity here is whether the attack is complex. If the attacker needs to create a malicious file and get the user to open it, that's a low complexity because it's not requiring technical expertise beyond creating the file. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability allows privilege escalation. So the attacker can gain higher privileges. But the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. Since the user is already authenticated (they have to open the file), maybe PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior privileges. Wait, but the vulnerability allows escalation, so maybe the PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some privileges to exploit it. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated (like the user has to be logged in), then PR is Low (L). But if the attack can be done without any prior privileges, then it's None (N). The description says \"privilege escalation in the context of the current user.\" So the attacker is already in the context of the user, so maybe PR is None (N) because the user is already authenticated. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have some privileges to exploit it, like being logged in, then it's Low. But if the attack can be done without any prior privileges, then it's None. Since the user has to open the file, which implies they are already authenticated, but the vulnerability allows escalation. So maybe PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some level of access (like being a user) to exploit it. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without any prior privileges, then it's None. But in this case, the user has to open the file, which is part of the attack. So maybe the attacker doesn't need any prior privileges, just the user's interaction. So PR is None (N). I'm a bit torn here, but I think PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to have any specific privileges beyond the user's existing access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says \"Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.\" So UI is Required (R) because the user has to take an action (open the file) for the attack to happen.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain privileges beyond the initial access. Since the vulnerability is a privilege escalation, the scope is Changed (C) because the attack can lead to a different privilege level (escalation).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The description says the vulnerability could result in privilege escalation. Privilege escalation affects Integrity (I) because the attacker can modify system settings or data. But wait, privilege escalation is more about gaining higher privileges, which affects Integrity (I) because the attacker can alter system configurations. However, the description doesn't mention data confidentiality or availability. So for C, it's None (N) because there's no mention of data being disclosed. For I, since the attacker can escalate privileges, which allows them to modify the system, so I is High (H). For A, there's no mention of availability being affected, so A is None (N). Wait, but maybe the privilege escalation could lead to denial of service? The description doesn't specify, so I think A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) - because the attack requires user interaction with the file on their system.\nAC: Low (L) - the attack is not complex, just requires the user to open the file.\nPR: None (N) - the attacker doesn't need prior privileges, just the user's interaction.\nUI: Required (R) - the user must open the malicious file.\nS: Changed (C) - the attack allows privilege escalation, changing the scope.\nC: None (N) - no mention of data confidentiality.\nI: High (H) - privilege escalation affects system integrity.\nA: None (N) - no mention of availability impact.\n\nWait, but the description says \"privilege escalation in the context of the current user.\" So the attacker can gain higher privileges, which would affect Integrity (I) because they can modify the system. So I is High (H). But what about C? If the attacker can access the user's data, but the description doesn't mention that. So C is None (N). A is None (N) as well.\n\nSo the vector would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but the user interaction is required (R), so UI is R. Scope is Changed (C). So the final vector is as above. Let me check again.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

A lack of input validation in the Kubernetes integration could allow an authenticated user to cause denial of service..\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description, and I need to figure out each of the base metrics. Let me start by reading the CVE description carefully.\n\nThe issue is in GitLab CE/EE versions mentioned. The problem is a lack of input validation in the Kubernetes integration, allowing an authenticated user to cause a denial of service. So, the main points here are that the vulnerability is in the Kubernetes integration, and it's exploitable by an authenticated user leading to DoS.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The description says the user is authenticated. So, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the user needs to be authenticated. Wait, but sometimes if the attack is through a network, even if authenticated, maybe it's Network. Wait, but the user is authenticated, so maybe it's Local. Wait, but the attack vector depends on how the exploit is done. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that might imply that the attack is via the local network, but maybe it's through a network connection. Hmm. Wait, the attack vector is about how the attack is delivered. If the user is authenticated, maybe the attack is via the network, but the user has to be authenticated. Wait, the attack vector options are Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), Physical (P). \n\nIn this case, the user is authenticated, so the attack is likely through the network, but the user has to be authenticated. Wait, but the attack vector is about the path to exploit. If the attacker is authenticated, maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because the user is already authenticated. Wait, but maybe the attack is via the network. For example, if the attacker is on the same network, but that's Adjacent. But the description doesn't specify. However, the fact that the user is authenticated might imply that the attack is via the network, but the user has to be authenticated. Wait, but the attack vector is about the method of attack. If the attacker is authenticated, maybe the attack is Local (L) because the user is already logged in. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. \n\nIn CVSS, Attack Vector (AV) is the path by which the attack is delivered. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that might not directly affect the AV. For example, if the attack is via the network, even if the user is authenticated, the AV would be Network (N). But if the attack requires the attacker to be on the same system, then it's Local (L). However, the description says \"authenticated user\", which suggests that the attack is via the network, but the user has to be authenticated. Wait, but maybe the attack is local. For example, if the user is already logged in, then the attack is local. But the problem is that the user is authenticated, so the attack vector could be Local (L) because the attacker is already authenticated. But I'm not sure. Let me check some examples. For example, if a vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated, the AV is usually Local (L) because the attacker is already on the system. But if the attack is through a network connection, even with authentication, it's Network (N). Hmm. \n\nWait, the attack vector is about the path. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability through the network, then AV is Network. If the attacker needs to be on the same system, then Local. But the description doesn't specify. However, the fact that the user is authenticated might imply that the attack is via the network, but the user has to be authenticated. Wait, but maybe the attack is local. For example, if the user is logged in, they can exploit the vulnerability. So, the attack vector would be Local (L). But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. \n\nIn the case of a DoS attack that requires the user to be authenticated, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker is already authenticated. So, AV: Local (L). \n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says \"lack of input validation\" which might imply that the attack is simple, so Attack Complexity is Low (L). Because the attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps, just provide invalid input. So AC: Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user is authenticated, so the attacker needs to have some level of privileges. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already authenticated, then PR is Low (L) because the attacker has already logged in. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, then PR is Low (L) because the attacker has to have some level of access. Wait, the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a low privilege requirement. So PR: Low (L). \n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The attack is triggered by the authenticated user, so UI is None (N). \n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability affects the same security scope. Since the DoS is a denial of service, which affects availability, but the scope is unchanged if the attack doesn't change the scope. Wait, the scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new security impact beyond the original component. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, then scope is changed. But in this case, the DoS is within the same component, so the scope is Unchanged (U). \n\nConfidentiality (C): The DoS doesn't affect confidentiality, so C is None (N). \n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the DoS doesn't affect integrity, so I is None (N). \n\nAvailability (A): The DoS directly affects availability, so A is High (H). \n\nWait, but let me check again. The DoS is caused by the authenticated user, so the availability is impacted. So A is High (H). \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) because the attacker is authenticated and can exploit the vulnerability locally. \n\nAC: Low (L) because the attack is simple. \n\nPR: Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated. \n\nUI: None (N) because no user interaction is required. \n\nS: Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope. \n\nC: None (N) \n\nI: None (N) \n\nA: High (H) \n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure about AV. Let me think again. If the attack is via the network, even if the user is authenticated, then AV would be Network (N). But the description says \"authenticated user\", which might imply that the attack is via the network. For example, if the user is authenticated via a network connection, then the attack vector is Network. But if the user is already logged in, then it's Local. \n\nHmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. \n\nIn CVSS v3.1, Attack Vector (AV) is the path by which the attack is delivered. If the attack requires the attacker to be authenticated, that's not directly part of the AV. For example, if the attack is via the network, then AV is Network (N). If the attack is via a local system, then AV is Local (L). \n\nIn this case, the vulnerability is in the Kubernetes integration. If the attacker is authenticated, they can exploit it. So, the attack is via the network, but the user is authenticated. Wait, but the attack vector is about the method of attack. If the attacker is on the same network, then it's Adjacent (A). If the attacker is on the same system, then Local (L). \n\nBut the description doesn't specify. However, the fact that the user is authenticated might imply that the attack is via the network. For example, if the user is authenticated via a web interface, then the attack is via the network. So AV would be Network (N). \n\nWait, but the user is authenticated, which might mean that the attack is via the network. So AV: Network (N). \n\nBut earlier I thought it's Local. This is conflicting. \n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose a vulnerability in a web application that requires the attacker to be authenticated. The attack vector would be Network (N) because the attacker is accessing the web application over the network. So AV: Network (N). \n\nIn that case, the AV would be Network (N). \n\nSo, in this case, the attack is via the network, so AV: Network (N). \n\nSo, that changes the AV. \n\nSo, AV: Network (N). \n\nThen, the other metrics: \n\nAC: Low (L) because the attack is simple. \n\nPR: None (N) because the attacker is already authenticated. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is authenticated, that's a low privilege requirement. Wait, the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). \n\nWait, the PR metric is about the level of privileges the attacker needs to have before exploiting the vulnerability. If the attacker is already authenticated, that's a low privilege requirement. So PR: Low (L). \n\nWait, but maybe the PR is None (N) because", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in IBM Maximo MXAPIASSET API 7.6.1.3 where a remote attacker can traverse directories by sending a crafted URL with \"../\" sequences to access arbitrary files.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to exploit it over the network. The attacker doesn't need to be physically present or have local access. So AV should be Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description mentions a specially crafted URL. The attacker needs to know the specific URL structure, but since it's a directory traversal, the complexity might be low because it's a single request. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any prior privileges. They can exploit this from a remote location without authentication. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attacker sends a request, and the system processes it. There's no mention of needing user interaction, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Since the attacker can read files, which is confidentiality, but the scope here is whether the impact is on the same component or a different one. Since the attack is on the same component (the API), the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can read arbitrary files, which is a high confidentiality impact. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The description doesn't mention any modification of files or data. The attacker can't alter files, so I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't mention any denial of service or resource exhaustion. So A is None (N).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. The attack is directory traversal, which allows reading files. So confidentiality is high. But what about integrity? If the attacker can read files, but not modify them, then integrity is not affected. Availability? If the attacker can't cause the system to crash or deny service, then A is none. So the metrics would be C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Then the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Wait, but sometimes directory traversal can lead to other issues. Let me check again. The problem is that the attacker can access arbitrary files, which is a confidentiality issue. So C is High. But what about integrity? If the attacker can't modify files, then I is None. Availability? If the attack doesn't affect availability, then A is None. So the final vector is as above. But I need to make sure that the scope is correct. Since the attack is on the same component (the API), the scope is Unchanged. So S:U. That's correct.

The vulnerability arises from improper sanitization of HTML tags in chat history uploads. Specifically, the sanitization logic fails to handle HTML tags within code blocks correctly, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to identity theft or other malicious actions.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a stored XSS in the gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt repository, affecting version git 20b2e02. The issue is due to improper sanitization of HTML tags in chat history uploads. Specifically, the sanitization fails to handle HTML tags within code blocks, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts. This leads to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser, risking identity theft or other malicious actions.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is a stored XSS. Stored XSS typically allows an attacker to inject code that is stored on the server and then delivered to other users when they visit the affected page. Since the attacker can inject the script into the chat history, which is then served to other users, the attack vector here is likely Network (N) because the attacker can exploit this remotely over the network. Wait, but stored XSS can be considered as Local (L) if the attacker needs to be authenticated to upload the malicious content. However, the description doesn't specify if the attacker needs to be authenticated. But since it's a stored XSS, the attacker might need to be authenticated to upload the malicious script. However, in many cases, stored XSS is considered as Network (N) because the attack can be delivered to other users without them needing to be authenticated. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again. If the attacker can inject the script into the chat history, which is then served to other users, then the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can exploit this remotely. But if the attacker needs to be authenticated to upload the script, then it's Local (L). The description says \"improper sanitization of HTML tags in chat history uploads.\" So the attacker would need to be able to upload the malicious content, which might require being authenticated. However, the CVSS guidelines for stored XSS typically consider the attack vector as Network (N) because the payload is stored and delivered to other users. So I think AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any special steps beyond injecting the malicious script. The sanitization fails to handle HTML tags in code blocks, so the attack is straightforward. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have the ability to upload the chat history, which might require some level of authentication. However, if the attacker is already authenticated, then PR is Low (L). If the attacker can exploit this without authentication, then it's None (N). The description doesn't specify if the attacker needs to be authenticated. But since it's a stored XSS, it's possible that the attacker needs to be authenticated to upload the malicious content. However, in some cases, stored XSS can be exploited without authentication if the attacker can inject the payload into a public area. But the description says \"chat history uploads,\" which might imply that the attacker needs to be authenticated to upload. However, the CVSS guidelines for stored XSS typically consider PR as None (N) if the attacker can exploit it without needing to be authenticated. Wait, but if the attacker needs to be authenticated to upload the payload, then PR would be Low (L). This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check. The CVSS v3.1 defines PR as the level of privileges required for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated to upload the payload, then PR is Low (L). If the attacker can exploit it without authentication, then PR is None (N). Since the description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is in the chat history uploads, which might require the attacker to be authenticated to upload the content. However, in some cases, even if the attacker is authenticated, the vulnerability could be exploited without needing additional privileges. So I think PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated to upload the malicious script. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the attacker can exploit it without needing to be authenticated if the chat history is publicly accessible. Hmm. This is a point of confusion. Let me think again. If the attacker can inject the script into the chat history, which is then served to other users, then the attacker might not need to be authenticated to exploit it. Wait, no. The attacker would need to be authenticated to upload the malicious content. So PR would be Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some level of access (like being authenticated) to exploit the vulnerability. Therefore, PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts that execute in the user's browser. However, the user doesn't need to interact with the malicious content for the attack to occur. The script is executed automatically when the user visits the affected page. Therefore, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope refers to whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to elevate privileges. Since the vulnerability is a stored XSS, the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't allow the attacker to gain higher privileges than the user. The attacker can execute scripts in the context of the user's browser, but they can't elevate their own privileges beyond that. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can steal user data, such as identity theft. This affects confidentiality. The impact is High (H) because the attacker can access sensitive information.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can modify data, but the description mentions that the vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript, which could lead to identity theft. However, the integrity impact here is not directly mentioned. Wait, the attacker can inject scripts, which might allow them to alter data, but the main impact here is confidentiality. However, if the attacker can modify the chat history, that would affect integrity. But the description says the vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript, which could lead to identity theft. So maybe the integrity is not directly affected. Wait, the CVSS metrics are about the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The stored XSS allows the attacker to execute code, which can lead to stealing data (confidentiality), but not necessarily modifying data (integrity). However, if the attacker can inject scripts that alter the content, then integrity would be affected. But the description doesn't mention that. It says the attacker can inject malicious scripts, which can lead to identity theft. So the main impact is on confidentiality. Therefore, I is None (N) or Low (L)? Wait, the CVSS v3.1 defines I as the impact on integrity. If the attacker can modify data, then I is High (H). But the description doesn't mention that. It's about executing code, which is more about confidentiality. So maybe I is None (N). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the attacker can inject scripts that alter the content, then I would be High. But the description doesn't specify that. So perhaps the integrity impact is None (N) because the main impact is on confidentiality. However, the CVSS guidelines for XSS typically consider that the attacker can modify data, so I might be High (H). Wait, but the description says the attacker can inject malicious scripts, which can lead to identity theft. That's more about confidentiality. So maybe I is None (N). Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check. The CVSS v3.1 for XSS typically has C as High (H) because the attacker can steal data, and I as None (N) because the attacker can't modify data unless specified. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the attacker can inject scripts that alter the content, then I would be High. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think I is None (N) here.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't directly affect availability. The attacker can't cause denial of service or disrupt the service. So A is None (N).\n\nWait, but let me recheck. The description says the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript, which could lead to identity theft or other malicious actions. Identity theft is a confidentiality issue. Availability is about the system's availability. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Network (N)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: Low (L)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: High (H)\nI: None (N)\nA: None (N)\n\nWait, but earlier I thought PR might be None (N) if the attacker doesn't need to be authenticated. But if the attacker needs to be authenticated to upload the malicious content, then PR is Low (L). The description says \"chat history uploads,\" which might require the attacker to be authenticated. So PR is Low (L). \n\nBut if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing to be authenticated, then PR is None (N). However, the description doesn't specify. But in many cases, stored XSS requires the attacker to be authenticated to upload the payload. So PR is Low (L).\n\nSo the vector would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n\nBut wait, the user interaction is None (N), which is correct.

First, I need to understand the CVE description. The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the MME of Magma up to version 1.8.0. The attack vector is network-adjacent, meaning the attacker is on the same network. The exploit involves sending an S1AP packet missing the ENB_UE_S1AP_ID field, causing the MME to crash.\n\nStarting with the base metrics. Attack Vector (AV) is Network (N) because the attacker is network-adjacent. Wait, the options are Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), Physical (P). The description says \"network-adjacent attackers\", so that's Adjacent (A)? Wait, no. Wait, the term \"network-adjacent\" might be a bit ambiguous. Let me check the CVSS definitions. Attack Vector (AV) is the path by which the attack is delivered. If the attacker is on the same network, that's Network (N). But if they are adjacent, like on the same local network, maybe that's considered Network. Wait, the options for AV are N (Network), A (Adjacent), L (Local), P (Physical). So if the attacker is on the same network, like a remote network, then AV is N. But if they are adjacent, like on the same local network, maybe that's considered Adjacent (A). Wait, the CVE says \"network-adjacent attackers\", which might mean they are on the same network as the target. So maybe AV is Network (N). But I need to be careful here. Let me think again. The S1AP packet is part of the network communication, so the attacker is sending packets over the network. So the attack vector is Network (N). But the term \"network-adjacent\" might imply that the attacker is adjacent to the network, like a local network, which could be considered Adjacent (A). Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Let me check the CVSS documentation. According to CVSS v3.1, Attack Vector (AV) is the method by which the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attack requires the attacker to be on the same network, then AV is Network (N). If the attacker is adjacent, like on the same local network, that's still considered Network (N). Wait, no. Wait, Adjacent (A) is for attacks that require the attacker to be physically adjacent to the target, like a local network. Wait, no. Let me check the exact definitions. From the CVSS v3.1 documentation: AV: Network (N) - The attack is delivered over a network. Adjacent (A) - The attack requires the attacker to be adjacent to the target. Local (L) - The attack requires the attacker to have local access. Physical (P) - The attack requires physical access. So if the attacker is on the same network, that's Network (N). If they are adjacent, like on the same local network, but not directly connected, maybe that's Adjacent (A). Wait, but the S1AP is a protocol used in the network, so the attacker is sending packets over the network. So the attack vector is Network (N). But the description says \"network-adjacent attackers\", which might mean they are on the same network as the target. So AV is Network (N). But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The S1AP is part of the network communication, so the attacker is sending packets over the network. Therefore, AV is Network (N). So I'll go with AV:N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference. The attacker needs to send a specific packet missing a field. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to have any special privileges or complex steps. They just need to send a malformed packet. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any privileges. They can exploit the vulnerability without any prior access. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack doesn't require any user interaction. The attacker sends the packet, and the MME crashes. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows the attacker to crash the MME, which is a denial of service. The scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope. The impact is on the same component (MME), so the scope remains unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows the MME to crash, which could lead to denial of service, but there's no mention of data being disclosed. So Confidentiality is None (N). Wait, but if the MME crashes, maybe it could lead to data exposure if the crash is exploited further. However, the description doesn't mention that. So I think C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the attack causes a crash, but there's no mention of data being modified. So Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The crash would affect the availability of the MME, leading to denial of service. So Availability is High (H).\n\nWait, but the description says the attacker can crash the MME. So the availability impact is High (H). So the final vector would be AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. But wait, the user might have to check if the crash leads to a denial of service. Since the MME is a critical component, crashing it would definitely impact availability. So A is High (H).\n\nBut let me check again. The CVSS metrics: C, I, A are the impact metrics. For this vulnerability, the impact is on availability. So A is High (H). The other impact metrics (C and I) are None (N) because there's no data disclosure or modification. So the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the initial analysis said that the attack is network-adjacent. Wait, earlier I thought AV:N, but maybe it's Adjacent (A). Let me re-examine the attack vector. The attacker is network-adjacent, which might mean they are on the same network as the target. In that case, AV is Network (N). But if the attacker is adjacent to the network, like on the same local network, but not directly connected, then AV is Adjacent (A). However, the S1AP is a network protocol, so the attack is delivered over the network. Therefore, AV:N is correct. So the final vector is as above. But I need to make sure. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example answer is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. But that's just an example. So for this case, the answer would be AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. But wait, the user might have to consider if the crash could lead to other impacts. However, the description doesn't mention any data exposure or modification. So the answer should be as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\n**Metric Justifications:**\n- **AV:N** (Network): The attacker exploits the vulnerability via network communication (S1AP packets), requiring no physical or local access.  \n- **AC:L** (Low): The attack requires only a single step (sending a malformed packet) with no additional complexity.  \n- **PR:N** (None): No privileges are needed; the attack can be performed by any network-adjacent attacker.  \n- **UI:N** (None): No user interaction is required; the attack is fully automated.  \n- **S:U** (Unchanged): The vulnerability affects the same component (MME) without changing the scope.  \n- **C:N** (None): No confidentiality impact; the crash does not disclose sensitive data.  \n- **I:N** (None): No integrity impact; the crash does not alter data.  \n- **A:H** (High): The crash directly impacts availability by causing the MME to fail, disrupting service.", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.0, "success": true}

This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IBM CICS. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, let's recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The ones mentioned are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is stored XSS in the Web UI. Stored XSS typically means the attacker can inject code that's stored on the server and then delivered to other users when they visit the site. Since the Web UI is involved, the attack vector is likely Network (N) because the attacker can exploit this through the network, like via a web browser. But wait, stored XSS is usually considered as Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the system where the code is stored. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Wait, the description says \"users can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI\". So the attack is through the web interface, which is a network-based attack. So AV:N makes sense here because the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network, not needing physical access or local access. So AV:N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). For XSS, the complexity is usually Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need special tools or knowledge beyond injecting the script. The attack can be done by simply embedding the code, so AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability allows users to embed code, so the attacker doesn't need any special privileges. PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says \"altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session\". For XSS, user interaction is often required. The user has to click on the malicious link or view the compromised page. So UI:R. Wait, but some XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited without user interaction if the code is automatically executed. However, in stored XSS, the user typically has to interact with the malicious content. So UI:R. But I need to check. If the attacker injects the script into a page that other users view, then the user interaction is required for the attack to work. So UI:R. But some sources might say that if the attacker can inject the script and it's executed automatically, maybe UI:N. Wait, the CVE description says \"users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI\". So the attacker is embedding the code, which is then delivered to other users. So the user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. Therefore, UI:R.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the Web UI, and the attack affects the same component (the web application), the scope is Unchanged (U). So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows credentials disclosure. So confidentiality is compromised. High (H) because it's about sensitive data like credentials. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can alter the intended functionality. That's about modifying data or system behavior. So integrity is compromised. High (H) because the attacker can change the functionality, which could lead to data tampering. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A). The description doesn't mention any impact on availability. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but I need to check if UI is required. Let me think again. If the attacker injects the script into the Web UI, and then other users visit that page, the script is executed when they view it. So the user interaction is required for the attack to work. Therefore, UI:R. But some might argue that if the attacker can inject the script and it's executed automatically without user interaction, then UI:N. However, in stored XSS, the user has to interact with the malicious content. So UI:R is correct here.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Let me check if that's correct. The answer should start with Answer: and the vector string.

The user provided a CVE description about a WordPress plugin vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the attack vector (AV). The vulnerability is a CSRF, which typically requires the attacker to trick the user into clicking a link. Since the attacker can't directly access the system without the user's interaction, the attack vector is likely Network (N) because the request is made over the network. Wait, but CSRF is usually considered as requiring user interaction. Hmm, maybe I need to check the CVSS guidelines. Oh right, for CSRF, the attack vector is usually Network (N) because the attacker can send a request via a link or form, which the user clicks. So AV:N.\n\nAttack complexity (AC). The description says the attacker needs to trick the admin into clicking a link. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need any special setup; just a forged request. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges required (PR). The attacker is unauthenticated, so they don't need any privileges. PR:N.\n\nUser interaction (UI). Since the attack requires the user (admin) to click a link, UI:R. Wait, but the user is the one being tricked. So the user interaction is required. So UI:R.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability allows deleting arbitrary results, which affects the same component (the plugin's functionality). So the scope is unchanged (U). Wait, but if the attack can affect other components, maybe it's changed. But the description says it's about deleting results, which is part of the same component. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows deletion, which doesn't directly affect confidentiality. So C:N.\n\nIntegrity (I). Deleting results affects the integrity of the data. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A). The attack doesn't directly impact availability. So A:N.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check again. The attack allows deleting arbitrary results. So that's a high integrity impact because the data is being modified. So I:H. Availability isn't directly affected, so A:N. Confidentiality isn't affected, so C:N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:N, I:H, A:N. Then the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. Wait, but the user's example had UI:N. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the user interaction. The attack requires the user to click a link, so UI:R. But in some cases, if the user is tricked into clicking, does that count as user interaction? Yes, because the user has to take an action. So UI:R is correct. But I need to confirm. According to CVSS, UI:R means user interaction is required. So yes, in this case, the user has to click the link, so UI:R. So the vector would have UI:R. But maybe the original example had UI:N. Wait, the example given by the user in the final line was UI:N. But that's just an example. The actual answer depends on the scenario. Let me check the CVE description again. The attacker can trick a site administrator into performing an action like clicking a link. So the user (admin) must interact. Therefore, UI:R. So the vector would have UI:R. But I need to make sure. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. For UI, if the attack requires the user to take some action, then UI:R. So in this case, the user has to click the link, so UI:R. Therefore, the correct vector would have UI:R. \n\nSo the final vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. But wait, the example in the problem had UI:N. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The attack is CSRF, which typically requires user interaction. So UI:R.

The user provided a CVE description about a Linux kernel vulnerability in the drm/msm/dpu module. The issue is a NULL pointer dereference when printing the state without a corresponding atomic_check, which assigns pipe->sspp.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the kernel, so an attacker would need to be local to exploit it. But wait, the description mentions that the state is dumped without atomic_check, which might be a local exploit. However, if the attacker can trigger this via a local process, AV would be Local (L). But maybe the vulnerability could be exploited remotely if the kernel is exposed to network attacks. Wait, the patch is about a NULL pointer dereference in a function that's called during state printing. That's likely a local exploit because the attacker would need to have access to the system to trigger the state dump. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The patch adds a check to prevent the NULL dereference. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any special steps beyond triggering the state dump. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker would need to have local access, but the patch is about a NULL pointer, which might not require elevated privileges. However, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so maybe the attacker needs to be a local user. But the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit. If the attacker is already local, maybe PR is None (N) because the exploit doesn't require additional privileges beyond what's already there. Wait, but if the attacker is a local user, they might not need any special privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered by the state dump, which might be part of a system process. If the user doesn't need to interact, then UI is None (N). But if the attacker needs to have the user perform an action, like triggering a specific command, then UI would be Required (R). However, the description doesn't mention user interaction, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the exploit could lead to system-wide issues, but the scope here is unchanged because the attack doesn't change the scope. Wait, the scope is Changed (C) if the attack affects a different component. But in this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit would affect the same component (kernel), so Scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which could lead to a crash, but not directly leaking data. However, if the crash leads to information disclosure, then C would be High. But the description doesn't mention data exposure. So C is None (N). Wait, but maybe the crash could be exploited to cause a denial of service, which affects availability. Wait, the question is about the base metrics. Let me check again. The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which could lead to a crash. But for confidentiality, if the crash doesn't expose any data, then C is None. However, sometimes a NULL pointer dereference could be a way to trigger a crash, which might not directly affect confidentiality. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the vulnerability might not directly affect the integrity of the system. If the crash doesn't allow modification of data, then I is None (N). But if the crash could be exploited to modify data, then I would be High. However, the description doesn't mention that. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The NULL pointer dereference could lead to a crash, which would affect availability. So A is High (H).

The verification token used for sending SMS through a goTenna server is hardcoded in the app.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a hardcoded verification token in the goTenna app. I need to figure out each of the base metrics.\n\nFirst, Attack Vector (AV). The token is hardcoded in the app, so an attacker would need to access the app's code or data. Since the app is on the device, maybe it's local? But wait, if the app is on the device, an attacker could access it locally. But if the app is running on a device that's connected to the internet, maybe the token is exposed through network traffic? Hmm. Wait, the token is used for sending SMS through a server. So if the app is on the device, the token is stored there. If an attacker can access the device, they can get the token. But if the app is on a device that's connected to the internet, maybe the token is sent over the network. But the problem is that the token is hardcoded, so maybe it's accessible via local access. So AV would be Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the device's storage or code. But wait, if the token is sent over the network, then AV could be Network (N). Wait, the token is used for sending SMS through a server. So when the app sends SMS, it uses the token. If the token is hardcoded, then if an attacker can intercept the network traffic, they could capture the token. But the token is hardcoded, so maybe it's not transmitted over the network. Wait, the token is used for authentication with the server. So when the app sends an SMS, it sends the token to the server. If the token is hardcoded, then the app sends it over the network. So an attacker could capture that token via network traffic. Therefore, the attack vector would be Network (N) because the token is sent over the network. But wait, the token is hardcoded in the app, so maybe it's stored in the app's code. If the app is on the device, an attacker could access the device's storage and extract the token. So that's a local attack. But if the token is sent over the network, then it's a network attack. Which is more likely? The description says the token is hardcoded in the app. So if the app is on the device, the token is stored there. So an attacker would need to access the device (local access) to get the token. But if the app is sending the token over the network, then the token is exposed via network. So which is the case? The problem is that the token is used for sending SMS through the server. So when the app sends an SMS, it sends the token to the server. Therefore, the token is transmitted over the network. So the attack vector would be Network (N) because the attacker can intercept the network traffic. But if the token is hardcoded, maybe the attacker can get it from the app's code. But if the app is on the device, then the attacker needs to have access to the device (local access) to get the token. So which is the correct AV? Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The token is hardcoded in the app. So if the app is on the device, the token is stored in the app's code. So an attacker would need to access the device (local access) to get the token. But if the app is sending the token over the network, then the token is exposed via network. So the attack vector could be either. But the CVSS defines AV as the primary method of attack. If the token is sent over the network, then AV is Network. If the token is stored locally, then AV is Local. But the problem is that the token is used for sending SMS through the server. So the token is sent over the network. Therefore, the attack vector is Network (N). Wait, but the token is hardcoded in the app. So the app uses the token to authenticate with the server. So when the app sends an SMS, it sends the token to the server. Therefore, the token is transmitted over the network. So an attacker could capture that token via network traffic. Therefore, AV is Network (N). But if the attacker can access the device, they can get the token from the app's code. So in that case, AV is Local (L). But which is more likely? The CVSS considers the attack vector as the primary method. If the token is sent over the network, then the attack vector is Network. But if the token is stored in the app's code, then the attack vector is Local. But the problem is that the token is used for sending SMS through the server. So the token is sent over the network. Therefore, the attack vector is Network (N). So AV is N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The token is hardcoded, so the attacker doesn't need to do anything complex. They can just read the token from the app's code or intercept the network traffic. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any privileges. They can access the token without needing to be authenticated. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attacker doesn't need user interaction. They can exploit the vulnerability without any user action. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability affects the same component (the app's token) and doesn't allow elevation of privilege. The token is used for sending SMS, so the scope doesn't change. So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The token is used for authentication. If an attacker gets the token, they can impersonate the user and send SMS. So confidentiality is High (H) because the token is a secret that, if exposed, allows unauthorized access to the service.\n\nIntegrity (I): The token is used for authentication, not for modifying data. So integrity is None (N) because the token doesn't affect the integrity of the system.\n\nAvailability (A): The token doesn't affect availability. So A is None (N).\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check again. The token is used for sending SMS. If an attacker gets the token, they can send SMS on behalf of the user. So that's a confidentiality issue because the token is a secret. But maybe it's also an integrity issue if the token is used to sign messages. Wait, the description says it's a verification token used for sending SMS. So the token is used to authenticate the sender. If an attacker gets the token, they can send SMS as the user. So that's a confidentiality issue because the token is a secret. But maybe it's also an integrity issue if the token is used to sign the SMS. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think C is High (H) because the token is a secret that allows unauthorized access. I and A are None (N) because the token doesn't affect the integrity or availability of the system.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nSo the vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake with I and A. Let me think again. If the token is used for authentication, then the attacker can impersonate the user, which affects confidentiality (since the attacker can access the user's data or send messages as them). But integrity is about the ability to modify data. If the token is used for authentication, but not for signing data, then integrity is not affected. So I is N. Availability is not affected, so A is N. So the previous conclusion holds.\n\nAnother point: the scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to gain higher privileges. The token is used for sending SMS, so the scope doesn't change. So S:U is correct.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 1.3000000000000007, "success": true}

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JP2 files.The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25564.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description, and I need to figure out each of the base metrics. Let me start by recalling the CVSS v3.1 base metrics and their definitions.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose information. Since the attacker can exploit this remotely, AV should be Network (N). But wait, the user interaction is required. Wait, the user interaction is required for exploitation, but the attack vector is still network because the attacker can send a malicious file or page over the network. So AV is Network.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions that the flaw is due to not validating an object before using it. The attacker needs to have the target visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The complexity here might be high because the attacker has to get the user to interact with the malicious content. But wait, the attack complexity is about how hard it is for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have the user open a file, that might be considered high complexity because it requires the user to take an action. But sometimes, if the attack is possible without much effort, it's low. Hmm. The description says \"user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability\", which might imply that the attack complexity is high because the attacker has to get the user to perform an action. So AC is High (H).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The description says the attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code. But the base metric here is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. Since the vulnerability is a use-after-free, which is a memory corruption issue, typically, the attacker doesn't need any privileges beyond what the user has. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description explicitly states that user interaction is required. So UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The description says the issue results in information disclosure, and the attacker can leverage it with other vulnerabilities to execute code. Since the scope is changed if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges or affect a different component. But the base metric here is about the scope of the impact. If the vulnerability can be used to execute code, that's a change in scope. However, the base metric for scope is whether the impact is on the same component or a different one. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to execute code, that's a change in scope. But the original impact is information disclosure. So the scope is Changed (C) because the attacker can escalate to execute code, which is a different component. Wait, but the base metrics are about the base impact. Wait, the scope is whether the impact is on the same component or a different one. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges (like executing code), that's a change in scope. So S is Changed (C).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows disclosure of sensitive information. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The description mentions that the attacker can leverage this with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code. So if the attacker can execute code, that affects integrity. But the base metric here is about the initial impact. The original issue is information disclosure, but the attacker can use it with other vulnerabilities to execute code. However, the base metric for integrity is whether the vulnerability allows modification of data. Since the initial impact is information disclosure, but the attacker can use it to execute code, which would affect integrity. Wait, but the base metrics are about the direct impact of the vulnerability. The original issue is information disclosure, so I would think that the integrity is not directly affected. But the description says the attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code. However, the base metric for integrity is about the impact of the vulnerability itself, not the potential for escalation. So maybe the initial impact on integrity is None (N), but the scope is changed because the attacker can escalate. Wait, this is confusing. Let me check the CVSS definitions again.\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. If the vulnerability can be used to execute code, that's a different component (like the process itself), so scope is Changed (C). But the base metrics for C, I, A are the impact of the vulnerability itself. So if the vulnerability allows information disclosure, then C is High. If the attacker can execute code, that's a different impact, but the base metric is about the direct impact. So the original issue is information disclosure, so C is High. The integrity (I) would be None (N) unless the vulnerability allows modification of data. The description doesn't mention that, so I is None. Availability (A) is also None unless the vulnerability affects availability. The description says the attacker can execute code, which could affect availability, but the base metric is about the direct impact. Since the original issue is information disclosure, A is None. However, the attacker can use it with other vulnerabilities to execute code, which might affect availability. But the base metric is about the direct impact. So maybe A is None. Wait, but the description says \"execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\" That would affect integrity (since code execution is a modification of the system's state) and availability (if the code execution leads to denial of service). But the base metrics are about the direct impact. So if the vulnerability itself allows code execution, then I would be High. But the original description says the specific flaw is in the parsing of JP2 files, leading to information disclosure. The attacker can leverage this with other vulnerabilities to execute code. So the base metric for the vulnerability itself is information disclosure (C: High), and the other vulnerabilities are not part of the base metric. Therefore, the base metrics for C is High, I is None, A is None. But wait, the attacker can use this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities. However, the base metric is about the vulnerability itself. So the base metrics are based on the direct impact of the vulnerability, not the potential for escalation. Therefore, the base metrics would be C: High (information disclosure), I: None, A: None. But the description says the attacker can execute code, which would be a different impact. However, the base metric is about the direct impact. So maybe the base metrics are C: High, I: None, A: None. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the vulnerability allows code execution, then I would be High. But the description says the attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities. So the base metric is about the vulnerability itself, not the combination. Therefore, the base metrics for C is High, I is None, A is None. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS definitions again.\n\nThe CVSS v3.1 base metrics are:\n\n- Attack Vector (AV)\n- Attack Complexity (AC)\n- Privileges Required (PR)\n- User Interaction (UI)\n- Scope (S)\n- Confidentiality (C)\n- Integrity (I)\n- Availability (A)\n\nThe scope (S) is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. If the vulnerability can be used to execute code, that's a different component (the process itself), so S is Changed (C). But the base metrics for C, I, A are the impact of the vulnerability itself. So if the vulnerability allows information disclosure, then C is High. If the attacker can execute code, that's a different impact, but the base metric is about the direct impact. So the base metrics would be C: High, I: None, A: None. However, the description says the attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code. But the base metric is about the vulnerability itself. So the base metrics for C, I, A are based on the direct impact of the vulnerability. Therefore, the original issue is information disclosure, so C is High. The other impacts (I and A) are not directly caused by the vulnerability itself. Therefore, I and A are None. But wait, the attacker can execute code, which would be a different impact. However, the base metric is about the direct impact. So the base metrics are C: High, I: None, A: None. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the vulnerability allows code execution, then I would be High. But the description says the attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities. So the base metric is about the vulnerability itself, not the combination. Therefore, the base metrics for C is High, I and A are None. \n\nWait, but the description says the specific flaw is in the parsing of JP2 files, leading to a use-after-free. The use-after-free is a memory corruption issue, which can be exploited to execute code. However, the base metric for the vulnerability is the direct impact. So the base metrics would be C: High (information disclosure), I: None, A: None. But the attacker can use this to execute code, which would be a different impact.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Note: Since the widget code isn't part of the code base, to apply the patch, the affected widget: Transparent Split Hero must be deleted and reinstalled manually.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a Stored XSS vulnerability in a WordPress plugin. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the widget, which is part of the plugin. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have contributor-level access, that suggests the attack is through the local network, right? Because the attacker has to be logged in and have access to the site. So AV should be Local (L). Wait, but sometimes if it's through a plugin, maybe it's network? Hmm. Wait, the description says \"authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above\" can inject scripts. So the attack vector is local because the attacker has to be logged into the WordPress site. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization. The attacker doesn't need to do anything complex; they just need to input malicious code. So the complexity is Low (L). Because the attack doesn't require special conditions, just the user input.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access. So that's a Low (L) privilege requirement. Because it's not requiring admin privileges, just contributor. So PR is L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says the script executes when a user accesses the injected page. So the user has to visit the page, which implies some user interaction. But the question is whether the user interaction is required. The attack is stored, so the attacker injects the script, and then the user has to click on the page. So UI is Required (R)? Wait, the CVSS definition for UI: \"None (N) if the attack can be performed without any user interaction. Required (R) if the attack requires user interaction.\" Since the user has to access the injected page, which is part of the attack, then UI is Required (R). Wait, but maybe the user interaction is not required. Wait, the attacker injects the script, and then the user's browser executes it when they visit the page. So the user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. So UI is R. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. For example, if the attack is stored, the user has to visit the page, so the user interaction is required. So UI is R. But some sources say that for stored XSS, the user interaction is required. So I think UI is R here.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges. Since the vulnerability is about XSS, which is a confidentiality, integrity, or availability issue. The scope here is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope. The attacker can't elevate privileges beyond what they already have. So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts, which can steal data. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can read sensitive information. Wait, but the description says \"inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the attacker can execute scripts, which could lead to stealing cookies, session tokens, etc. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can inject scripts, which can modify content. So the integrity is High (H) because the attacker can alter data. For example, changing the content of the page.\n\nAvailability (A). The vulnerability doesn't directly affect availability. The attacker can't cause denial of service. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but I need to double-check the UI. Let me think again. The user has to access the page, which is part of the attack. So the user interaction is required. So UI is R. But some might argue that the user interaction is not required because the attacker can inject the script, and the user's browser executes it when they visit. So the user interaction is required.

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. The issue arises when resizing a corrupt ext4 image that has the resize_inode feature cleared. The problem is that the reserved GDT blocks aren't reduced to zero, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when calling reserve_backup_gdb() with an uninitialized resize_inode.\n\nSo, the main issue here is a NULL pointer dereference, which is a critical vulnerability. Let's break down each metric.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is triggered when resizing the filesystem, which is a local operation. The attacker needs to have local access to the system, so AV should be Local (L). Wait, but the resize2fs command is used, which is a user-space tool. However, the actual exploit would require local access to run that command. So AV is Local.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The steps to reproduce involve specific commands and a corrupt image. The complexity is medium, but according to CVSS, if the attack requires some setup (like creating a corrupt image), it's considered High (H) complexity. But maybe the exploit is straightforward once the conditions are met. Hmm. The description says it's \"simply reproduced\" by the steps, so maybe the complexity is Low (L). Wait, the attack complexity is about how hard it is for an attacker to exploit. If the steps are simple, then AC is Low. But the initial setup (like creating a corrupt image) might be considered part of the complexity. I think in this case, since the steps are straightforward, AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have local access to run the resize2fs command. So PR is None (N) because the exploit doesn't require elevated privileges beyond what a regular user has. Wait, but the resize2fs is a user-space tool, so the attacker doesn't need root privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The steps don't mention any user interaction. The attacker can run the commands without user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The NULL pointer dereference could lead to a crash, which might be considered a change in scope. Wait, the scope is whether the vulnerability affects resources beyond those directly impacted. Since the exploit leads to a crash, which could be a denial of service, but the scope here is Unchanged (U) because the same component (ext4 filesystem) is affected. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability leads to a NULL pointer dereference, which could cause a crash, but does it expose any data? Probably not. So C is None (N). Wait, but if the crash leads to a denial of service, that's more about availability. So C is None.\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the crash might not affect data integrity unless the exploit is used to modify data. But the description doesn't mention that. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The crash caused by the NULL pointer dereference would definitely affect availability. So A is High (H).\n\nWait, but the CVSS scoring for availability is High if the attack results in denial of service. So A is High.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nBut wait, the initial analysis might have some errors. Let me check again. The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which is a crash. So the impact is on availability. The scope is Unchanged because the same component is affected. The attack vector is local because the attacker needs to have local access to run the resize2fs command. Attack complexity is Low because the steps are straightforward. Privileges required are None. User interaction is None. So the vector would be AV:L, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. But wait, the CVSS v3.1 base score for this would be calculated based on these metrics. However, the user just wants the base metrics, not the actual score. So the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the original problem says the fix is to add a check to ensure s_reserved_gdt_blocks is zero. The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which is a crash. So the impact is on availability. But maybe the crash could be considered as a denial of service, which is a high impact. So A is High. But the other metrics like C and I are None. So the vector is as above. However, sometimes, if the vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution, the impact would be higher, but here it's just a crash. So the answer should be as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.7000000000000002, "success": true}

However, this approach created a race condition between the DRM scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence is signaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed. This results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns a new job to the pointer. This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns it to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an interrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) for the V3D (Video Core 3D) driver. The issue arises from a race condition between the DRM scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. \n\nThe problem is that the job pointer is set to NULL after job completion, but before the fence is signaled. Then, when the IRQ thread signals the fence, a new job starts. This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ thread sets the job pointer to NULL after the run_job() function has assigned a new job to it. This results in a crash when the new job completes and the GPU emits an interrupt, triggering v3d_irq().\n\nNow, I need to map this to the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. Let's go through each metric one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is related to a race condition in the kernel, which is a local issue. The attacker would need to be in the same process or have local access. So AV is Local (L). Wait, but the description mentions that the race is between the scheduler workqueue and the IRQ thread. Since these are both within the kernel, the attack vector is local. So AV: Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The race condition requires the attacker to exploit the timing between two threads. This is considered high complexity because it's not a straightforward exploit. So AC: High (H).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker needs to have some level of privilege. However, the description doesn't mention that the attacker needs to be root or have specific privileges. Since it's a kernel vulnerability, it's possible that the attacker needs to be in the kernel context. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without any prior privileges, then PR is None (N). But since it's a kernel module, maybe the attacker needs to have some privileges. Wait, the CVE is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have local access. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already in the system, maybe they don't need additional privileges. So PR: None (N). Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already in the system (local user), then they might not need additional privileges. So PR: None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The race condition doesn't require user interaction. The exploit can be triggered by the system's normal operation. So UI: None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and leads to a crash, which is a system-wide issue, the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, then the scope would be Changed (C). However, in this case, the vulnerability leads to a NULL pointer dereference, which is a crash, not necessarily privilege escalation. So the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability leads to a crash, which might not directly affect confidentiality. However, if the crash leads to data exposure, but the description doesn't mention that. So C: None (N). Wait, but the crash could potentially lead to data exposure if the kernel is compromised. However, the CVSS metric for confidentiality is about the ability to read data. Since the vulnerability is a crash, maybe confidentiality isn't directly affected. So C: None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): The crash could lead to data corruption if the kernel is compromised. However, the description doesn't mention that. So I: None (N). Wait, but the crash might not directly affect integrity. So I: None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The crash leads to a system crash, which affects availability. So A: High (H).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The vulnerability causes a NULL pointer dereference, which results in a crash. That's a denial of service, which is a high impact on availability. So A: High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: High (H)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the answer should be in the format with the exact final line. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says to calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score. But the user is asking for the base metrics, not the score. So the answer is the vector string. Let me confirm each metric again.\n\nAttack Vector: Local (L) because the race is between kernel threads, which are local.\n\nAttack Complexity: High (H) because the attacker needs to exploit a race condition, which is complex.\n\nPrivileges Required: None (N) because the attacker needs to be in the system (local user) but doesn't need additional privileges.\n\nUser Interaction: None (N) because the exploit can be triggered without user interaction.\n\nScope: Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to affect a different component (like escalating privileges).\n\nConfidentiality: None (N) because the crash doesn't directly expose data.\n\nIntegrity: None (N) because the crash doesn't directly modify data.\n\nAvailability: High (H) because the crash leads to a denial of service.\n\nSo the vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the problem has C:H, I:H, A:H. But in this case, the vulnerability leads to a crash, which is a denial of service, so A is High. But the other metrics (C and I) are None.

Versions prior to 3.7.0, 2.3.5, 2.1.6, and 1.29.7 have no sanitization in the `/vendor/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet/samples/Engineering/Convert-Online.php` file, which leads to the possibility of a cross-site scripting attack. Versions 3.7.0, 2.3.5, 2.1.6, and 1.29.7 contain a patch for the issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about PhpSpreadsheet having an XSS vulnerability due to lack of sanitization in a specific file. I need to figure out each of the base metrics.\n\nFirst, Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in a sample file, which is part of the library. If an attacker can access that file, maybe through a web server, then the attack vector would be Network (N) because the exploit could be done remotely via HTTP. But wait, the sample file is part of the codebase. If the application is using this file, maybe the attack is local? Hmm. But the description mentions cross-site scripting, which typically requires the attacker to inject code into a web page that is then executed in the user's browser. So the attack vector would be Network because the attacker can send malicious input via the web interface. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is due to no sanitization. The attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps; they just need to input malicious data. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker doesn't need any special privileges. They can exploit this without needing to be authenticated. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). For XSS, usually, the user has to click on a malicious link or input something. But the description says \"possibility of a cross-site scripting attack.\" If the user is required to interact, like clicking a link, then UI:R. But sometimes, if the attack is automatic, like a stored XSS where the user doesn't need to interact, then UI:N. Wait, the sample file is part of the application. If the attacker can inject code into the sample file, maybe the user doesn't need to interact. But the description says \"cross-site scripting attack,\" which can be reflected or stored. If it's reflected, the user has to click on a malicious link. If it's stored, the user might not need to interact. But the description doesn't specify. However, the fact that it's in a sample file might imply that the attacker can inject code into the application's output, which would require user interaction. But I'm not sure. Maybe the default is UI:N if it's a stored XSS. Wait, the CVSS guidelines say that if the attack requires user interaction, then UI:R. If it's a stored XSS, the user might not need to interact. But in this case, the sample file is part of the application. If the attacker can upload a malicious file or inject code into the sample file, then the user might not need to interact. But the problem is that the sample file is part of the code, so maybe the attacker can exploit it when the application is run. But I'm not certain. Maybe the default is UI:N unless the attack requires the user to take some action. Since the description doesn't specify, I'll assume that the attack can be triggered without user interaction, so UI:N.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges. Since it's an XSS, the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope. The attacker can't elevate privileges beyond what the user already has. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). XSS typically doesn't affect confidentiality, but if the attacker can steal session cookies, that's a confidentiality issue. However, the description doesn't mention that. So C:N.\n\nIntegrity (I). XSS can allow the attacker to modify content, so Integrity is High (H). The attacker can inject malicious scripts, which can alter the page's content.\n\nAvailability (A). XSS doesn't directly affect availability, so A:N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:H, A:N. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. Wait, but the user's example had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the description says \"possibility of a cross-site scripting attack.\" XSS can lead to different impacts. If the attacker can steal cookies (confidentiality), modify content (integrity), or cause denial of service (availability). But the description doesn't specify. However, in the absence of specific info, the default for C is N, I is H, A is N. But maybe the user interaction is required. Let me recheck the UI. If the attack is reflected, then UI:R. If it's stored, UI:N. Since the sample file is part of the application, maybe the attacker can inject code into the sample file, which is then served to users. So if the sample file is accessible, then the attacker can inject code that is served to users, which would be stored XSS. In that case, the user doesn't need to interact. So UI:N. So the initial assessment holds. Therefore, the vector is as above. But I need to make sure. Let me check the CVSS guidelines again. For XSS, the default is usually C:N, I:H, A:N.

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in versions prior to 3.4.6 in the `pre_cadastro_atendido.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `msg_e` parameter. Version 3.4.6 fixes the issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a Reflected XSS vulnerability in WeGIA. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in a web endpoint, so the attack is through the network. The user can send a malicious script via the msg_e parameter, which is a request parameter. So AV should be Network (N). \n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). Reflected XSS typically requires the user to click on a malicious link, which is a low complexity because the attacker doesn't need to exploit multiple steps. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior access; they just need to trick the user into clicking the link.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is Required (R) because the user has to interact with the malicious link for the attack to work. But wait, some sources say that for XSS, UI is Required. However, sometimes it's considered that the user interaction is part of the attack vector. Let me check. Since the user has to click the link, UI is Required (R). But I need to confirm. Wait, the CVSS guidelines for XSS: if the attack requires user interaction, then UI is R. So yes, UI is R here.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to elevate privileges beyond the user's own. The scope doesn't change; the attack is within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is None (N) because the XSS doesn't disclose confidential information. The attacker can inject scripts, but not read data from the user's session unless they have access to the session. But the description doesn't mention that. So C is N.\n\nIntegrity (I) is High (H) because the attacker can modify the user's session data or inject scripts that alter the page content. Wait, but the vulnerability is reflected XSS, which allows the attacker to inject scripts that can modify the page, so the integrity is compromised. So I is H.\n\nAvailability (A) is None (N) because the attack doesn't directly affect the availability of the service. The attacker can't cause denial of service through this method unless the script is designed to do so, which isn't mentioned here. So A is N.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each metric. For example, the user interaction is required, so UI is R. The attack vector is network because it's through the web. Attack complexity is low because the attacker just needs to send a crafted URL. Privileges required are none. Scope is unchanged. Confidentiality is none, integrity is high, availability none. \n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. Wait, but some sources might say that for XSS, the UI is not required. Wait, the user has to click the link, so UI is required. So UI:R. But I need to check the CVSS guidelines. According to CVSS v3.1, for XSS, the User Interaction is Required (R) because the user must click on the malicious link. So that's correct. \n\nSo the final vector is as above. Let me make sure all the metrics are correctly assigned. Yes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 0.40000000000000036, "success": true}

This issue is fixed in iPadOS 17.7.4, iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3. Restoring a maliciously crafted backup file may lead to modification of protected system files.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description, and I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let me start by understanding the description.\n\nThe issue is about symlinks and restoring a malicious backup file leading to modification of protected system files. The fix is in iPadOS 17.7.4, iOS 18.3, etc. So the vulnerability is related to how symlinks are handled when restoring backups.\n\nFirst, Attack Vector (AV). The problem is that a malicious backup file can be restored, which would require the attacker to have access to the system where the backup is being restored. Since the backup is being restored, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the device to perform the restoration. But wait, could it be Network (N)? If the backup is being transferred over a network, maybe. But the description doesn't mention network access. It's more about local restoration, so AV is probably Local (L). Wait, but if the attacker can create a malicious backup file and then restore it, that's a local attack. So AV: Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The complexity here is whether the attacker needs to have some specific conditions. The description says \"maliciously crafted backup file\" which implies that the attacker has to create a specific file. But the complexity is low if the attacker can just create the file and restore it. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to have the ability to restore a backup. If the user is logged in and has the necessary permissions, then PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges beyond what's required to restore the backup. So PR: None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The user would need to perform the restoration action. If the user is required to manually restore the backup, then UI is Required (R). But if the system automatically restores backups, maybe UI is None. However, the description says \"restoring a maliciously crafted backup file\" which implies that the user has to initiate the restoration. So UI: Required (R). Wait, but sometimes if the attack is automated, maybe UI is None. Hmm. Let me think again. If the attacker can create the malicious file and the system automatically restores it without user interaction, then UI would be None. But the description doesn't specify. However, in many cases, restoring a backup might require user action. So I'll go with UI: Required (R).\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The issue is modifying protected system files, which is a different component (system files) than the original component (backup restoration). So the scope is Changed (C). Because the attack affects a different component (system files) than the one being exploited (backup restoration). So S: Changed (C).\n\nConfidentiality (C). The problem is modification of system files, which affects integrity, not confidentiality. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can modify protected system files, which directly affects integrity. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A). The issue is about modification, not about denial of service. So A is None (N).\n\nWait, but maybe the modification could lead to availability issues if the system files are critical. But the description doesn't mention that. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: Required (R)\nS: Changed (C)\nC: None (N)\nI: High (H)\nA: None (N)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but I need to check again. Let me verify each metric again.\n\nAttack Vector: Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the device to restore the backup. If the backup is on a network, maybe N, but the description doesn't mention that. So L is correct.\n\nAttack Complexity: Low (L) because the attacker just needs to create a malicious file and restore it. No complex steps.\n\nPrivileges Required: None (N) because the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges beyond what's needed to restore the backup.\n\nUser Interaction: Required (R) because the user has to perform the restoration. If the system automatically restores, then UI:N. But the description says \"restoring a maliciously crafted backup file\" which implies that the user is the one doing the restoration. So UI:R.\n\nScope: Changed (C) because the attack affects system files, which is a different component than the backup restoration.\n\nConfidentiality: None (N) because the issue is about modification, not data disclosure.\n\nIntegrity: High (H) because the attacker can modify system files.\n\nAvailability: None (N) because there's no mention of denial of service.\n\nSo the vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but I've seen some cases where UI is None if the attack is automated. Let me check the original description again. The description says \"Restoring a maliciously crafted backup file may lead to modification of protected system files.\" So the user has to restore the backup. Therefore, UI is Required (R). So the answer should have UI:R.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "score": 0.7999999999999998, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a WordPress plugin vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the shortcode, which is part of the plugin. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have contributor-level access, that suggests the attack is happening from within the same network or local environment. Wait, but the description says \"authenticated attackers with contributor-level access\". So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker has to be logged in and have access to the system. But wait, sometimes if the attack is through a web interface, it might be Network (N). Hmm. Wait, the plugin is part of WordPress, so if the attacker is on the same network, maybe it's Network? Or is it Local because the attacker has to be authenticated? Let me think. The attack requires the attacker to be authenticated, so they can't just access it from the network. So AV would be Local (L) because the attacker needs to be logged in. But wait, the vulnerability is in the shortcode, which is part of the plugin. So if the attacker is a contributor, they can access the site and inject scripts. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker has to be authenticated and have access to the site. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping\". The attacker doesn't need to do anything complex, just inject the script. So Attack Complexity is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some level of access, but not root or admin. Wait, contributor-level access is a specific role. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have a user account with contributor access, which is a low privilege level compared to admin. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says the script executes when a user accesses the injected page. So the user has to visit the page, which implies that the attacker's payload is executed when the user interacts with the page. But does that require user interaction? The user has to click on the malicious link or view the page. So UI is Required (R) because the user has to interact with the page for the script to execute. Wait, but sometimes in XSS, the user interaction is required. So UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts, which can affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Since the scope is unchanged (the attack is within the same component), S is Unchanged (U). Wait, the scope is whether the attack affects other components. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability to gain access to other components, then scope is Changed (C). But in this case, the vulnerability is in the plugin, and the attack is limited to the same component. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can inject scripts, which could steal user data. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can read sensitive information.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can modify the page content, so they can alter data. So Integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The attacker could potentially cause denial of service, but the description doesn't mention that. So Availability is None (N) unless there's a way to disrupt the service. But the description doesn't specify that, so A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the user interaction is required. Let me check again. The user has to access the injected page, which is part of the attack. So UI is Required (R). So the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. But wait, the original description says \"authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the user interaction is required because the user has to access the page. So UI is Required (R). So the final vector is as above. Let me confirm each metric again.\n\nAV: Local (L) because the attacker is authenticated and has access to the system. AC: Low (L) because no complex steps. PR: Low (L) because contributor access. UI: Required (R) because the user has to access the page. S: Unchanged (U) because the attack is within the same component. C: High (H) because data can be stolen. I: High (H) because content can be altered.

The user provided a CVE description about a memory leak in the Linux kernel's dmaengine driver. The fix involves calling put_device() when device_register() fails and freeing the name allocated in dev_set_name() via kobject_cleanup().\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the kernel, so an attacker would need to have local access. But wait, the description mentions a memory leak. Memory leaks typically don't allow remote execution, so AV is likely Local (L). But wait, if the device is registered, maybe an attacker could exploit this through a local process. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The fix requires calling put_device() and freeing the name. The complexity here is low because the vulnerability is a memory leak, which doesn't require complex steps. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have local access to the device, so PR is None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't require elevated privileges. Wait, but if the attacker is local, maybe they already have privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. Since the memory leak is in the kernel, the attacker would need to be local, but the PR is about the privileges required to exploit it. If the vulnerability is a memory leak, maybe it doesn't require any specific privileges beyond being local. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a memory leak, which doesn't require user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to gain higher privileges. The memory leak affects the system's resources but doesn't change the scope of the attack. So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The memory leak doesn't directly affect confidentiality. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the memory leak doesn't affect the integrity of the system. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The memory leak could lead to resource exhaustion, which might affect availability. However, the description doesn't mention that. But since it's a memory leak, it's possible that the system could run out of memory, leading to availability issues. So A is High (H) if the leak is significant. But the CVE description doesn't specify that. Hmm. Wait, the fix is about freeing the name in a callback. If the memory leak is not severe, maybe A is None. But the question is about the CVSS score. Since the vulnerability is a memory leak, the impact on availability could be High if it's a significant leak. However, without more info, maybe the default is to assume that the leak could lead to denial of service, so A is High (H). But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The CVSS scoring for availability is High if the vulnerability can cause denial of service. Since the memory leak could lead to resource exhaustion, which is a denial of service, then A is High (H).\n\nWait, but the original description says that the fix is to call put_device() when device_register() fails. So the memory leak is in the name allocated in dev_set_name(). If the name isn't freed, it's a memory leak. But how severe is that? If the system is using a lot of memory, it could lead to availability issues. So I think A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nWait, but the user's example had C:H, I:H, A:H. But in this case, the vulnerability is a memory leak. So maybe the impact is on availability. Let me check the CVSS scoring again. For a memory leak, the impact on availability could be High if it's a significant leak. But if it's a minor leak, maybe Low. However, the description doesn't specify. Since the fix is to free the name, which is a resource, the leak could be significant. So A is High. But the other metrics (C and I) are None.

The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in the GiveWP plugin. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is due to a misconfigured capability check. The description says authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access can exploit it. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the system, that suggests the attack vector is Local (L). Because the attacker has to be logged in and have access to the application, not remote. So AV:L.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is a misconfigured capability check. If the check is just a simple condition, maybe the complexity is Low. But if there are multiple steps or requires specific conditions, it might be High. The description doesn't mention any complexity, so I think it's Low. AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs Subscriber-level access, which is a low privilege level. So PR:L. Because the attacker doesn't need admin rights, just Subscriber, which is a lower privilege.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says \"authenticated attackers\" can exploit it.

First, I need to understand the CVE description. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the sysctl_igmp_llm_reports. The issue is a data race where reading this value can be changed concurrently, so they added READ_ONCE() to prevent that. \n\nSo, the main points here are that there's a race condition between reading and writing the sysctl variable. That suggests a concurrency issue, which might relate to the attack vector and complexity. \n\nNow, the CVSS base metrics. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is a local component. But since it's a data race, the attacker would need to be local to exploit it. Wait, but the sysctl is a system call, which is accessible via local processes. So AV is Local (L)? Or maybe Network (N) if it's a remote exploit. Wait, the problem is that the sysctl is being read and written concurrently. So the attacker would need to be local to access the sysctl variable. So AV is Local (L). But wait, sysctl is a kernel parameter that can be accessed via local processes. So the attack vector is Local. So AV: L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The data race requires that the attacker can read and write the variable at the same time. The fix adds READ_ONCE(), which implies that the original code didn't have proper synchronization. So the complexity is High (H) because the attacker needs to have both read and write access to the variable, which might require more complex steps. But maybe the complexity is Low if the attacker can exploit it with minimal steps. Wait, the data race is a concurrency issue. The attack complexity here is High because the attacker needs to have concurrent access to both read and write the variable. So AC: H.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The sysctl is a kernel parameter, so the attacker would need to have local privileges. But since it's a kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need to be local. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, then PR is None (N) because they can exploit it without needing additional privileges. Wait, but the sysctl is a kernel parameter, so maybe the attacker needs to have some privileges. Wait, sysctl variables are usually accessible to processes with sufficient privileges. For example, in Linux, some sysctl variables require root access. But the description doesn't specify. However, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to be local. So PR is None (N) because the attacker is already local. Or maybe High (H) if the attacker needs to have root privileges. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. But since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the sysctl is a kernel parameter, the attacker would need to be local and have the necessary privileges to access the sysctl. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, then PR is None (N). But if the sysctl is protected, maybe the attacker needs to have certain privileges. However, the description doesn't mention that. So I think PR is None (N) because the attacker is already local. So PR: N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability doesn't require user interaction. The data race can be exploited by a local attacker without needing user input. So UI: None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges. Since the vulnerability is a data race in the kernel, which is a privilege escalation, the scope would be Changed (C). Wait, the scope is about whether the vulnerability affects resources beyond those the attacker is already using. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges (like from user to root), then the scope is Changed. But in this case, the data race is in the kernel, so the attacker is already in the kernel. So the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, the scope is whether the attack can affect resources beyond the initial privilege level. If the attacker is already local, then the scope is Unchanged. So S: U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows reading of the sysctl variable, but the data race could lead to incorrect values being read. However, the main issue is that the variable is being modified concurrently. If the attacker can read the variable, they might get incorrect data, which could be a confidentiality issue. But the description says that the fix is to prevent data races, which could lead to data corruption. So maybe the confidentiality is not directly affected. However, if the sysctl variable contains sensitive information, then the data race could allow an attacker to read it. But the description doesn't specify. So maybe the confidentiality is None (N) because the main issue is data integrity. Wait, the data race could lead to incorrect values being read, which is an integrity issue. So C: N.\n\nIntegrity (I): The data race could allow an attacker to modify the sysctl variable, leading to incorrect values. So the integrity is High (H) because the attacker can modify the variable, which affects the system's integrity. So I: H.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability is a data race, which could lead to data corruption, but not directly affect availability. Unless the data race causes a crash or denial of service. The description doesn't mention that. So A: N.\n\nWait, but the data race could lead to a crash if the variable is modified while being read. So maybe Availability is High (H) if the data race can cause a denial of service. But the description doesn't specify that. The fix is to prevent data races, which might prevent crashes. So maybe A is None (N). But I'm not sure. The original problem is a data race, which could lead to data corruption, but not necessarily availability. So A: N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: H (High complexity)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but I need to check again. Let me re-examine each metric.\n\nAttack Vector: The vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker must be local. So AV: L.\n\nAttack Complexity: The data race requires that the attacker can read and write the variable concurrently. The complexity is High because the attacker needs to have both read and write access, which might require more steps. So AC: H.\n\nPrivileges Required: The attacker is local, so PR: N.\n\nUser Interaction: No UI needed. UI: N.\n\nScope: The vulnerability is in the kernel, so the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attacker is already in the kernel. So S: U.\n\nConfidentiality: The data race could allow reading of the variable, but the main issue is integrity. So C: N.\n\nIntegrity: The data race allows modification of the variable, leading to integrity issues. So I: H.\n\nAvailability: The data race could lead to data corruption, but not necessarily availability. So A: N.\n\nSo the final vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is a data race, which could lead to data corruption. So maybe the integrity is High. But the CVSS scoring for integrity is High if the vulnerability allows modification of data. So yes, I: H.\n\nSo the answer should be that vector.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.39999999999999947, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's ets qdisc code. The issue is that ets_class_from_arg() can index an out-of-bounds class when clid is 0. This leads to an array index out of bounds, which might cause local privilege escalation.\n\nSo, the main points here are: it's a buffer overflow (OOB) in a kernel module, which could lead to privilege escalation. Let's break down each metric.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is triggered via a local user. The log shows that the user is running a poc (proof of concept) as UID 0, which is the root user. But wait, the user interaction is required? Wait, the log shows that the user is running a poc, which might be a local exploit. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be on the same system. But wait, the log shows that the user is UID 0, which is the root. But the vulnerability is in the kernel, so maybe it's a local exploit. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity here is low because the exploit doesn't require any special conditions. The OOB is triggered by passing clid 0, which is a simple input. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have local access. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attacker must be local. But the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit. Since the user is already local, maybe PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any privileges beyond being local. Wait, but the exploit could lead to privilege escalation. Wait, the description says \"may cause local privilege escalation.\" So the initial exploit requires local access, but the privilege escalation is part of the exploit. So PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any privileges to exploit the vulnerability. Wait, but the initial access is local. So PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to have any privileges beyond being local. Hmm, maybe PR is Low (L) if the exploit requires some privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since the attacker is already local, maybe PR is None (N). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. The PR metric is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, then they can exploit it without needing any additional privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The log shows that the user is running a poc, which might be a local exploit. But does the exploit require user interaction? The description doesn't mention any need for user interaction, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain privileges beyond the initial access. Since the vulnerability can lead to privilege escalation, the scope changes from the initial user (local) to higher privileges. So S is Changed (C).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability is an OOB, which could lead to data corruption or unauthorized access. But the description mentions privilege escalation, which affects integrity and availability. However, if the OOB leads to memory corruption, it might allow reading sensitive data. But the description doesn't specify. Since the main impact is privilege escalation, maybe C is None (N) unless there's a data leak. But the problem says \"overflow may cause local privilege escalation.\" So maybe confidentiality isn't directly affected. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Privilege escalation would allow the attacker to modify system data, so I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): If the exploit causes a denial of service, then A is High (H). But the description doesn't mention that. However, OOB can lead to crashes, so maybe A is High (H). But the main impact here is privilege escalation, which is more about integrity. Wait, the CVSS metrics are about the impact. So if the vulnerability allows privilege escalation, that's a change in scope. The actual impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability would be based on the exploit's effect. Since the exploit leads to privilege escalation, which is a change in scope, the base metrics for C, I, A would be based on the impact of the exploit. But the original description says the overflow may cause local privilege escalation. So the exploit allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, which would affect integrity (since they can modify system data) and availability (if the exploit causes a crash). But the main impact here is the privilege escalation, which is a scope change. So for the base metrics, the C, I, A would be based on the impact of the exploit. However, the CVSS v3.1 base metrics are about the impact of the vulnerability without considering the scope. Wait, the scope is whether the impact is on the same component or a different component. So if the vulnerability allows privilege escalation, the scope is Changed (C), and the base metrics for C, I, A would be the impact of the exploit. But the original description says the overflow may cause local privilege escalation. So the exploit allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, which would allow them to modify system data (integrity) and possibly cause denial of service (availability). But the description doesn't mention data confidentiality being compromised. So for the base metrics, C is None (N), I is High (H), A is High (H). Wait, but the CVSS v3.1 base metrics are calculated based on the impact of the vulnerability. If the vulnerability allows privilege escalation, then the impact on integrity is High (H) because the attacker can modify system data. Availability could be High (H) if the exploit causes a crash. But the description doesn't mention that. However, the OOB can lead to a crash, so A is High (H). So putting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Changed (C)\nC: None (N)\nI: High (H)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H\n\nWait, but I need to check if the scope is Changed (C) because the vulnerability allows privilege escalation. Yes, because the scope is Changed when the impact is on a different component (e.g., from user to root). So S is Changed (C). Then, the base metrics for C, I, A are based on the impact of the exploit. Since the exploit allows privilege escalation, which is a change in scope, the base metrics for C, I, A would be the impact of the exploit. However, the original description says the overflow may cause local privilege escalation. So the exploit allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, which would allow them to modify system data (integrity) and possibly cause denial of service (availability). So I is High (H), A is High (H). Confidentiality is not directly affected, so C is None (N).\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 1.2000000000000002, "success": true}

This vulnerability allows attacker to manipulate SQL queries and access sensitive database information, such as table names and sensitive data. Version 3.4.6 fixes the issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to understand the CVE description. The vulnerability is a SQL Injection in a web application. The affected parameter is 'idatendido_familiares' in a specific PHP endpoint. The attacker can manipulate SQL queries to access sensitive data like table names and data.\n\nStarting with the base metrics. Let's go step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in a web endpoint, so the attack is over the network. So AV is Network (N). Because the attacker doesn't need to be physically present or have local access.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): SQL Injection typically requires the attacker to craft specific input, which might be considered low complexity. But sometimes, if there's a lot of steps, it could be high. But since it's a direct injection, I think AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any prior privileges. They can exploit this from the public internet. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any need for user interaction. The attacker can exploit it without user action. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows access to sensitive data, but does it change the scope? If the attack affects the same component (like accessing database info), then Scope is Unchanged (U). But if it allows access to other components, it's Changed (C). Since the vulnerability is about accessing database info, which is part of the same component, S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can access sensitive data, so this is High (H). The data includes table names and sensitive info, which is a high impact on confidentiality.\n\nIntegrity (I): The description doesn't mention any modification of data. The attacker is only reading, so Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): Similarly, there's no mention of denial of service or resource exhaustion. So Availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Wait, but the example in the problem had I:H and A:H. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says the attacker can access sensitive database information, which is confidentiality. But what about integrity and availability? The description says \"access sensitive database information, such as table names and sensitive data.\" There's no mention of modifying data or causing a DoS. So I and A should be None. So the vector is as above. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the CVSS scoring again. For example, if the vulnerability allows access to data, that's C:H. If there's no mention of modifying data or causing availability issues, then I and A are N. So the final vector should be as I wrote.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 1.3000000000000007, "success": true}

An unsafe reading of environment file could potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. When loaded on an Windows application, Netty attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file, the Netty application crash. A similar issue was previously reported as CVE-2024-47535. This issue was fixed, but the fix was incomplete in that null-bytes were not counted against the input limit. Commit d1fbda62d3a47835d3fb35db8bd42ecc205a5386 contains an updated fix.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in Netty, where an unsafe reading of an environment file can cause a denial of service. On Windows, if an attacker creates a large file, the Netty application crashes. The fix was incomplete because null-bytes weren't counted against the input limit.\n\nSo, the main issue here is a denial of service (DoS) via a crafted file. Let's break down each metric.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The attacker needs to create a large file. Since the application is running on Windows, the attacker would have to have access to the file system. But the vulnerability is triggered when the application tries to read a file that doesn't exist. Wait, the description says the attacker creates a large file. So maybe the attack vector is local? Because the attacker has to have access to the file system where the application is running. But if the application is running on a server, maybe the attacker can create a file on the same system. So AV would be Local (L) because the attacker needs to be on the same system to create the file. But wait, if the application is a service, maybe the attacker can't access the file system. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the attack is through a network if the file is being accessed over a network. But the description says \"when loaded on a Windows application,\" so maybe the file is local. So AV is Local (L). Wait, but the problem is that the attacker creates a file that the application tries to read. So the attack vector is local because the attacker has to be on the same system to create the file. So AV: Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The attacker needs to create a large file. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need any special tools or knowledge beyond creating a file. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any special privileges. They just need to create a file. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any user interaction. The attacker creates the file, and the application crashes when it reads it. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to gain higher privileges or access other systems. The DoS is within the same component.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability doesn't disclose any data. It's a DoS, so C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): The application crashes, but there's no mention of data being modified. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The DoS is a denial of service, so Availability is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Wait, but the user mentioned that the fix was incomplete, but the actual vulnerability is a DoS. So the impact is on availability. So A is High. The other metrics are as above. Let me double-check each metric again.\n\nAttack Vector: Local (L) because the attacker needs to create a file on the same system. Attack Complexity: Low (L) because creating a file is simple. Privileges: None. User Interaction: None. Scope: Unchanged. Confidentiality and Integrity: None. Availability: High.

This array is passed to usb_check_int_endpoints function from usb.c core driver, which executes a for loop that iterates over the elements of the passed array. Not finding a null element at the end of the array, it tries to read the next, non-existent element, crashing the kernel. To fix this, a 0 element was added at the end of the array to break the for loop. [1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=9c9179ac46169c56c1ad\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a stack-out-of-bounds read in the Linux kernel's hid-thrustmaster driver. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each metric one by one. \n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the HID driver, which is part of the kernel. The issue is a stack-out-of-bounds read. Since the driver is part of the kernel, an attacker would need to have local access to exploit this. So AV should be Local (L). Wait, but wait. The description mentions that the array is passed to a core driver function. If the vulnerability is in a driver, maybe it's accessible via local access. But if the driver is for a USB device, could it be accessed over the network? Probably not. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability requires the attacker to have access to the device and to trigger the loop without a null terminator. The fix was adding a zero element. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need special tools or steps beyond triggering the code path. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have local access to the system, so they would need to be logged in as a user. But since it's a kernel vulnerability, maybe the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is in a driver, the attacker might need to be a local user. But if the driver is for a USB device, maybe the attacker can exploit it without needing root. So PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges beyond local access. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, then PR is None. But maybe the driver is part of the kernel, so the attacker can exploit it without needing to have any specific privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a stack-out-of-bounds read. The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The attacker can trigger it by sending a malicious input, which would be a local exploit. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit would affect the kernel's integrity, but the scope here is whether the impact is on the same component or a different one. The vulnerability is in the kernel, so the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope. Wait, the scope is Changed (C) if the attack affects a different component. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, then scope is changed. But in this case, the vulnerability is a stack overflow, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, but the description doesn't specify that. However, the original issue is a stack-out-of-bounds read, which could lead to a crash or potentially code execution. But the scope here is whether the attack affects a different component. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit leads to a crash, then the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack is within the same component. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability is a stack-out-of-bounds read. If the attacker can read data from the stack, that would affect confidentiality. However, the description says it's a read, so the attacker could potentially read sensitive data. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): If the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data, then I would be High. But the description mentions a read, not a write. However, a stack overflow could potentially allow code execution, which would affect integrity. But the original issue is a read, so maybe the integrity is not directly affected. Wait, the vulnerability is a stack-out-of-bounds read, which could lead to a crash, but not necessarily modifying data. However, if the attacker can overwrite the stack, that would affect integrity. But the description doesn't mention that. So maybe I is None (N). Wait, but the original issue is a read, not a write. So the integrity is not directly affected. However, if the exploit leads to arbitrary code execution, then integrity would be High. But the description doesn't specify that. The fix was adding a zero to the array to prevent the loop from reading beyond the array. So the vulnerability is a read, not a write. Therefore, the integrity is not affected. So I is None (N). Wait, but the problem is a stack-out-of-bounds read. If the attacker can read data from the stack, that's a confidentiality issue. So C is High. But for integrity, if the attacker can modify data, then I is High. But the vulnerability is a read, not a write. So I is None (N). Wait, but maybe the stack overflow could allow the attacker to overwrite data. However, the description says it's a read, not a write. So I think I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability causes a kernel crash, which would affect availability. So A is High (H).\n\nWait, but let me check again. The vulnerability is a stack-out-of-bounds read. If the attacker can read data from the stack, that's confidentiality. If the read is of arbitrary data, then C is High. But if the read is of non-sensitive data, maybe C is Low. However, the description doesn't specify. But in the absence of specific info, the default for C is High if the vulnerability allows reading data. So C is High. For I, since it's a read, not a write, I is None. For A, the crash would affect availability, so A is High.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: High (H)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H\n\nWait, but I need to check if the scope is changed. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, then scope is changed. But in this case, the vulnerability is a stack overflow, which could lead to code execution, which would change the scope. Wait, the scope is Changed (C) if the attack affects a different component. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain root privileges, then the scope is changed. But the original issue is a stack-out-of-bounds read. If the exploit leads to code execution, then the scope is changed. However, the description doesn't mention that. The fix was adding a zero to the array to prevent the loop from reading beyond. So the vulnerability is a read, which could lead to a crash, but not necessarily code execution. So the scope is Unchanged (U). Therefore, S is U.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.6000000000000005, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a WordPress plugin vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the vulnerability is in the 'wee' shortcode, and attackers need contributor-level access. Since the attacker has to be authenticated and has access to the site, that suggests the attack vector is Local (L). Because the attacker isn't exploiting something over the network or adjacent network, but rather through the local system via the plugin's functionality. So AV:L.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The attacker doesn't need to do anything complex; they just need to provide the malicious input. So Attack Complexity is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low privilege level. Wait, but the question says PR options are None, Low, High. Wait, the user's options for PR are None (N), Low (L), High (H). Wait, the description says \"authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above\". So the attacker needs to have contributor access, which is a low privilege level. So PR is Low (L)? Or is it None? Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have contributor access, that's a low privilege level. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but sometimes PR is considered as whether the attacker needs to be authenticated. Wait, the PR metric in CVSS v3.1 is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's part of the PR. Wait, the PR options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). So if the attacker needs to have contributor access, which is a low privilege level, then PR is Low (L). But maybe the PR is None because the attacker doesn't need to have any privileges beyond being authenticated. Wait, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to have contributor access, that's a low privilege level. So PR is Low (L). Hmm, but I need to check the exact definition. According to CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's part of the PR. Wait, the PR metric is about the level of access required. For example, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered as PR: Low (L) because it's a low privilege level. Wait, but the PR options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). So if the attacker needs to have contributor access, which is a low privilege level, then PR is Low (L). But maybe the PR is None because the attacker doesn't need to have any specific privileges beyond being authenticated. Wait, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to have contributor access, that's a low privilege level. So PR is Low (L). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The PR metric is about the level of access required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's part of the PR. But the PR options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). So if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered as PR: Low (L) because it's a low privilege level. Wait, but maybe the PR is None because the attacker doesn't need to have any specific privileges beyond being authenticated. Wait, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required. For example, if the vulnerability requires the attacker to have administrative privileges, that's High (H). If it's just authenticated, then it's Low (L). So in this case, the attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low privilege level. So PR is Low (L). But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check the example. For example, if the vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated, then PR is Low (L). So in this case, the attacker needs to be authenticated (contributor-level access), so PR is Low (L). So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says the attacker can inject scripts that execute when a user accesses the page. The user interaction is required? Wait, the user has to access the injected page. So the attacker injects the script, and then the user has to visit the page. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but the user interaction is required for the attack to work. So UI:R. Wait, but the description says \"authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the attacker injects the script, and then the user has to access the page. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI:R.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The description says the vulnerability is in the plugin's shortcode, and the attack is on the pages that the user accesses. Since the attack is on the same component (the plugin's functionality), the scope is Unchanged (U). So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts, which can steal data. So confidentiality is High (H). Because the attacker can read sensitive information from the user's session or other data.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject scripts, which can modify data. So integrity is High (H). Because the attacker can alter data on the site.\n\nAvailability (A): The attack is about injecting scripts, which might not directly affect availability. Unless the script causes a denial of service, but the description doesn't mention that. So availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:L (Local), AC:L (Low complexity), PR:L (Low privileges), UI:R (User interaction required), S:U (Scope unchanged), C:H (High confidentiality), I:H (High integrity), A:N (No availability impact).\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The user interaction is required because the user has to access the page with the injected script. So UI:R. But some might argue that the user interaction is not required because the attacker can inject the script, and the user's access is just the execution. But according to the CVSS definition, UI:R means the attack requires user interaction. So if the user has to click on a link or something, then UI:R. In this case, the user has to access the page, which is part of the attack. So UI:R is correct.\n\nAnother point: the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker has to be authenticated and have contributor access, which is local to the system. So AV:L.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 1.1999999999999993, "success": true}

This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in the lunary-ai/lunary application. The main issues are missing access control and lack of slug uniqueness validation.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The problem is that the endpoint doesn't validate permissions, so an attacker would need to access the endpoint. Since the endpoint is part of the application, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated to access the endpoint. Wait, but if the endpoint is accessible over the network, maybe it's Network (N)? Hmm. Wait, the description says the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without proper permissions. So if the endpoint is accessible via HTTP, then an attacker could send a request over the network. But the user might need to be authenticated to access the endpoint. Wait, the problem is that the access control is missing. So even if the attacker is authenticated, they can bypass permissions. But the attack vector here is that the attacker can send a request to the endpoint, which is part of the application's API. So if the endpoint is accessible over the network, then AV would be Network (N). But if the attacker needs to be on the same network or have local access, it's Local. Wait, the description doesn't specify if the endpoint is accessible over the network. But in most web applications, endpoints are accessed over the network. So I think AV is Network (N). But maybe the attack requires the attacker to be authenticated, so maybe it's Local? Wait, the attack vector is how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can send a request to the endpoint without needing to be on the same network, then AV is Network. But if the attacker needs to be authenticated, then maybe it's Local. Wait, the problem is that the access control is missing. So even if the attacker is authenticated, they can bypass the checks. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated to access the endpoint. Wait, but the attacker could be an external user who has access to the API. So maybe AV is Network (N) because the endpoint is accessible over the network. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The endpoint is part of the application's API, which is typically accessed over the network. So the attack vector would be Network (N) because the attacker can send a request over the network. But if the attacker needs to be authenticated, then maybe it's Local. Wait, the attack vector is about how the attacker can reach the vulnerability. If the attacker can send a request to the endpoint without needing to be on the same machine, then it's Network. So I think AV is Network (N).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires the attacker to send a request to the endpoint without proper permissions. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need any special tools or steps beyond sending a request. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the endpoint, but the access control is missing. So the attacker needs to have some level of authentication. However, the description says \"unauthorized users\" can create checklists. Wait, the problem is that the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating permissions. So if the attacker is an unauthorized user, they can't access the endpoint. Wait, maybe the endpoint is accessible to authenticated users, but the access control is missing. So the attacker needs to be authenticated to access the endpoint, but the access control is missing. So PR would be Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some level of authentication (like being a user) to access the endpoint. Wait, but the description says \"unauthorized users\" can create checklists. That suggests that the endpoint is accessible to anyone, not just authenticated users. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me re-read the CVE description. It says \"the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions.\" So the term \"users\" here might mean authenticated users. So the attacker needs to be authenticated to access the endpoint, but the access control is missing. Therefore, the attacker needs to have some privileges (like being a user) to access the endpoint. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some level of authentication (like being a user) to exploit the vulnerability. But if the endpoint is accessible to anyone (unauthenticated), then PR would be None (N). But the description says \"users\" which implies that the endpoint is for authenticated users. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability doesn't require any user interaction. The attacker can send a request to the endpoint, and the system will process it without needing user input. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability affects a different component. The problem is that the checklists can be modified without permission, leading to data integrity issues. The scope here is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability affects the same component (the checklists endpoint) and doesn't change the scope to a different component. Wait, but the data integrity issue is about the same component. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to create or modify checklists. This could lead to unauthorized access to data, but the main issue is data integrity. However, if the attacker can create checklists, they might be able to access data that's part of those checklists. But the description doesn't mention confidentiality loss. So C is None (N) or Low (L)? Wait, the problem is that the attacker can create or modify checklists, which could allow them to access data that's part of those checklists. But the description doesn't specify that. So maybe C is None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't directly affect confidentiality. However, if the checklists contain sensitive data, then the attacker could access that data. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability allows the attacker to modify existing checklists by reusing the slug field. This leads to data integrity issues because legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious data. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't directly affect availability. The main issue is data integrity, not denial of service. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Network (N)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: Low (L)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: High (H)\nA: None (N)\n\nWait, but the description mentions that the endpoint doesn't validate the uniqueness of the slug field, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists. This could lead to data integrity issues. So I is High (H). But what about the access control part? The missing access control allows unauthorized users to create checklists. If the attacker can create checklists, they might be able to access data that's part of those checklists. But the description doesn't specify that. So maybe C is None (N) because the confidentiality isn't directly affected. However, if the checklists contain sensitive data, then the attacker could access that data. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think C is None (N).\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. Wait, but the user might have different interpretations. Let me check again.\n\nAnother thought: If the attacker can create checklists, they might be able to access data that's part of those checklists. But the description doesn't specify that. So maybe C is None (N). However, if the checklists are part of the application's data, then the attacker could access that data. But the problem is about modifying existing checklists, not accessing others. So maybe C is None (N).\n\nAlternatively, if the attacker can create checklists, they might be able to access data that's part of those checklists. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think C is None (N).\n\nSo the final vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. But wait, the user might have different opinions. Let me check the original description again.\n\nThe CVE says that the missing access control allows unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing permission checks. So the attacker can create checklists, which might be considered as modifying data (integrity) or accessing data (confidentiality). But the main issue is that the attacker can create or modify checklists, which affects data integrity. So I is High (H). The confidentiality might not be directly affected unless the checklists contain sensitive data.

A malicious actor can leverage this vulnerability to cause a crash, read sensitive data, or execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring problem. The user provided a CVE description, and I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string. Let me start by recalling the CVSS v3.1 base metrics and their definitions.\n\nFirst, the CVE says a maliciously crafted DWFX file can cause an Out-of-Bounds Read vulnerability in Autodesk Navisworks. The attacker can crash, read sensitive data, or execute arbitrary code. \n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is triggered by a file, which is typically a file on the local system. But wait, the file is a DWFX, which is a file format. If the file is opened locally, that's a Local (L) attack vector. However, if the file is delivered via a network, like a remote server, then it's Network (N). The description doesn't specify if the file is delivered over the network or locally. But since it's a file that's parsed, it's more likely that the attack is local. But sometimes, if the file is served over the network, it could be Network. Hmm. Wait, the user says \"when parsed through Autodesk Navisworks\"—so the user would have to open the file, which is a local action. So AV is Local (L). But maybe the file is delivered via a network, like a web server. But without more info, I think the default is to assume that the attack vector is Local unless stated otherwise. So AV: L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is an Out-of-Bounds Read. For this to be exploited, the attacker needs to create a malicious file. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need special privileges or complex steps. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker doesn't need any special privileges. The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a file, so PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The user has to open the malicious file. If the user is required to open it, then UI is Required (R). But sometimes, if the file is automatically processed, maybe UI is None. However, the description says \"when parsed through Autodesk Navisworks\"—so the user would have to open the file, which requires user interaction. So UI: R. Wait, but sometimes, if the application is running and the file is processed without user action, maybe UI is None. But the description doesn't specify. However, in many cases, such vulnerabilities require the user to open the file, so UI is Required. But I need to check. For example, if the file is opened via a link or an email attachment, that's user interaction. But if the application is running and the file is processed automatically, maybe not. Since the description is vague, but the default for UI is None (N) if the attack can be done without user interaction. Wait, the CVSS guidelines say that if the attack requires user interaction, then UI is R. Otherwise, it's N. Since the user has to open the file, which is a user action, UI is R. So PR: N, UI: R.\n\nScope (S). The scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges or access a different component. In this case, the vulnerability allows reading sensitive data or executing code, which could be a different scope. So S: C.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows reading sensitive data, so that's High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). If the attacker can modify data, then I is High. But the description mentions Out-of-Bounds Read, which is about reading, not writing. However, if the attacker can overwrite memory, that could lead to code execution, which affects integrity. But the description says \"read sensitive data\" and \"execute arbitrary code\". So for Integrity, if the attacker can modify data, then I is High. But the initial vulnerability is a read, but the exploit could lead to code execution, which would affect integrity. However, the base metric for Integrity is about the ability to modify data. Since the description mentions \"execute arbitrary code\", which is more about integrity (since code execution can alter the system's state), but maybe the base metric for I is High. Alternatively, if the vulnerability only allows reading, then I is None. But the description says the attacker can cause a crash, read data, or execute code. So the code execution would affect integrity. Therefore, I: H.\n\nAvailability (A). The vulnerability can cause a crash, which affects availability. So A: H.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The base metrics are for the impact of the vulnerability. For example, if the vulnerability allows reading data (C:H), executing code (I:H), and causing a crash (A:H). So all three are High. But the scope is Changed (C) because the attack can affect a different component (like executing code, which is a different scope than just reading data). So the base metrics would be:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: C (Changed)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: H (High)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about UI. If the user has to open the file, that's user interaction. So UI: R. But sometimes, if the file is processed automatically, like a web app that parses files without user interaction, then UI is N. But the description doesn't specify. However, the default for UI is N unless the attack requires user interaction. Since the user has to open the file, which is a user action, UI is R. So that's correct.\n\nAnother point: Scope (S) is Changed if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges or access a different component. In this case, the attacker can execute code, which is a different component (like the process itself), so the scope is Changed. Therefore, S: C.\n\nSo putting it all together, the vector is as above. Let me check if that's correct.

It triggers a NULL pointer dereference in the periodic tick code. This happens because the legacy timer interrupt (IRQ0) is resent in software which happens in soft interrupt (tasklet) context. In this context get_irq_regs() returns NULL which leads to the NULL pointer dereference. The reason for the resend is a spurious APIC interrupt on the IRQ0 vector which is captured and leads to a resend when the legacy timer interrupt is enabled. This is wrong because the legacy PIC interrupts are level triggered and therefore should never be resent in software, but nothing ever sets the IRQ_LEVEL flag on those interrupts, so the core code does not know about their trigger type. Ensure that IRQ_LEVEL is set when the legacy PCI interrupts are set up.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the x86/i8259 component. The issue is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a spurious APIC interrupt on IRQ0, which is a legacy PIC interrupt. The problem arises because the IRQ_LEVEL flag isn't set for these interrupts, leading to incorrect software resending of the interrupt in a tasklet context where get_irq_regs() returns NULL.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is triggered when a spurious APIC interrupt occurs, which is a hardware-level event. However, the actual exploitation might require the attacker to have access to the system's hardware, but since it's a kernel-level issue, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the vulnerability is in the kernel code that runs in privileged mode. Wait, but the attack vector could be Network (N) if the exploit is triggered remotely. However, the description doesn't mention remote exploitation. The issue is related to a hardware interrupt that's handled by the kernel. Since the attack is not through a network but rather through a local hardware event, AV is probably Local (L). Wait, but the attack vector is how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be on the same system, then AV is Local. But if the vulnerability can be triggered remotely, then it's Network. The description doesn't mention remote exploitation, so AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity here is whether the attack requires multiple steps or is straightforward. The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference that occurs due to a specific hardware event. The attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps; it's a result of a specific condition. So Attack Complexity is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have kernel privileges. However, the description doesn't mention that the attacker needs to have elevated privileges. The issue is that the kernel code doesn't set the IRQ_LEVEL flag, which is a configuration error. So the attacker might not need any privileges to trigger this, but since it's a kernel-level issue, maybe PR is None (N) because the vulnerability can be triggered without requiring any specific privileges. Wait, but the attacker would need to have access to the system to trigger the spurious interrupt. However, the PR metric refers to the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without needing to be authenticated or have any privileges, then PR is None (N). But if the attacker needs to be in kernel mode, then PR is High (H). However, the vulnerability is a kernel bug, so the attacker would need to have some level of access. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attacker would need to have some level of access, but the PR is about the privileges required to exploit it. If the attacker can exploit it without needing to be authenticated, then PR is None. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The PR metric is about the level of privileges the attacker needs to have before exploiting the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without any privileges (like a local user), then PR is Low (L) or None (N). Wait, the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). For example, if the attacker needs to be a local user (which is the default), then PR is Low (L). But if the attacker needs to be root, then it's High (H). In this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have some level of access. However, the description doesn't specify that the attacker needs to have elevated privileges. The issue is that the kernel code doesn't set the IRQ_LEVEL flag, which is a configuration error. So the attacker might not need any specific privileges to trigger this. Therefore, PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered by a spurious APIC interrupt, which is an automatic hardware event. The user doesn't need to interact with the system for the attack to occur. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope refers to whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. In this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on the system's availability (due to the NULL pointer dereference leading to a crash). However, the scope is Unchanged (U) if the attack affects the same component (like the kernel) and Changed (C) if it affects a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the impact is on the kernel's functionality, the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability leads to a NULL pointer dereference, which could cause a crash. However, the description doesn't mention any data being exposed. So Confidentiality is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability could allow an attacker to modify the system's state, but the description doesn't mention any integrity issues. The main issue is a crash, which affects availability. So Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability causes a crash, which affects the system's availability. The NULL pointer dereference leads to a crash, so Availability is High (H).\n\nWait, but the description says that the crash-kernel fails to boot about half the time. So the availability impact is High (H) because the system can't boot properly, leading to downtime. So A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) - because the attack is triggered by a hardware event that requires local access to the system.\nAC: Low (L) - the attack is straightforward once the conditions are met.\nPR: None (N) - the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges to trigger the vulnerability.\nUI: None (N) - no user interaction is required.\nS: Unchanged (U) - the attack affects the same component (kernel).\nC: None (N) - no confidentiality impact.\nI: None (N) - no integrity impact.\nA: High (H) - the system crashes, affecting availability.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but I need to check again. Let me re-examine the attack vector. The vulnerability is in the kernel, but the attack vector is how the attacker can exploit it. If the attacker can trigger the spurious interrupt, which is a hardware event, but the attacker would need to be on the same system. So AV is Local (L). But if the attack is through a network, then AV is Network (N). However, the description doesn't mention any network-based exploitation. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAnother point: the attack vector is the method by which the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. Since the vulnerability is triggered by a hardware interrupt, which is a local event, AV is Local (L). So the initial assessment holds.\n\nTherefore, the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.7000000000000002, "success": true}

The user provided a CVE description about a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in version 3.25.0 of aimhubio/aim. The issue is that the tracking server overrides the maximum size for WebSocket messages, allowing very large images, which makes the server unresponsive to other requests.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is related to WebSocket messages. Since the server is handling WebSocket connections, which are typically over the network, the attack vector is likely Network (N). The attacker would need to send a large message over the network to trigger the DoS. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says the server overrides the maximum size. This seems like a low complexity because the attacker doesn't need to perform any special steps beyond sending a large message. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any prior privileges. They just need to send a message to the server. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The DoS is triggered by the server processing the message. There's no mention of needing user interaction, so UI:N.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the server) and doesn't change the scope. The DoS is within the same scope, so S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The DoS doesn't directly affect confidentiality. The server becomes unresponsive, but there's no data disclosure mentioned. So C:N.\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the integrity isn't directly impacted. The server's processing is disrupted, but there's no data modification. So I:N.\n\nAvailability (A): The DoS directly affects availability by making the server unresponsive. So A:H.\n\nPutting it all together, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Wait, but the user's example had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the DoS is a denial of service, which affects availability. So A:H. But what about confidentiality and integrity? The problem is that the server becomes unresponsive, but does that affect confidentiality or integrity? The description says the server becomes unresponsive to other requests. So maybe the attacker can prevent other users from accessing the service, which is availability. But confidentiality and integrity aren't directly impacted. So C:N, I:N, A:H. But sometimes, DoS can be considered as affecting availability, but maybe the user expects C:H or I:H? Wait, the example given in the problem's final line example has C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. Let me think again.\n\nThe original CVE description says the server becomes unresponsive to other requests while processing the large image. So the availability is impacted (A:H). Confidentiality and integrity are not directly affected. So C:N, I:N. But maybe the DoS could be considered as a high impact on availability. So the final vector would be AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. But I need to check if the DoS is considered as a high impact on availability. Yes, because the service is unavailable. So A:H. So the answer should be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the example in the problem's final line has C:H, I:H, A:H. Maybe the user expects that the DoS is considered as high impact on all three? No, that's not correct. The DoS is an availability issue. So the correct values are C:N, I:N, A:H. So the vector string would be as above. Let me confirm each metric again.\n\nAttack Vector: Network (N) because the attack is over the network via WebSocket.\n\nAttack Complexity: Low (L) because the attacker just sends a large message.\n\nPrivileges Required: None (N) because no prior access is needed.\n\nUser Interaction: None (N) because the attack is automated.\n\nScope: Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability is within the same component.\n\nConfidentiality: None (N) because no data is disclosed.\n\nIntegrity: None (N) because no data is modified.\n\nAvailability: High (H) because the service is unavailable.\n\nSo the final vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the example given in the problem's final line example has C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. The actual answer here should be based on the given CVE description.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary log files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in the WooCommerce plugin. The main issue is a Directory Traversal vulnerability that allows authenticated attackers with Administrator-level access to read arbitrary log files. \n\nFirst, I need to break down each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the download_file() function. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have admin access, they would have to be on the same network or have local access. Wait, but the description says \"authenticated attackers with Administrator-level access\". So the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the system. But wait, if the attack is through a web interface, maybe it's Network (N)? Hmm, but the user has to be authenticated, so maybe it's Local. Wait, the attack vector is how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is on the same network, it's Network. If they need to be logged in, it's Local. But the description says \"authenticated attackers\", so they have to be logged in. So AV is Local (L)? Or maybe Adjacent (A)? Wait, Adjacent is for attacks that require physical proximity or local network. But if the attack is via the web, maybe it's Network. Wait, the vulnerability is in a function that's part of the plugin, so the attacker would need to be on the same network or have access to the server. But since the attacker is authenticated, maybe it's Local. Wait, the CVSS defines AV as Network (N) if the attack can be done remotely, Local (L) if it requires local access. Since the attacker is authenticated, they can access the system via the web, so it's Network? Or is it Local? I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS definitions again. Attack Vector (AV) is the method by which the vulnerability is exploited. If the attacker can exploit it remotely without needing to be on the same network, it's Network. If they need to be on the same network, it's Adjacent. If they need physical access, it's Physical. If they need to be logged in, it's Local. Wait, no. The AV metric is about the path to the vulnerability. For example, if the vulnerability is in a web application, then the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can exploit it remotely. But if the attacker needs to be on the same network, it's Adjacent. But in this case, the attacker is authenticated, so they can access the system via the web. So the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can exploit it remotely. Wait, but the user has to be authenticated. So maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be logged in. Wait, the CVSS defines AV as follows: Network (N) - attack is delivered over a network, Local (L) - attack requires local access. So if the attacker is on the same network, it's Network. If they need to be on the same system, it's Local. But in this case, the attacker is authenticated, so they can access the system via the web. So the attack vector is Network (N). But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the download_file() function. If the attacker can access the web interface, they can exploit it. So the attack is via the network, so AV is Network (N). But the attacker needs to be authenticated, so maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because they need to be logged in. Wait, the CVSS defines AV as the method by which the attack is delivered. If the attack is done over the network, it's N. If it's done via local access, it's L. So if the attacker is authenticated, they can access the system via the web, which is a network attack. So AV is Network (N). But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check some examples. For example, if a vulnerability allows an authenticated user to read files, the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker has to be logged in. Wait, but the attack is done over the network. Hmm. Maybe the answer is Network (N) because the attack is done remotely. But the attacker needs to be authenticated. So the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can exploit it remotely, but requires authentication. So AV is Network (N). \n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says that the attacker needs to be authenticated and have admin access. So the attack complexity is High (H) because the attacker needs to have certain privileges. Wait, the AC metric is about the complexity of the attack. If the attack requires the attacker to have certain privileges, that's part of PR (Privileges Required). Wait, AC is about the complexity of the attack, not the privileges. For example, if the attack requires the attacker to have specific knowledge or steps, it's High. But in this case, the attack is a Directory Traversal, which might be a low complexity attack. Wait, the attack complexity is Low (L) if the attack can be done with minimal effort, High (H) if it requires more steps. Since the attacker can exploit the vulnerability by just accessing the web interface with admin credentials, the complexity is Low (L). So AC is Low (L). \n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be authenticated and have Administrator-level access. So PR is High (H) because the attacker needs to have elevated privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have a certain level of access, like admin, then PR is High (H). So PR is High (H). \n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says the attacker is authenticated, so the attack doesn't require user interaction. So UI is None (N). \n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows reading log files, which is a different component (the log files). So the scope is Changed (C) because the attack affects a different component (the log files) than the one being exploited. Wait, the original component is the plugin, and the attack allows reading log files, which are part of the server. So the scope is Changed (C). \n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can read sensitive information from log files, so Confidentiality is High (H). \n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability doesn't allow modifying data, so Integrity is None (N). \n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't affect availability, so Availability is None (N). \n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:H, UI:N, S:C, C:H, I:N, A:N. \n\nWait, but the user is authenticated, so PR is High (H) because the attacker needs to have admin access. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's part of the PR. Wait, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's part of the PR. Wait, the PR options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to have a certain level of access, like admin, then PR is High (H). So yes, PR is High (H). \n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the Scope. If the vulnerability is in the plugin, and the attack allows reading log files, which are part of the server, then the scope is Changed (C). Because the attack affects a different component (the log files) than the one being exploited (the plugin). So S:C. \n\nBut I need to confirm. The Scope metric is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. If the attack affects the same component (like the plugin's data), then S:U. If it affects a different component (like the server's log files), then S:C. So in this case, the attacker can read log files, which are part of the server, so the scope is Changed (C). \n\nSo the final vector is as above.

Starting in version 14.0.0 and prior to versions 14.3.2 and 15.1.2, authenticated users are able to exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability when viewing certain localized backoffice components. Versions 14.3.2 and 15.1.2 contain a patch.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The issue is in Umbraco, a.NET CMS. The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw that allows authenticated users to exploit it when viewing localized backoffice components. The affected versions are from 14.0.0 up to 14.3.1 and 15.1.1, with patches in 14.3.2 and 15.1.2.\n\nSo, the main points here are: authenticated users can exploit XSS. Let's break down the CVSS metrics one by one.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the backoffice components, which are typically accessed via the web interface. Since the user is authenticated, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated to access the backoffice. Wait, but wait—XSS usually involves the attacker injecting code into the web page, which is then executed by the user's browser. However, in this case, the user is authenticated, so the attack vector might be Network (N) because the exploit is delivered through the network (web interface) but requires authentication. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The attack vector refers to how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable component, then the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is already authenticated and can access the system. But if the attack is delivered via the network (like a web page), then it's Network (N). Wait, the user is authenticated, so the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is already logged in. But maybe the attack vector is Network (N) because the exploit is delivered through the network. I need to check the CVSS definitions. According to CVSS, Attack Vector (AV) is the method by which the vulnerability is exploited. If the attack requires the attacker to be authenticated, then AV is Local (L) because the attacker is already on the system. But if the attack is delivered via the network (like a web page), then it's Network (N). Wait, the user is authenticated, so the attacker has to be authenticated. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is already on the system. But maybe the attack is delivered through the network, so AV is Network (N). I'm a bit confused here. Let me check examples. For example, if a vulnerability is in a web application and requires the attacker to be authenticated, the AV is Local (L) because the attacker is already logged in. But if the attack is delivered via the network (like a web page), then AV is Network (N). Wait, the attack vector is about how the attacker can reach the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, then the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is already on the system. But if the attack is delivered through the network (like a web page), then it's Network (N). Hmm. Let me think again. The user is authenticated, so the attacker has to be authenticated. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is already on the system. But maybe the attack is delivered via the network, so AV is Network (N). I think in this case, since the user is authenticated, the attack vector is Local (L). But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check the CVSS documentation. According to the CVSS v3.1 specification, Attack Vector (AV) is the method by which the vulnerability is exploited. If the attack requires the attacker to be authenticated, then AV is Local (L). If the attack can be exploited without authentication, then AV is Network (N). Wait, no. Wait, the Attack Vector is about the path the attacker takes to exploit the vulnerability. For example, if the vulnerability is in a web application and the attacker can exploit it via the network (like a web page), then AV is Network (N). If the attacker needs to be on the same physical machine (like a local exploit), then AV is Local (L). But in this case, the attacker is authenticated, so they can access the backoffice. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is already authenticated and can access the system. But maybe the attack is delivered through the network, so AV is Network (N). I think the correct answer here is Network (N) because the exploit is delivered through the web interface (network), but requires authentication. Wait, but the attack vector is about the method of exploitation. If the attacker is already authenticated, then the attack vector is Local (L). But I'm not sure. Let me think of another example. If a vulnerability allows an authenticated user to execute code on the server, then AV is Local (L). But if the vulnerability is an XSS that allows an attacker to inject code into a web page, which is then executed by the user's browser, then the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can deliver the payload through the network. So in this case, the XSS is a network-based attack. Therefore, AV is Network (N). So I think AV is Network (N).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says that authenticated users can exploit the vulnerability. The complexity here is whether the attack requires any special conditions. Since the user is already authenticated, the attack complexity is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to perform any additional steps beyond being authenticated. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be authenticated, so PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have user credentials. Wait, but PR is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, then PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have user privileges. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says that the vulnerability is exploited when viewing certain localized backoffice components. If the user interaction is required, then UI is Required (R). But in XSS, the user typically has to click on a malicious link or visit a malicious page. However, in this case, the user is already authenticated and viewing the backoffice components. So the user interaction might be required. Wait, but the user is already authenticated, so the attack might not require any additional user interaction. Wait, the user is viewing the backoffice components, which are part of the application. So the user is already logged in, and the attack is triggered when they view the components. So the user interaction is not required. Therefore, UI is None (N). Wait, but in XSS, the user has to click on a malicious link. However, in this case, the user is already authenticated, so the attack might be triggered automatically when they access the component. So UI is None (N). But I'm not sure. Let me think again. If the user is already authenticated and the attack is triggered when they access the component, then no user interaction is required. So UI is None (N). But if the user has to click on a malicious link, then UI is Required (R). However, the description says that the user is able to exploit the vulnerability when viewing certain components. So the user is already logged in, and the attack is triggered when they view the component. Therefore, no additional user interaction is required. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope refers to whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the backoffice components, and the attack is XSS, which affects the user's browser, the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't affect other components. Wait, but if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability to gain higher privileges, then the scope would be Changed (C). However, in this case, the vulnerability is XSS, which is a confidentiality issue (exposing data) or integrity (modifying data). Since the user is authenticated, the attack might not change the scope. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): XSS can allow the attacker to steal data from the user's session, so confidentiality is High (H). But if the attacker can't steal data, then it's Low (L). The description says it's a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which typically allows the attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which can steal cookies or other data. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): If the attacker can modify data, then I is High (H). But in XSS, the attacker can inject scripts, which might allow them to modify data if the page is editable. However, the description doesn't specify that. Since it's a backoffice component, maybe the attacker can modify data. But the description says \"viewing certain localized backoffice components,\" so maybe the attack is about viewing, not modifying. However, XSS can be used to modify data. But without more info, I think the default for XSS is that it can affect integrity. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability is XSS, which doesn't directly affect availability. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Network (N)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: Low (L)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: High (H)\nI: High (H)\nA: None (N)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but I need to check again. Let me verify each metric again.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The attack is delivered through the network (web interface), so AV is Network (N).

This could lead to local escalation of privilege if a malicious actor has already obtained the System privilege. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS09625562; Issue ID: MSV-3027.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about an out-of-bounds write in scp, which could lead to local privilege escalation if the attacker already has system privileges. No user interaction is needed. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in scp, which is a command-line utility for secure file transfer. The out-of-bounds write is due to a missing bounds check. Since the attacker needs to have already obtained system privileges, the attack vector is likely Local (L). Because the exploit requires local access to the system, not network or adjacent. So AV:L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The description mentions a missing bounds check. If the exploit is straightforward once the attacker has local access, then the complexity is Low (L). Because the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps beyond exploiting the vulnerability. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The problem states that the escalation is possible if the attacker already has system privilege. So the attacker needs to have already obtained system privileges. Therefore, the privileges required are High (H) because the attacker must already be at a high privilege level to exploit this. Wait, but the question is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker already has system privileges, then the PR would be High because they need to have that privilege to exploit. But maybe the PR is Low if the exploit doesn't require any additional privileges beyond what's already there. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker already has system privileges, then the PR is High because they need to have that privilege to exploit. But maybe the PR is None (N) if the exploit doesn't require any additional privileges. Wait, the description says \"if a malicious actor has already obtained the System privilege.\" So the attacker must already have system privileges to exploit this. Therefore, the PR is High (H) because the attacker needs to have high privileges to exploit the vulnerability. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker already has system privileges, then the PR is High because they need to have that privilege. But maybe the PR is Low if the exploit doesn't require any additional privileges beyond what's already there. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the CVSS definitions. PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have system privileges to exploit, then PR is High. But if the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, then it's None. In this case, the attacker must already have system privilege to exploit, so PR is High. So PR:H.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says user interaction is not needed. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain a different privilege level. Since the vulnerability allows local escalation of privilege, the scope is Changed (C). Because the attacker can go from a lower privilege level (like user) to a higher one (system). Wait, but the description says the attacker already has system privilege. Wait, the description says \"if a malicious actor has already obtained the System privilege.\" So the attacker is already at system level. So the scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't change the scope. Wait, no. The scope is about whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component or privilege level. If the attacker is already at system level, then the vulnerability doesn't change the scope. But if the vulnerability allows escalation from a lower privilege to higher, then the scope is Changed. But in this case, the attacker already has system privilege. So the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but the problem says \"local escalation of privilege if a malicious actor has already obtained the System privilege.\" So the attacker is already at system level. Therefore, the scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to gain a different privilege level. Wait, but the vulnerability is about escalation. If the attacker is already at system level, then the vulnerability doesn't allow them to escalate further. So the scope is Unchanged. Therefore, S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, which could lead to privilege escalation. But does it affect confidentiality? If the attacker can overwrite memory, maybe they can access sensitive data. However, the description doesn't mention confidentiality loss. So C:None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I). The vulnerability allows local escalation of privilege. If the attacker can escalate, they can modify system files or data, which affects integrity. So I:High (H).\n\nAvailability (A). The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, which could cause a crash or denial of service. But the description doesn't mention availability impact. So A:None (N).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"local escalation of privilege\". So the attacker can gain higher privileges, which would affect integrity (since they can modify system data) and maybe availability if the system crashes. But the description doesn't mention availability. So maybe A:None. But if the out-of-bounds write could lead to a crash, then A:High. However, the description doesn't specify that. So I think the answer is A:None.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:L (Local), AC:L (Low complexity), PR:H (High privileges required), UI:N (No user interaction), S:U (Scope unchanged), C:N (No confidentiality), I:H (High integrity), A:N (No availability).\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but the user's example had C:H, I:H, A:H. But in this case, the description doesn't mention confidentiality or availability. So maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write. If the attacker can overwrite memory, they might be able to modify data structures, leading to integrity issues. So I:H. But confidentiality? If the attacker can overwrite data, maybe they can access other data, but the description doesn't mention that. So C:N. Availability: if the exploit causes a crash, then A:H. But the description doesn't mention that. So maybe A:N. But the example in the user's prompt had A:H. Wait, the example given by the user was Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. But that's just an example. So in our case, the answer would be based on the given CVE description.\n\nSo, the final vector would be:\n\nAV:L, AC:L, PR:H, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:H, A:N.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me recheck each metric.\n\nAttack Vector: Local (L) because the attacker needs to be on the same system.\n\nAttack Complexity: Low (L) because the exploit is straightforward once local access is obtained.\n\nPrivileges Required: High (H) because the attacker must already have system privileges to exploit the vulnerability.\n\nUser Interaction: None (N) as stated.\n\nScope: Unchanged (U) because the attacker is already at system level, so the scope doesn't change.\n\nConfidentiality: None (N) because the description doesn't mention data exposure.\n\nIntegrity: High (H) because the attacker can escalate privileges, which allows modification of system data.\n\nAvailability: None (N) because the description doesn't mention denial of service.\n\nSo the vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N.\n\nBut wait, the example in the user's prompt had C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. The actual answer depends on the CVE description. In this case, the description doesn't mention confidentiality or availability, so they are N. But maybe the out-of-bounds write could lead to data corruption, which affects integrity. So I:H. Availability is not mentioned, so A:N.

Add a null point check to avoid the Kernel Oops.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a Linux kernel vulnerability in the Bluetooth driver. The issue is that if an USB dongle with a chip not in the ic_id_table is inserted, it causes a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a Kernel Oops. The fix is adding a null check.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is triggered by inserting an USB dongle. Since the USB is a local device, the attack vector is Local (L). But wait, could it be Network? No, because the USB is a physical connection. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability requires the attacker to insert a specific USB dongle. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need special tools or knowledge beyond inserting the dongle. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any privileges to insert the USB dongle. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attacker needs to physically insert the dongle, which might require some user action, but the description doesn't mention any user interaction beyond that. However, in CVSS, if the attack requires user interaction, like clicking a link, then UI is R. But here, inserting a USB is a physical action, which might be considered as requiring user interaction. Wait, but the UI metric is about whether the user has to interact with the system. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any user action, then UI is N. But inserting a USB might be considered as a physical action, but the user might have to do it. However, in some contexts, physical access is considered as a separate vector (AV: Physical). Wait, the AV here is Local (L), which is for local access. So the user interaction here is not required beyond the physical insertion. But the UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any user interaction, then UI is N. But inserting the USB might be considered as a user action. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. The UI metric is \"whether the attack requires user interaction to be successful.\" If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any user interaction, then UI is N. If the user has to perform some action (like clicking a link), then UI is R. In this case, inserting the USB is a physical action, but the user might have to do it. However, in the context of the kernel, the user might be the attacker, so inserting the USB is part of the attack. But the UI metric is about whether the user (the victim) has to interact. If the attacker can exploit it without the user's interaction, then UI is N. Since the attacker is inserting the USB, which is a physical action, but the user (victim) might not be involved. Wait, maybe the UI is N because the attacker can do it without the user's interaction. So UI is N.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the kernel, which is a critical component. The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges. Since the vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference leading to a kernel panic, which could potentially allow escalation, but the description doesn't mention that. The scope is Unchanged (U) if the attack doesn't change the scope. If the attack can be used to gain higher privileges, then scope is Changed (C). But the description doesn't mention privilege escalation. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability causes a kernel panic, which might lead to data exposure, but the description doesn't specify. However, a NULL pointer dereference could lead to information leakage. But since the description doesn't mention confidentiality impact, maybe it's None (N). Wait, but the kernel panic could allow an attacker to crash the system, which might be considered as a denial of service, but not directly affecting confidentiality. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the vulnerability could allow the attacker to modify kernel data structures if they can exploit the NULL pointer. But the description doesn't mention that. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The kernel panic would cause a denial of service, so the availability is High (H). Because the system crashes, making it unavailable.\n\nWait, but the description says \"Kernel Oops\" which is a panic. So the availability impact is High. So A is H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nBut wait, maybe the integrity is High? If the attacker can modify kernel data structures, but the description doesn't mention that. The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which could lead to a crash, but not necessarily modifying data. So I think I is N.\n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nBut wait, the user might have to insert the USB, which is a physical action. But the UI metric is about user interaction. If the attacker can insert the USB without the user's interaction, then UI is N. But if the user has to insert it, then UI is R. However, in the context of the kernel, the user might be the attacker, so inserting the USB is part of the attack. But the UI metric is about whether the user (victim) has to interact. If the attacker can do it without the user's interaction, then UI is N. So I think UI is N.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS guidelines again. The UI metric is \"whether the attack requires user interaction to be successful.\" If the attack requires the user to perform some action (like clicking a link), then UI is R. If the attack can be done without user interaction, then UI is N. In this case, inserting the USB is a physical action. If the attacker has physical access, then they can insert the USB without needing the user's interaction. So UI is N.\n\nSo the final vector is as above. But I need to make sure about the scope. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, then scope is Changed. But the description doesn't mention that. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\n**Metric Justifications:**\n- **AV:L** (Local): The vulnerability requires physical access to insert the USB dongle, which is a local attack vector.\n- **AC:L** (Low): The attack is straightforward, requiring no special tools or knowledge beyond inserting the dongle.\n- **PR:N** (None): No privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.\n- **UI:N** (None): The attack does not require user interaction beyond inserting the USB device.\n- **S:U** (Unchanged): The vulnerability does not allow privilege escalation or scope change.\n- **C:N** (None): No confidentiality impact is explicitly mentioned.\n- **I:N** (None): No integrity impact is explicitly mentioned.\n- **A:H** (High): The vulnerability causes a kernel panic (Kernel Oops), leading to a denial of service.", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.7000000000000002, "success": true}

Add a NULL check for test_state.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring problem. The user provided a CVE description about a null dereference in the Linux kernel. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, let me recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The ones mentioned are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Each has specific options. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, specifically in a function related to kunit tests. The issue is that kunit_kzalloc() might return NULL, and there's no check, leading to a null dereference. Since this is a kernel vulnerability, the attack vector would be Local (L) because the attacker needs to have local access to the system. But wait, could it be Network (N)? No, because the vulnerability is in the kernel code, and the attacker would need to be running in the kernel context. So AV is Local (L).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires that the attacker can trigger the null dereference by calling the function without checking the return value. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need any special tools or steps beyond invoking the function. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to have local access to the system, but the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to be running in kernel mode or have some privilege. However, the description doesn't mention any specific privilege level. Wait, the vulnerability is in the kernel code, so the attacker would need to be local, but maybe the PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges beyond being local. Wait, but in kernel vulnerabilities, sometimes the attacker needs to have some privilege. Hmm. Let me think. The PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, then maybe PR is None (N) because the attacker is already in the system. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe PR is Low (L) if the attacker needs to have some privilege. Wait, the PR options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). For example, if the attacker needs to be a user with certain privileges, but in this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to be local. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, then maybe PR is None (N) because they don't need any additional privileges beyond being local. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, then they can exploit it without needing any additional privileges. So PR would be None (N). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. For example, if the vulnerability is in a user-space application, then PR would be None (N) if the attacker is a local user. But in kernel vulnerabilities, the attacker is already in the kernel, so maybe PR is None (N). Alternatively, maybe the PR is Low (L) if the attacker needs to have some privilege. But the description doesn't mention any specific privilege level. So I think PR is None (N) because the attacker is already local and doesn't need any additional privileges.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is a null dereference that occurs when the function is called without checking the return value. The attacker doesn't need user interaction; they can trigger it by calling the function. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attack is local, the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope. Wait, the scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect resources beyond those of the component. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, then scope is Changed. But in this case, the vulnerability is a null dereference, which could lead to a crash or denial of service, but not necessarily changing the scope. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability could lead to a crash, but does it affect confidentiality? If the null dereference causes a crash, it might not directly expose confidential data. So C is None (N). Wait, but maybe the crash could be used to escalate privileges, but the description doesn't mention that. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I). Similarly, the vulnerability might not affect integrity. If the crash is a denial of service, then integrity is not affected. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A). The null dereference could lead to a crash, which would affect availability. So A is High (H) because the crash would make the system unavailable.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The vulnerability is a null dereference, which could cause a crash. So the availability impact is High (H) because the system might crash, leading to denial of service. So A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the scope. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attack is local, then the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope. So S:U is correct.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in kernel vulnerabilities, the scope might be Changed (C) if the attack can lead to privilege escalation. However, the description doesn't mention any privilege escalation. The vulnerability is a null dereference, which could lead to a crash, but not necessarily changing the scope. So S:U is correct.\n\nSo the final vector is as above. Let me check again each metric.\n\nAttack Vector: Local (L) because the attacker needs to be local to the system.\n\nAttack Complexity: Low (L) because the attacker can exploit it without any additional steps.\n\nPrivileges Required: None (N) because the attacker is already local.\n\nUser Interaction: None (N) because the attack can be triggered without user interaction.\n\nScope: Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope.\n\nConfidentiality: None (N) because no data is exposed.\n\nIntegrity: None (N) because no data is modified.\n\nAvailability: High (H) because the system could crash, leading to denial of service.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

The user provided a CVE description about a memory leak in the Linux kernel's watch_queue. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, let me recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The ones mentioned are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Each has specific options. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, specifically related to memory management. The description mentions a memory leak when the watch_queue is dismantled. Since the kernel is a critical component, and the vulnerability is in the kernel code, the attack vector would likely be Local (L) because the attacker needs to have local access to exploit it. But wait, could it be Network (N)? Wait, the memory leak is due to a bug in the code, so maybe it's not accessible over the network. The exploit would require local access to the system, so AV should be Local (L). But I need to check if the vulnerability can be exploited remotely. The description doesn't mention any network-based exploitation, so AV is Local.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is a memory leak. The fix was to free the page array. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps. The memory leak is a straightforward issue, so AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker would need to have local access to the system, but the vulnerability is a memory leak. However, the memory leak itself doesn't grant privileges. Wait, but the description says that the bug is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to be able to access the kernel, which typically requires local access. However, the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, then PR is None (N). But in this case, the vulnerability is a memory leak, which might not require any specific privileges. Wait, but the memory leak is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to be in a position to trigger the leak, which might require local access. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already in the system (local), then PR is None (N) because the exploit doesn't require additional privileges beyond what's already present. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The memory leak can be triggered by a local process, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The scope refers to whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is a memory leak in the kernel, and the impact is on the system's memory, the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope of the vulnerability. The memory leak is within the same component (kernel), so S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C). The memory leak could expose sensitive data if the leaked memory contains such information. However, the description doesn't specify that. But since it's a memory leak, the confidentiality impact is High (H) because the attacker could potentially access sensitive data stored in the leaked memory. However, if the leak is just of non-sensitive data, it might be Low. But in the absence of specific info, the default for a memory leak is High. Wait, but the CVSS guidelines for confidentiality: if the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to data, then C is High. Since the memory leak could expose data, C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). The vulnerability is a memory leak, which doesn't directly affect the integrity of the system. The integrity metric is about the ability to modify data. Since the leak doesn't allow modification, I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A). The memory leak could lead to denial of service if the memory is exhausted. However, the description doesn't mention that. But the memory leak could be a resource exhaustion, which would impact availability. However, the CVSS guidelines for availability: if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause denial of service, then A is High. But the description only mentions a memory leak, not necessarily leading to a DoS. However, in the absence of specific info, the default for a memory leak might be High. Wait, but the example given in the CVE description is a memory leak, which could be considered as a resource exhaustion, leading to availability impact. So A is High (H).\n\nWait, but I need to be careful. Let me check each metric again.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): Local (L) because the vulnerability is in the kernel, requiring local access.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L) because the exploit is straightforward.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N) because the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges, just local access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): None (N) because the exploit can be triggered without user interaction.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't affect a different component.\n\nConfidentiality (C): High (H) because the memory leak could expose sensitive data.\n\nIntegrity (I): None (N) because the leak doesn't allow modification of data.\n\nAvailability (A): High (H) because the memory leak could lead to resource exhaustion, affecting availability.\n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm the availability. If the memory leak is just a leak and not leading to a DoS, then maybe A is None. But the description mentions a memory leak that could be a resource issue. However, the CVSS guidelines for availability: if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause denial of service, then A is High. Since the memory leak could lead to memory exhaustion, which is a DoS, then A is High. So the answer would have A as High.\n\nSo the final vector is AV:L, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:H.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 2.2, "success": true}

Prior to version 5.1.15, an incorrect input validation could allow an authenticated user to read sensitive information, including login token or other content stored in the database. This could lead to privilege escalation if cookies are enabled (default setting). Users must upgrade to eLabFTW version 5.1.15 to receive a fix. No known workarounds are available.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in eLabFTW, an open-source lab notebook. Before version 5.1.15, there's an issue with input validation that allows an authenticated user to read sensitive info like login tokens or other database content. This could lead to privilege escalation if cookies are enabled (which is the default). Users need to upgrade to fix it. No workarounds.\n\nSo, the main points here are: authenticated user can access sensitive data, which might lead to privilege escalation. Let's break down the CVSS metrics.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The user is authenticated, so the attack is happening through the application, which is a local attack. Wait, but the user is authenticated, so maybe it's local? Or is it network? Wait, the user is already authenticated, so the attack vector is local because the attacker needs to be authenticated. But wait, the input validation is incorrect, so maybe the attacker can exploit this through the application's interface. So AV would be Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated and access the system locally. But wait, if the user is authenticated, maybe the attack vector is Local. But sometimes, if the attack can be done via network, but here the user is already authenticated. Hmm. Let me think again. The user is authenticated, so the attack is within the system, so AV is Local. So AV: L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The input validation is incorrect. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any special steps beyond exploiting the input validation flaw. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The user is authenticated, so the attacker needs to have an account. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated, but not necessarily elevated privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since the user is already authenticated, the attacker needs to have that account, which is a low privilege requirement. So PR: L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says that the user must be authenticated, but does it require any user interaction? The problem is that the user is already authenticated, so maybe the attack doesn't require any additional user interaction. The user is already logged in, so the attack is automatic. So UI: None (N).\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability affects a different component. The description says that the attack could lead to privilege escalation. Privilege escalation implies that the scope is Changed (C) because the attacker can gain higher privileges than the original user. So S: C.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows reading sensitive information, which is a high confidentiality impact. So C: H.\n\nIntegrity (I). The description doesn't mention any modification of data, just reading. So I: N.\n\nAvailability (A). No mention of availability issues, so A: N.\n\nWait, but the problem says that this could lead to privilege escalation. Privilege escalation is a change in scope. So the scope is Changed (C). So the base metrics would be:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: C (Changed)\nC: H (High)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but let me check again. The user is authenticated, so the attack vector is Local. The attack complexity is low because the input validation is incorrect, which is a simple exploit. Privileges required are low because the attacker needs to be authenticated. User interaction is none because the user is already logged in. Scope is changed because the attack could lead to privilege escalation. Confidentiality is high because sensitive data is read. Integrity and Availability are not affected. So the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the scope. The scope is Changed if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges. Since the description mentions that this could lead to privilege escalation, that's a change in scope. So S: C. So the vector would have S:C. \n\nBut wait, the original problem says that the user is authenticated and can read sensitive info. The privilege escalation part is if cookies are enabled. So maybe the attacker can escalate their privileges. So the scope is changed. Therefore, the base score would have S:C. \n\nSo putting it all together, the vector is AV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:C, C:H, I:N, A:N. \n\nBut wait, the answer example in the prompt shows a different vector. Let me check again. The example given is Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. But that's just an example. \n\nSo for this case, the correct vector would be AV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:C, C:H, I:N, A:N. \n\nWait, but maybe the scope is unchanged? Let me think again. The scope is Changed if the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, then the scope is Changed. In this case, the vulnerability allows reading sensitive data, which could lead to privilege escalation. So the scope is Changed. Therefore, S:C. \n\nSo the final vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N. \n\nBut I need to make sure about each metric.

The user provided a CVE description about a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IBM Jazz Foundation.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting issue. XSS typically allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Since this is a web-based attack, the attack vector is usually Network (N) because the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network, not requiring physical access or local access. So AV:N makes sense here.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). For XSS, the complexity is usually low because the attacker doesn't need special tools or knowledge beyond injecting the script. The exploit can be done with a simple script, so AC:L is appropriate.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The description says the vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript. If the user is already authenticated, they might be able to exploit this. However, the question is whether the attacker needs to have some privileges. Since the user is already logged in, maybe PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated. Wait, but in some cases, if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing any prior privileges, it might be N. Wait, the description says \"users\" can embed code, so maybe the attacker is a user who is already authenticated. So PR would be Low (L) because the attacker needs to have user privileges to exploit it. But I need to check. For example, if the vulnerability is in the web UI, the attacker might need to be logged in as a user. So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). XSS often requires some user interaction, like clicking a malicious link. However, the description says \"users can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI\". Wait, the vulnerability allows users to embed code, which might mean that the attacker can inject the script into the UI, which could be done without user interaction if the attacker can manipulate the input. But in typical XSS, the user has to click on a malicious link or visit a malicious page. However, the description says \"users can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI\", which might imply that the attacker can inject the code into the UI, which could be done through a crafted input. But if the attacker can do this without the user's interaction, like through a malicious link, then UI would be None (N). Wait, but the description says \"users\" can embed the code. Maybe the attacker is a user who is already authenticated. So maybe the user interaction is required. Wait, the description says \"users can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI\". So perhaps the attacker is a user who is already logged in, and they can inject the code. But in that case, the user interaction might not be required. Wait, maybe the user is the one who is interacting with the UI, but the attacker is another user. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. For XSS, the attacker can inject code into the web page, and when another user visits the page, the code executes. So the user interaction is required for the exploit to work. But in the case of stored XSS, the attacker can inject the code into the site, and then any user who visits that page will be affected. So in that case, the user interaction is required. However, if the attacker can inject the code into the UI, maybe the user interaction is not required. Wait, the description says \"users can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI\". So maybe the attacker is a user who is already authenticated, and they can inject the code. But the user interaction here might be required for the attacker to perform the injection. Wait, the user interaction metric refers to whether the user has to interact with the exploit. For example, if the exploit requires the user to click a link, then UI:R. If the exploit can be triggered automatically, then UI:N. In this case, the vulnerability allows users to embed code, which might be done through a malicious input. So if the attacker can inject the code into the UI, then the user might not need to interact. But if the code is injected into a page that the user is viewing, then the user interaction is required. Wait, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the standard for XSS. Typically, XSS vulnerabilities can be either reflected or stored. Reflected XSS requires the user to click a malicious link, so UI:R. Stored XSS is when the attacker injects code into the site, and when other users visit the page, the code is executed. In that case, the user interaction is required for the exploit to work. However, the description here says \"users can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI\", which might imply that the attacker is a user who is already authenticated and can inject the code. So maybe the user interaction is not required. Wait, but the attacker needs to have access to the UI to inject the code. So if the attacker is a user, they can inject the code without needing the user to interact. But the user interaction metric is about whether the user (the victim) has to interact with the exploit. So if the attacker injects the code into the UI, and then the victim visits the page, the code is executed. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI:R. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the attacker can inject the code into the UI without the user's interaction, like through a form submission, then UI:N. But the description says \"users can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI\", which might mean that the attacker is a user who is already logged in and can inject the code. So the user interaction might not be required. Wait, but the user interaction metric is about the victim's interaction. So if the attacker can inject the code into the UI, and then the victim's browser executes it when they visit the page, then the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI:R. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me check some examples. For example, a reflected XSS would have UI:R. Stored XSS would also have UI:R because the user has to visit the page. So in this case, the vulnerability is a cross-site scripting, which is typically UI:R. So I think UI:R is correct here.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to elevate privileges. Since the vulnerability is XSS, which is a web UI issue, the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't allow the attacker to gain higher privileges. The attacker can only affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the user's session. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows the attacker to alter the intended functionality and potentially lead to credentials disclosure. So the attacker can steal session cookies or other sensitive information, which affects confidentiality. Therefore, C:High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can alter the functionality, which could lead to changing data or user actions. So the integrity is affected. Therefore, I:High (H).\n\nAvailability (A). The description doesn't mention any impact on availability, like denial of service. So A:None (N).\n\nWait, but let me check again. The description says \"altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.\" So the main impact is on confidentiality (credentials disclosure) and possibly integrity (altering functionality). Availability isn't mentioned. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:L (Low), UI:R (Required), S:U (Unchanged), C:H (High), I:H (High), A:N (None).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought UI might be N. Let me recheck. If the attacker can inject the code into the UI without requiring the user to interact, like through a form submission, then UI:N. But if the user has to click a link, then UI:R. The description says \"users can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI\". So maybe the attacker is a user who is already authenticated and can inject the code. So the user interaction is not required for the attacker to inject the code. But the user interaction metric refers to the victim's interaction. So if the attacker injects the code into the UI, and then the victim's browser executes it when they visit the page, then the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI:R. So I think UI:R is correct here.\n\nSo the vector would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but let me check the PR again. If the attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, then PR:L. If the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, then PR:N. The description says \"users can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI\". So the attacker is a user who is already authenticated. Therefore, the attacker needs to have user privileges, so PR:L. So that's correct.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 1.8999999999999995, "success": true}

This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject an SQL statement to obtain, update and delete all information in the database. This vulnerability was found in each of the following parameters according to the vulnerability identifier ‘User’ and “email” parameters of the ‘updatePassword’ endpoint.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a SQL injection vulnerability in TCMAN's GIM v11. The goal is to determine the base metrics and calculate the base score. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The metrics are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the 'updatePassword' endpoint, which is accessed via parameters like 'User' and 'email'. Since the attacker doesn't need authentication, and the endpoint is likely accessible over the network (assuming it's a web service), the attack vector would be Network (N). Because the attacker can exploit this remotely without needing to be physically present or have local access.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). SQL injection typically requires the attacker to craft specific input, which might be considered low complexity. However, sometimes if there are multiple steps or checks, it could be high. But in this case, the description says the attacker can inject an SQL statement directly through parameters. That seems straightforward, so AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any authentication. The vulnerability is unauthenticated, so PR is N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is None (N) because the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing user interaction. The SQL injection can be done automatically by the attacker.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability affects the same security scope. The attacker can't elevate privileges or access other scopes. The database is part of the same system, so the scope doesn't change.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is High (H) because the attacker can obtain all information in the database. The vulnerability allows reading data, which is a high impact on confidentiality.\n\nIntegrity (I) is High (H) because the attacker can update and delete data. That's a significant impact on the integrity of the system.\n\nAvailability (A) is High (H) as well. If the attacker can delete data or cause the database to crash, that would impact availability. However, the description mentions the attacker can delete all information, which would definitely affect availability.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. \n\nWait, but I should double-check each metric. For example, is the attack vector really Network? If the endpoint is a web service, then yes, it's network-based. If it's a local application, maybe Local, but the description mentions parameters in an endpoint, which implies a web service. So AV:N is correct. \n\nAttack Complexity: Low because the attacker can inject SQL without needing to bypass any complex checks. \n\nPR:N because no authentication is required. \n\nUI:N because no user interaction is needed. \n\nScope: Unchanged because the attack doesn't allow moving to a different scope. \n\nC, I, A all high because the attacker can read, modify, and delete data, which are high impacts. \n\nYes, that seems right. The base score would be calculated based on these metrics. The final vector string is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\n**Metric Justifications:**\n- **AV:N** (Network): The vulnerability exists in a web endpoint, allowing remote exploitation without physical access.  \n- **AC:L** (Low): The attack requires minimal effort to inject SQL via parameters, with no complex steps needed.  \n- **PR:N** (None): The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability.  \n- **UI:N** (None): No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.  \n- **S:U** (Unchanged): The attack does not elevate privileges or access a different scope.  \n- **C:H** (High): The attacker can extract all database information, compromising confidentiality.  \n- **I:H** (High): The attacker can modify or delete data, severely impacting integrity.  \n- **A:H** (High): The attacker could delete data or cause denial-of-service, impacting availability.", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

In versions up to and including 2.5.9, SQL injection occurs because the $origContent parameter in admin/article_save.php is not strictly filtered. Since admin/article_save.php can be accessed by ordinary registered users, this will cause SQL injection to occur when the registered site is enabled, resulting in the injection of the admin account and password, which is then exploited by the backend remote code execution. As of time of publication, it is unknown whether a fix exists.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring problem. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in Emlog versions up to 2.5.9 where the $origContent parameter in admin/article_save.php isn't properly filtered, leading to SQL injection. The key points here are that the SQL injection can be exploited by registered users, which allows them to inject admin credentials and then get remote code execution.\n\nSo, the first step is to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in admin/article_save.php, which is accessible by registered users. Since the attack requires the attacker to be a registered user, that's a local attack. Wait, but the user is already registered, so maybe it's considered local? Or is it network? Hmm. Wait, the attack vector here is that the attacker needs to be a registered user, which implies they have some level of access. But the SQL injection is in a file that's part of the admin section. So, if the attacker is a registered user, they can access that file. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the system. But wait, the description says \"can be accessed by ordinary registered users\", so the attack vector is Local because the attacker has to be logged in as a user. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The SQL injection is due to not filtering the parameter. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any additional steps beyond exploiting the input. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be a registered user, which implies they have some level of access. But the vulnerability allows them to inject admin credentials, which might require them to have some privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. Since the attacker is already a registered user, they might have low privileges. But the vulnerability allows them to escalate to admin, which is a higher privilege. However, the PR metric refers to the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability, not the resulting privilege escalation. So if the attacker is already a registered user, they might have low privileges. But the description says that the attack is possible when the registered site is enabled. So maybe the PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to be a registered user, which is a low privilege level. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already a registered user, then they have some privileges. But the question is whether the exploit requires any privileges. Since the attacker is already logged in, maybe PR is Low (L). Alternatively, if the attacker needs to have some privileges to access the admin page, then PR is Low. So I think PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says that the SQL injection occurs when the registered site is enabled. The user interaction is not mentioned as required. The attack can be done without user interaction, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability by submitting malicious input. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope refers to whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges. Since the vulnerability allows the attacker to inject admin credentials and then exploit remote code execution, which is a different privilege level. So the scope is Changed (C) because the attack can lead to a different privilege level.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The SQL injection allows the attacker to inject admin credentials, which might allow them to access sensitive data. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can access the admin's data.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject admin credentials, which might allow them to modify data. But the description mentions remote code execution, which would affect integrity. So integrity is High (H) because the attacker can modify data or execute code.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability leads to remote code execution, which could potentially cause denial of service. So availability is High (H) because the attacker can disrupt the service.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: Low (L)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Changed (C)\nC: High (H)\nI: High (H)\nA: High (H)\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H. Wait, but I need to check if the scope is changed. The scope is changed because the attack allows the attacker to gain higher privileges (admin access). So S is C. \n\nBut wait, the original question says that the attack allows the attacker to inject admin account and password, which is then exploited by the backend remote code execution. So the scope is changed because the attacker can escalate privileges. Therefore, S is Changed (C). \n\nSo the final vector is as above. Let me double-check each metric again.\n\nAttack Vector: Local (L) because the attacker needs to be a registered user, which is local access.\n\nAttack Complexity: Low (L) because the attack is straightforward.\n\nPrivileges Required: Low (L) because the attacker is already a registered user, which is a low privilege level.\n\nUser Interaction: None (N) because the attack can be done without user interaction.\n\nScope: Changed (C) because the attack allows privilege escalation.\n\nConfidentiality: High (H) because the attacker can access admin credentials.\n\nIntegrity: High (H) because the attacker can modify data via SQL injection and execute code.\n\nAvailability: High (H) because remote code execution can lead to denial of service.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a WordPress plugin vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via SVG file uploads. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have Author-level access, they can't just attack over the network. They have to be on the same site, so AV should be Local (L). Wait, but the description says \"authenticated attackers with Author-level access\". So the attack vector is local because the attacker needs to be logged in. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The attacker doesn't need to do anything complex; they just upload an SVG file. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to be authenticated with Author-level access. That's a low privilege level, right? Because Author is a role in WordPress, but not admin. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says the script executes when a user accesses the SVG file. So the user has to open the SVG, which implies some interaction. But the question is whether UI is required. If the attacker uploads the SVG and the user then accesses it, that's user interaction. But maybe the user doesn't need to do anything else. Wait, the attack is that the attacker injects the script, and when the user accesses the SVG, it executes. So the user has to access the file, which is part of the attack. So UI is Required (R)? Or is it None? Hmm. Wait, the CVSS UI metric is whether user interaction is required for the attack to succeed. If the user has to click on the SVG file, then UI is Required. But if the script is executed automatically when the SVG is loaded, maybe UI is None. But the description says \"whenever a user accesses the SVG file\". So the user has to access it, which is part of the attack. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but maybe the user doesn't need to interact beyond accessing the file. So maybe UI is None? I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. The UI metric is whether the attack requires user interaction. If the user has to click on a link or something, then it's R. If the attack is automatic, like when the user loads the page, then it's N. In this case, the attacker uploads the SVG, and when the user accesses the SVG, the script runs. So the user has to access the SVG, which is part of the attack. But does that count as user interaction? Or is it considered that the user is just accessing the file, which is part of normal usage. Maybe UI is None (N) because the user doesn't need to take any action beyond accessing the file. Wait, but the attack is that the user is accessing the SVG, which is the trigger. So maybe UI is Required (R) because the user has to access the file. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The CVSS UI metric is whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any user action, then UI is N. If the user has to do something, like click a link, then UI is R. In this case, the user has to access the SVG file, which is part of the normal usage. So maybe UI is N. But the attacker has to have the user access the SVG. So the user interaction is required for the attack to work. Therefore, UI is Required (R). Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me check some examples. For example, if a vulnerability allows an attacker to inject a script that runs when the user visits a page, then UI is N because the user is just visiting the page. But if the user has to click on a link that the attacker has placed, then UI is R. In this case, the user is accessing the SVG file, which is part of the normal process. So maybe UI is N. But the attacker has to have the user access the SVG. So the user interaction is required. Wait, the user is the one accessing the SVG, so the attack requires the user to access it. Therefore, UI is Required (R). I think I'll go with UI: Required (R).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts, which affects confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The scope is whether the attack affects a different component. Since the attack is on the same component (the same application), the scope is Unchanged (U). So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The attacker can inject scripts, which can steal data. So confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can modify data, but the description says they inject scripts, which might not directly modify data but can alter the content. Wait, the description says \"inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.\" So the attacker can inject scripts, which could modify the page's content or execute code. So integrity is High (H) because the attacker can alter the data or functionality.\n\nAvailability (A). The attack could lead to denial of service if the script causes the server to crash, but the description doesn't mention that. So availability is None (N) unless there's a possibility. But the description doesn't specify, so A is N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) - attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the site.\nAC: Low (L) - no complex steps needed.\nPR: Low (L) - requires authenticated user with Author-level access.\nUI: Required (R) - user has to access the SVG file.\nS: Unchanged (U) - same component.\nC: High (H) - data can be stolen.\nI: High (H) - scripts can alter content.\nA: None (N) - no mention of availability impact.\n\nWait, but maybe the UI is None. Let me recheck. If the user is just accessing the SVG, which is part of the normal process, then maybe UI is None. For example, if the user is just viewing the page, and the script is executed automatically. In that case, UI is N. But the attacker has to have the user access the SVG. So the user interaction is required. Hmm. Maybe the answer is UI: Required (R). But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The CVSS UI metric is whether the attack requires user interaction. If the user has to take some action, like clicking a link, then it's R. If the attack is automatic, like when the user loads the page, then it's N. In this case, the user is accessing the SVG file, which is part of the normal process. So the user doesn't need to take any action beyond accessing the file. Therefore, UI is None (N). Wait, but the attacker has to have the user access the SVG. So the user is the one who is accessing it. So the attack requires the user to access the file. But the user is not taking any action beyond that. So maybe UI is N. I think I need to go with UI: None (N) because the user is just accessing the file, which is part of normal usage. So the attack doesn't require any additional user interaction beyond that. Therefore, UI is N.\n\nSo revising the UI to N. Then the vector would be:\n\nAV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nNow, let's check the final vector. The answer would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nBut wait, the original description says \"authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.\" So the user is the one accessing the SVG, which is part of the attack. So the user interaction is required. Wait, but the user is the one who is accessing the SVG. So the attack requires the user to access the SVG. But the user is not taking any action beyond that. So maybe UI is N. I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the CVSS UI definition. According to CVSS, UI is \"whether the attack requires user interaction to be successful.\" If the user has to click on a link or perform an action, then it's R. If the attack is automatic, like when the user loads a page, then it's N. In this case, the user is accessing the SVG file, which is part of the normal process. So the attack is automatic once the SVG is uploaded. Therefore, UI is N.

The user provided a CVE description about a WordPress plugin vulnerability. The main issues are missing CSRF checks and sanitization/escaping, leading to Stored XSS via CSRF.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is exploited via a CSRF attack. CSRF typically requires the victim to be authenticated and the attacker to trick them into performing an action. Since the attack is done over the network (like a malicious link), AV should be Network (N). But wait, CSRF is usually considered a network attack because it's done remotely without direct access. So AV:N makes sense.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions that the plugin lacks CSRF checks and sanitization. The attacker doesn't need to have any special skills beyond tricking the user. So the complexity is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to perform any additional steps beyond the CSRF attack.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior privileges. The user just needs to be logged in, which is part of the attack vector. The attacker doesn't have to escalate privileges here.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is Required (R) because the victim has to click on a malicious link. However, some might argue that CSRF doesn't require user interaction, but in the context of CVSS, if the attack requires the user to take an action (like clicking a link), then UI:R. Wait, but the CVE says the attacker can make the admin add payloads via CSRF. So the user interaction is required for the attack to work. So UI:R.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't change the scope. The attack affects the same component (the admin's ability to add XSS payloads), so the scope isn't changed. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is None (N) because the vulnerability is about XSS, which is more about integrity and availability. Wait, Stored XSS can lead to confidentiality if the attacker can read data, but the description doesn't mention that. So C:N.\n\nIntegrity (I) is High (H) because the attacker can inject malicious scripts, which can alter the content or data on the site. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A) is None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't directly impact availability. The main issue is XSS, which is more about integrity. So A:N.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check again. The description says \"Stored XSS payloads via a CSRF attack.\" Stored XSS can lead to data theft (confidentiality) if the attacker can steal cookies or other data, but the description doesn't specify that. So maybe C:N, I:H, A:N. But sometimes, XSS can be considered as affecting confidentiality if the attacker can read data. However, the CVSS metrics are based on the description. Since the description doesn't mention confidentiality loss, I think C:N is correct.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:N, I:H, A:N. Then the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. Wait, but some sources might say that UI is None (N) for CSRF. Let me double-check. The CVSS UI metric is \"User Interaction\" required. For CSRF, the user must interact (click a link), so UI:R. But some might argue that the attack doesn't require user interaction beyond the initial login. However, according to CVSS guidelines, if the attack requires the user to take an action (like clicking a link), then UI:R. So I think UI:R is correct here.\n\nSo the final vector is as above. Let me confirm each metric again:\n\nAV:N (CSRF is network-based), AC:L (no additional complexity), PR:N (no prior auth), UI:R (user must click), S:U (same scope), C:N, I:H, A:N. Yes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 0.40000000000000036, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a WordPress plugin vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the'space' shortcode, which is part of the plugin. The description says authenticated attackers with contributor-level access can exploit it. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the site, this is likely a Local (L) attack vector. Because the attacker has to be logged in and have access to the site's backend, it's not network-based. So AV:L.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires the attacker to have contributor-level access, but the description mentions that the issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. If the attacker can exploit this without needing additional steps, maybe the complexity is Low. But I need to check if there's any additional steps required. Since the attacker just needs to input malicious code through the shortcode, maybe it's Low. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low privilege level. So PR:L. Wait, but the question says PR options are None, Low, High. Contributor-level access is considered a low privilege requirement because it's not admin. So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says the script executes when a user accesses the injected page. So the attacker injects the script, and then the user has to visit the page. That implies that user interaction is required. So UI:R. Wait, but sometimes if the attacker can inject the script and it's executed automatically, maybe UI is None. But the description says \"injected page\" which the user has to access. So the user has to click on the link or visit the page. Therefore, UI:R.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the plugin, and the attack is on the same component (the plugin's functionality), the scope is Unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows injecting arbitrary scripts, which can steal data. So confidentiality is High. C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can inject scripts, which could modify content. So integrity is High. I:H.\n\nAvailability (A). The attack could lead to denial of service if the script causes issues, but the description doesn't mention that. So maybe A:N. Wait, but the description says \"execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" If the script is malicious, it could potentially cause the site to crash or be taken over, but the description doesn't specify availability impact. So maybe A:N. But sometimes, if the script can cause the site to be taken over, that could affect availability. However, the description doesn't mention that. So I'll go with A:N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the user interaction is required. Let me check again. The attacker injects the script, and then the user has to access the page. So the user interaction is required. So UI:R. But some might argue that the user interaction is not required because the attacker can inject the script, and the user just needs to visit the page. But in terms of CVSS, if the attack requires the user to take some action (like clicking a link), then UI:R. So that's correct.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but the example given in the problem has UI:N. Let me check the example again. The example was Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. So in the example, UI:N. But in our case, the user has to access the page, so UI:R. But maybe the user interaction is not required because the attacker can inject the script, and the user just needs to view the page. Wait, the description says \"injected page\" which the user accesses. So the user has to access the page, which is part of the attack. So UI:R. But maybe the user interaction is not required because the attacker can inject the script, and the user's action is just visiting the page. But in CVSS, UI:R means that the user interaction is required. So if the attacker needs the user to click a link or visit a page, then UI:R. So I think UI:R is correct here.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Let me check the CVSS definitions. User Interaction (UI) is required if the attack requires the user to take some action, like clicking a link. If the attacker can inject the script and the user just needs to view the page, then the user interaction is required. So UI:R. Therefore, the vector would have UI:R. But maybe the user interaction is not required because the attacker can inject the script, and the user's action is just visiting the page. Wait, the user is the one who accesses the page, so the user is interacting with the page. So the attack requires the user to access the page, which is part of the attack. Therefore, UI:R.\n\nSo the final vector is AV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. But I need to make sure all the metrics are correct. Let me check each again.\n\nAttack Vector: Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the site. Attack Complexity: Low (L) because the attacker can exploit it with minimal steps. Privileges Required: Low (L) because contributor access is required. User Interaction: Required (R) because the user has to access the injected page. Scope: Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't affect other components. Confidentiality: High (H) because scripts can steal data. Integrity: High (H) because scripts can modify content.

In versions 0.6.8 and prior, a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY AI where normal users are improperly granted permissions to export APP DSL. The feature in '/export' should only allow administrator users to export DSL. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can export the APP DSL. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.13.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in Dify's export feature, where normal users can export APP DSL, which should only be allowed for admins. The fix involves updating access controls and implementing RBAC.\n\nStarting with the base metrics. Let's go step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is related to access control. The issue is that normal users can access a feature they shouldn't. Since the problem is about user permissions, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated as a user. But wait, could it be Network (N)? If the export feature is accessible via an API, maybe an attacker could exploit it remotely. But the description says \"normal users are improperly granted permissions,\" implying that the attacker is already authenticated. So AV is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be a user with access to the system. But I need to check if the attack is through network. If the export is done via an API endpoint, maybe it's network. Hmm. The description doesn't specify if it's local or remote. But since it's about user permissions, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker has to be a user with access. So AV: L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability requires the attacker to have the correct user role. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any additional steps beyond being a normal user. The access control is not properly enforced, so the complexity is Low (L). So AC: L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be a normal user, which is a low privilege level. But the vulnerability allows them to do something they shouldn't. However, the PR metric refers to the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since the attacker is already a normal user, they don't need to escalate privileges. So PR: N (None) because the attacker doesn't need any additional privileges beyond their existing user role. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is a normal user, they already have the privileges to access the feature, but the vulnerability allows them to do something they shouldn't. So the PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to gain any additional privileges. So PR: N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The attacker can exploit this without needing user interaction. So UI: N (None).\n\nScope (S): The scope refers to whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the vulnerability is about user permissions within the same component (the export feature), the scope is Unchanged (U). So S: U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows normal users to export APP DSL, which is data. So confidentiality is compromised. The impact is High (H) because the data being exported could be sensitive. So C: H.\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability doesn't directly affect the integrity of the system. The issue is about unauthorized access to data, not modifying data. So I: N.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't impact availability. The problem is about access control, not causing denial of service. So A: N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Then the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Wait, but the example given in the problem has C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I made a mistake with Integrity and Availability. Let me check again.\n\nThe vulnerability allows normal users to export DSL, which is data. So confidentiality is high (C:H). Integrity (I) refers to the ability to modify data. Since the vulnerability doesn't allow modification, I is N. Availability (A) is about denial of service, which isn't mentioned. So A:N. So the vector is correct as above. But maybe I should check if the vulnerability could affect availability. For example, if the export feature is a resource that could be abused to cause a DoS. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think the initial assessment is correct. So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "score": 1.9000000000000004, "success": true}

It was found from vmcore that perf had registered two ops with the same content successively, both dynamic. After unregistering the second ops, a use-after-free occurred. In ftrace_shutdown(), when the second ops is unregistered, the FTRACE_UPDATE_CALLS command is not set because there is another enabled ops with the same content. Also, both ops are dynamic and the ftrace callback function is ftrace_ops_list_func, so the FTRACE_UPDATE_TRACE_FUNC command will not be set. Eventually the value of 'command' will be 0 and ftrace_shutdown() will skip the rcu synchronization. However, ftrace may be activated. When the ops is released, another CPU may be accessing the ops. Add the missing synchronization to fix this problem.

The user provided a CVE description about a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's ftrace module. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, I'll recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The base score is determined by AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is a system-level component. The use-after-free occurs when the kernel is being accessed, so the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to have local access to the system. But wait, the description mentions that the issue could be triggered by a remote attacker? Wait, no. The problem is with ftrace, which is part of the kernel's tracing mechanism. The vulnerability is triggered when perf registers ops, and the issue is with the synchronization. Since the attacker would need to have local access to the system to exploit this, AV is Local (L). But wait, sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger them via network. However, the description doesn't mention any network-based exploitation. The KASAN report shows it's a use-after-free in the kernel code, which is typically a local issue. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity here is whether the attacker needs to perform multiple steps. The vulnerability requires the attacker to register two ops with the same content, then unregister the second one. This seems like a low complexity because the attacker can do this with existing permissions. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have some privileges to register ops with ftrace. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attacker would need to have local access, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already in the system, they might have the necessary privileges. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be a privileged user (like root), then PR is High (H). But in this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have local access, which implies they already have some privileges. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without needing elevated privileges, then PR is Low (L). Wait, the description says that the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have local access, which is typically considered as having some privileges. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already in the system, they might have the necessary privileges. However, the PR metric is categorized as None (N), Low (L), or High (H). For example, if the attacker needs to be a user with certain privileges (like root), then PR is High. But if the attacker can exploit it without needing any specific privileges beyond being logged in, then it's Low. Since this is a kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need to have local access, which is considered as having some privileges. However, the PR metric for kernel vulnerabilities is often considered as Low (L) because the attacker is already in the system. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be a privileged user (like root) to exploit it, then PR is High. But if the attacker can exploit it with normal user privileges, then it's Low. The description doesn't specify, but since it's a kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need to have local access, which is typically considered as having some privileges. However, the PR metric for kernel vulnerabilities is often considered as Low (L) because the attacker is already in the system. Wait, maybe I should check the CVSS guidelines. According to CVSS v3.1, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated (like a local user), then PR is Low (L). If the attacker needs to be a privileged user (like root), then it's High (H). Since this is a kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need to have local access, which is considered as having some privileges. But the PR metric for kernel vulnerabilities is often considered as Low (L) because the attacker is already in the system. So I think PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a use-after-free that occurs during the shutdown process. The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The attacker can trigger the vulnerability without needing user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on the system's integrity and availability. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on the system's components, the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, the scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new vulnerability in a different component. In this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on the kernel's functionality. So the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but the use-after-free could lead to arbitrary code execution, which would be a different component. However, the scope is determined by whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. If the vulnerability can be exploited to gain higher privileges or affect other components, then the scope is Changed (C). But in this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on the kernel's own components. So the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but the use-after-free could lead to arbitrary code execution, which would be a different component. However, the scope is about whether the impact is on a different component. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component (like gaining root access), then the scope is Changed (C). But the description doesn't mention that. The vulnerability is a use-after-free, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, but the scope is determined by whether the impact is on a different component. Since the kernel is the component, and the vulnerability is within the kernel, the scope is Unchanged (U). So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability is a use-after-free, which could allow the attacker to read memory that shouldn't be accessible. So the confidentiality impact is High (H). Because the attacker could access sensitive data.\n\nIntegrity (I): The use-after-free could allow the attacker to modify data structures, leading to arbitrary code execution or other integrity issues. So the integrity impact is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability could lead to denial of service, as the use-after-free could cause the system to crash or become unstable. So the availability impact is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: Low (L)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: High (H)\nI: High (H)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\nWait, but I need to check if the scope is Changed (C). Let me think again. The scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain root privileges, then the scope is Changed. But in this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on the kernel's own components. However, the use-after-free could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code, which would be a different component (like the kernel's code). Wait, the scope is about whether the impact is on a different component. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component (like the kernel's code), then the scope is Changed. But the kernel is the component itself. So the scope is Unchanged (U). Therefore, S is U.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

This issue is fixed in macOS Sequoia 15.3, Safari 18.3, iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3, visionOS 2.3. A maliciously crafted webpage may be able to fingerprint the user.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description, and I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let me start by understanding the description.\n\nThe issue is about improved access restrictions to the file system, fixed in several versions. The problem is that a malicious webpage could fingerprint the user. So, the vulnerability is related to user fingerprinting, which is a privacy concern. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out each metric. Let's go step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The description mentions a malicious webpage. Webpages are accessed over the network, so the attack vector is Network (N). But wait, sometimes if it's a local exploit, it's Local. But here, the attack is via a webpage, which is remote. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says \"may be able to fingerprint the user.\" The fix was improved access restrictions. If the attack requires some complexity, like specific conditions, but the description doesn't mention any. Since it's a webpage, maybe the complexity is low. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user doesn't mention needing any specific privileges. The attack is possible without needing to be authenticated, so PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack is via a webpage. Does it require user interaction? The description says \"may be able to fingerprint the user.\" Fingerprinting could be done without user interaction, like through browser features. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability affects a different component. The issue is about file system access restrictions, but the attack is about fingerprinting. If the attack affects a different component (like user privacy vs. file system), then scope is Changed (C). But if it's the same component, then Unchanged (U). Hmm. The original issue was about file system access, but the attack is about fingerprinting. Maybe the scope is Changed because the attack affects a different aspect (privacy vs. file system access). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the attack is within the same component (like the browser's ability to fingerprint), then scope is Unchanged. Need to think. The fix was for file system access, but the attack is about fingerprinting. Maybe the scope is Changed because the attack is a different aspect. So S:C.\n\nConfidentiality (C): Fingerprinting could involve collecting user data, which is a confidentiality issue. If the user's data is exposed, then C is High (H). But if it's just identifying the user, maybe it's Low. However, in CVSS, confidentiality is about unauthorized disclosure of information. Fingerprinting could be considered as leaking information, so C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attack doesn't modify data, so I:N.\n\nAvailability (A): The attack doesn't affect availability, so A:N.\n\nWait, but the original issue was about file system access. The attack is via a webpage, which could be a different component. So maybe the scope is Changed. Let me check again. The original problem was about file system access, but the attack is about fingerprinting. If the attack is a different component, then scope is Changed. But if the attack is within the same component (like the browser's ability to fingerprint), then scope is Unchanged. The description says the issue was addressed with improved access restrictions to the file system. So the original problem was about file system access, but the attack is about fingerprinting. So maybe the scope is Changed because the attack is a different component. Therefore, S:C.\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact a different component. If the attack is on the same component (like the browser's ability to fingerprint, which is part of the same component as the file system access), then scope is Unchanged. But if the attack is on a different component (like the user's privacy, which is a different aspect), then scope is Changed. This is a bit ambiguous. However, in the context of the CVE, the fix was for file system access, but the attack is about fingerprinting. So maybe the scope is Changed. But I'm not certain. Let me check some examples. For example, if a vulnerability allows an attacker to read files (confidentiality) and then another vulnerability allows them to modify files (integrity), the scope would be Changed. But in this case, the attack is about fingerprinting, which is a different aspect. So I think S:C.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAV:N (network), AC:L (low complexity), PR:N (no privileges), UI:N (no user interaction), S:C (scope changed), C:H (confidentiality high), I:N (integrity none), A:N (availability none).\n\nThen the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\nWait, but the user's example had S:U. Let me check again. If the scope is unchanged, then S:U. But if the attack is a different component, then S:C. The original issue was about file system access, but the attack is about fingerprinting. So the scope is Changed. Therefore, S:C.\n\nBut maybe the attack is within the same component. For example, if the file system access is part of the same component as the browser's fingerprinting. So maybe the scope is Unchanged. This is tricky. Let me think again. The original problem was about file system access, but the attack is about fingerprinting. If the attack is a different component, then scope is Changed. But if the attack is a different aspect of the same component, then scope is Unchanged. For example, if the component is the browser, then both file system access and fingerprinting are part of the same component. Therefore, the scope is Unchanged. So S:U.\n\nHmm, this is a critical point. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to access the file system (which is a different component than the browser's fingerprinting), then the scope is Changed. But if the file system access is part of the same component (like the browser's access to the file system), then the scope is Unchanged. The description says the issue was addressed with improved access restrictions to the file system. So the original problem was about file system access, but the attack is about fingerprinting. So the attack is a different component. Therefore, the scope is Changed. So S:C.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the scope is Unchanged because the attack is within the same component. For example, the browser's ability to fingerprint is part of the same component as the file system access. Therefore, the scope is Unchanged. So S:U.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the CVSS scope definition. Scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact a different component. If the attack is on the same component, then scope is Unchanged. If it's a different component, then Changed. So if the original issue was about file system access (component A), and the attack is about fingerprinting (component B), then scope is Changed. But if both are part of the same component (like the browser's component), then scope is Unchanged. \n\nThe CVE description says the issue was addressed with improved access restrictions to the file system. The attack is via a webpage, which is part of the browser. So the attack is on the same component (the browser's component), but the original issue was about file system access. However, the attack is about fingerprinting, which is a different aspect. But if the browser is the component, then both are part of the same component. Therefore, the scope is Unchanged. So S:U.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct scope is Unchanged (S:U). \n\nSo revising the metrics:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nThen the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\nBut wait, the user's example had S:U. Let me check again. The original issue was about file system access, but the attack is about fingerprinting. If the attack is a different component, then S:C. But if the attack is within the same component (browser), then S:U. \n\nIn this case, the attack is via a webpage, which is part of the browser. The original issue was about file system access, which is part of the same component (the browser's access to the file system). Therefore, the scope is Unchanged. So S:U.\n\nTherefore, the final vector is as above. \n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me think of another example. Suppose a vulnerability allows an attacker to read files (confidentiality), and another allows them to modify files (integrity). The scope would be Changed because they affect different aspects. But in this case, the attack is about fingerprinting, which is a different aspect of the same component. So the scope is Unchanged. \n\nTherefore, the correct scope is S:U. \n\nSo the final metrics are:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nThus, the vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 1.0, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in the Bandsintown Events plugin for WordPress. The issue is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The attacker needs contributor-level access and can inject scripts that execute when a user visits an injected page.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is via the shortcode, which is part of the plugin. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated (contributor-level access), the attack vector is Local (L). Wait, but the user is accessing the page, so maybe it's Network? Wait, no. The attacker has to be authenticated and have contributor access. So the attack vector is Local because the attacker needs to be logged in and have access to the site. But wait, the description says \"authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above\" can inject scripts. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker has to be on the same network or have local access? Wait, no. In CVSS, Attack Vector is about how the attack is delivered. For XSS, if it's stored, the attack vector is usually Local (L) because the attacker has to be authenticated to post the malicious content. Wait, but sometimes it's considered Network (N) if the attacker can inject via a network request. Hmm. Wait, the description says the attacker can inject scripts into pages that execute when a user accesses them. So the attacker has to be authenticated to inject the script, but the actual execution is when a user visits the page. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the site. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need any special tools or steps beyond being authenticated. The input sanitization is insufficient, so the attack is straightforward. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low privilege level. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is stored XSS, which typically requires no user interaction once the script is injected. The user just needs to visit the page. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to elevate privileges beyond the initial access. The attack affects the same privilege level (contributor) and doesn't change the scope to a different component.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts, which can potentially steal data. So Confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can access sensitive information.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject scripts, which can alter the content or manipulate the page. So Integrity is High (H) because the attacker can modify data.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't directly affect availability. The script execution might cause denial of service, but the description doesn't mention that. So Availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but the example given in the problem has A:H. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The description says \"inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the attacker can execute scripts, which could lead to DoS if the script is malicious. But the problem doesn't mention availability impact. So maybe A is None. But sometimes, XSS can be used to cause denial of service by, for example, crashing the browser. However, the CVSS scoring might not consider that unless explicitly stated. Since the description doesn't mention availability, I think A is None (N).

Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The problem is related to handling packets, which are sent over a network. So the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can exploit this remotely over the network. \n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The flaw is due to an incorrect packet length check.

The user provided a CVE description about a Stored XSS vulnerability in the BuddyBoss Platform plugin and theme. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the 'invitee_name' parameter. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated (Subscriber-level access), the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker has to be logged in. Wait, but the description says \"authenticated attackers\" so that's Local. But wait, sometimes if the attack is via a parameter in a request, maybe it's Network? Hmm. Wait, Stored XSS usually requires the attacker to have some way to inject the script into the site, which is typically done via a local request. But if the parameter is in a form that's submitted via a request, maybe it's Network? Wait, no. Stored XSS is when the attacker injects code into a page that's stored on the server, and then other users access it. So the attack vector would be Local because the attacker has to be authenticated to submit the malicious input. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says the vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps beyond submitting the input. So Attack Complexity is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be authenticated with Subscriber-level access or higher. So PR is Low (L) because it's not requiring admin privileges, just Subscriber. Wait, but the question says \"Privileges Required (PR): None (N), Low (L), High (H)\". So if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's Low (L) because it's not requiring root or admin, just some user account. So PR is L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is Stored XSS, which typically requires the user to click on a malicious link or view a page with the injected script. However, the description says \"authenticated attackers... to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the user interaction is required? Wait, the attacker injects the script, and then when another user accesses the page, the script runs. So the user interaction is not required for the attack to execute once the script is injected. Wait, but the initial injection might require user interaction. Wait, no. The attacker can inject the script via a form submission, which is a local action. So the user interaction here is not required for the attack. Wait, the UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. For Stored XSS, the attacker injects the script, and then the victim has to access the page. So the user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. Wait, but the attacker is the one who injects the script. So the attacker's action is local, and the victim's action is accessing the page. So the UI is Required (R)? Or is it None (N)? Hmm. Let me think. The UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be triggered without any user interaction, then UI is N. But in this case, the attacker injects the script, and then the victim has to access the page. So the user (victim) has to interact with the page. So the UI is Required (R). Wait, but the attacker is the one who injects the script. The user interaction here refers to whether the user (victim) has to take some action. So if the script is stored and then the victim accesses the page, that's user interaction. So UI is Required (R). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. For example, in a Stored XSS, the attacker injects the script, and then the victim has to click on a link or view the page. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI is R. But some sources say that Stored XSS can be considered as requiring user interaction. So I think UI is R here.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts, which can affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The scope is Changed (C) because the attack can affect resources beyond the ones directly impacted. For example, if the attacker can inject scripts that steal cookies (confidentiality), modify data (integrity), or cause denial of service (availability), then the scope is Changed. So S is C.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can steal cookies or other sensitive data, so confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can modify data on the site, so integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The attacker could potentially cause denial of service, but the description doesn't mention that. So availability is None (N) unless there's a way to disrupt the service. But the description doesn't specify that, so A is N.\n\nWait, but the description says \"inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the attacker can execute scripts, which could lead to various impacts. But the CVSS metrics are about the impact. So for C, I, A, the values are based on the potential impact. Since the attacker can inject scripts, which can steal data (C:H), modify data (I:H), and maybe cause DoS (A:L or H). But the description doesn't mention DoS, so A is N. So the final vector would be:\n\nAV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:R, S:C, C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about UI. Let me check again. The user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. Because the attacker injects the script, but the victim has to access the page. So the user interaction is required. So UI is R. But some sources might say that for Stored XSS, the UI is N. Wait, the CVSS v3.1 defines UI as \"whether the attack requires user interaction to be successful.\" For example, if the attack can be triggered without any user interaction, then UI is N. But in Stored XSS, the attacker injects the script, and then the victim has to access the page. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI is R. So that's correct.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:L (Local), AC:L (Low complexity), PR:L (Low privileges), UI:R (User interaction required), S:C (Scope changed), C:H (High confidentiality), I:H (High integrity), A:N (No availability impact).\n\nSo the vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.5, "success": true}

The user provided a CVE description about a denial of service vulnerability in GitLab. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability allows an attacker to spike resource usage, leading to service degradation. Since the attacker can do this remotely without needing to be on the same network, I think AV is Network (N). Wait, but maybe it's adjacent? Wait, the description doesn't mention anything about needing to be on the same network or physical access. It's a remote attack, so AV:N makes sense.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires the attacker to send a specific payload that causes resource spikes. Is that low or high complexity? If the attacker needs to craft a specific payload, that might be high complexity. But sometimes, if it's a simple exploit, it's low. Hmm. The description says \"spike the GitLab instance resource usage\" which might be a straightforward exploit. Maybe AC:L. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. If the attack requires some setup or specific conditions, it's high. If it's a simple exploit, low. Since it's a denial of service, maybe it's low complexity. I'll go with AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker doesn't need any privileges to exploit this. The vulnerability is in the application, so PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description doesn't mention any need for user interaction. The attacker can trigger the DoS remotely without user action. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability. But the scope is whether the attack impacts a different component. Since the DoS affects the service itself, the scope is unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The DoS doesn't directly affect confidentiality. The attacker isn't leaking data, just causing resource usage. So C:N.\n\nIntegrity (I). Similarly, the attacker isn't modifying data, just causing the service to be unavailable. So I:N.\n\nAvailability (A). The DoS directly affects availability by causing service degradation. So A:H.\n\nWait, but the user might have different interpretations. Let me check again. The CVSS metrics for DoS usually have A:H. So the final vector would be AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. But wait, the user's example had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the CVE description. The vulnerability allows an attacker to spike resource usage, leading to service degradation. So the availability is affected. But confidentiality and integrity? If the attacker can cause the service to be unavailable, that's availability. But does it affect confidentiality or integrity? If the attacker can't access data or modify it, then C and I are N. So the answer would be A:H, others as above. But maybe the user thinks that the attack could lead to data loss or corruption? The description doesn't mention that. So I think C:N, I:N, A:H. \n\nWait, but sometimes DoS can be considered as affecting availability. So the final vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But the example given in the problem had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the original CVE again. The description says \"spike the GitLab instance resource usage resulting in service degradation.\" So the main impact is on availability. So A:H. But maybe the attacker could also cause data loss? The description doesn't mention that. So C and I are N. \n\nSo the final vector would be AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. But I need to make sure each metric is correct. Let me go through each again.\n\nAttack Vector: Network (N) because the attacker can exploit it remotely. Attack Complexity: Low (L) because the exploit is straightforward. Privileges Required: None (N). User Interaction: None (N). Scope: Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't affect a different component. Confidentiality: None (N), Integrity: None (N), Availability: High (H). \n\nYes, that seems right. So the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the example in the problem had C:H, I:H, A:H. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. For DoS, the impact is usually on availability. So A:H. But sometimes, if the DoS can lead to data loss, then C or I could be affected. But the description here doesn't mention that.

This enables the attacker to run commands as if they are a legitimate authenticated user. However, to exploit this vulnerability, the authenticated user must navigate to a malicious page during the GlobalProtect SAML login process on a Windows device. This issue does not apply to the GlobalProtect app on other (non-Windows) platforms.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows. The goal is to determine the base metrics and calculate the base score.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The metrics are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attacker can exploit this remotely. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to run ActiveX controls. Since the attack is via the network (since it's remote), AV should be Network (N). But wait, the user has to navigate to a malicious page during the SAML login process. Is that considered network or adjacent? Hmm. The SAML login process is part of the app's functionality. But the attacker is exploiting a vulnerability in the app that's accessible via the network. Since the attack is remote, AV is Network (N). So AV:N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions that the authenticated user must navigate to a malicious page. Does this require any specific steps that increase complexity? The attacker needs to get the user to visit a malicious page, which might be considered low complexity because it's not requiring special tools or steps beyond the user's action. But wait, the user has to be authenticated. So maybe the attack complexity is high because the attacker needs to have the user already authenticated. Wait, the PR (Privileges Required) is about the privileges needed to exploit. Let me check that later. For AC, the complexity is about how hard it is for the attacker to exploit. If the user has to navigate to a malicious page, that's part of the attack vector. But the complexity here might be low because the attacker doesn't need to do much beyond the user's action. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs the user to be authenticated. The vulnerability allows running commands as the authenticated user. So the attacker doesn't need to have any privileges beyond the user's existing authentication. So PR:N. Because the attacker doesn't need to have any privileges; they just need the user to be authenticated. Wait, but the user is already authenticated. So the attacker doesn't need to elevate privileges. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The user must navigate to a malicious page. That's a requirement for the attack. So UI:R. Because the user interaction is required. But wait, the user is already authenticated. The attacker has to get the user to visit the malicious page. So the user interaction is required. So UI:R.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The description says the attacker can run commands as the authenticated user. Since the attack is within the same component (the app on the same system), the scope is Unchanged (U). So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can run commands as the user, which could lead to accessing sensitive data. So C:H. Because the attacker can read the user's data.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can run commands, which could modify data. So I:H. Because the attacker can alter the system's data.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability allows running commands, but the description doesn't mention any denial of service. So A:N. Unless the commands could lead to resource exhaustion, but the description doesn't specify that. So A:N.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but let me double-check each metric again.\n\nWait, for UI:R, the user interaction is required. The attacker needs the user to navigate to the malicious page. So that's correct. So UI:R. \n\nBut some might argue that the user interaction is required, but the attacker can't exploit without the user's action. So UI:R is correct.\n\nFor Scope, since the attack is within the same component (the app on the same system), the scope is unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality and Integrity are both High because the attacker can access and modify data. Availability is not affected, so A:N.\n\nSo the final vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. \n\nNow, calculating the base score. Let me check the CVSS calculator. The base score is calculated based on the metrics. Let me see:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:N (None), UI:R (Required), S:U (Unchanged), C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nThe base score formula for v3.1 is a bit complex, but since the user only asked for the vector string, maybe I don't need to calculate the score.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into an already existing query to store cross-site scripting in store reviews.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a SQL Injection vulnerability in the Super Store Finder plugin for WordPress. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, let me recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The base metrics are Attack Vector (AV), Attack Complexity (AC), Privileges Required (PR), User Interaction (UI), Scope (S), Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). Each has specific options.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the'ssf_wp_user_name' parameter. Since the plugin is for WordPress, which is a web application, the attack vector would be Network (N) because the attacker can exploit this remotely over the network. But wait, the description says \"unauthenticated attackers\" can exploit it. So they don't need to be authenticated, but the attack is via a parameter in a request, which is typically network-based. So AV:N makes sense here.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping and lack of preparation on the SQL query. The attacker can append additional SQL queries. This seems like a low complexity because the attacker doesn't need to perform any special steps beyond providing the malicious input. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior access or authentication. The description says \"unauthenticated attackers\" can exploit it, so PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is None (N) because the attack can be done without any user interaction. The attacker just sends the malicious input, and the system processes it, leading to the vulnerability. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't change the scope. The attack affects the same component (the plugin) and doesn't allow the attacker to gain privileges beyond what's already possible. Wait, but the description mentions cross-site scripting in store reviews. If the attacker can inject XSS, that might be a different scope. Wait, but the original vulnerability is SQL Injection. The SQL Injection allows the attacker to modify the database, which could lead to XSS if the data is stored in reviews. However, the scope in CVSS refers to whether the attack can affect resources beyond those directly impacted. Since the SQL Injection is in the same component (the plugin), the scope is Unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): High (H) because SQL Injection can allow the attacker to read data from the database, which is a confidentiality issue. The attacker can retrieve sensitive information.\n\nIntegrity (I): High (H) because the attacker can modify the database, which could alter data, like store reviews. So integrity is compromised.\n\nAvailability (A): High (H) because SQL Injection could lead to denial of service if the attacker can delete or corrupt data, but the description doesn't mention that. Wait, the description says \"store cross-site scripting in store reviews.\" So maybe the attacker can inject XSS, which is more about integrity (since they can modify the data) and confidentiality (if they can read data). But the original vulnerability is SQL Injection, which typically allows both reading and modifying data. However, the specific impact here is that the attacker can append additional SQL queries to store XSS in reviews. So the attacker can modify the data (integrity) and possibly read data (confidentiality). But the CVSS metrics for C, I, A are based on the impact. Since the vulnerability allows the attacker to inject SQL, which can lead to both confidentiality and integrity issues. However, the question is about the base metrics. The base metrics are about the impact. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data (C:H), modify data (I:H), and possibly cause denial of service (A:H). But the description doesn't mention availability. However, the original SQL Injection could lead to DoS if the attacker can cause the database to crash or something. But the description doesn't specify that. So maybe A is None? Wait, but the problem says \"store cross-site scripting in store reviews.\" So the attacker can inject XSS, which is a client-side issue. But the SQL Injection is the vector. So the primary impact is on the database, which affects confidentiality and integrity. However, the CVSS metrics for C, I, A are based on the impact. So if the attacker can read data (C:H), modify data (I:H), and maybe not affect availability (A:N). But the original description says \"store cross-site scripting in store reviews.\" So the attacker can inject XSS, which is a different vector. But the base metric is about the vulnerability itself. The SQL Injection allows the attacker to inject SQL, which can lead to various impacts. However, the specific impact here is that the attacker can store XSS in reviews. So the attacker can modify the data (integrity) and possibly read data (confidentiality). But the availability is not mentioned. So maybe A:N. Wait, but the original SQL Injection could lead to DoS if the attacker can cause the database to crash. But the description doesn't mention that. So perhaps A:N. However, the problem states that the vulnerability allows the attacker to append additional SQL queries into an existing query. So the attacker can modify the database, which affects integrity. But the attacker can also read data, which affects confidentiality. So C:H and I:H. Availability is not mentioned, so A:N. Wait, but the original question says \"store cross-site scripting in store reviews.\" So the attacker can inject XSS, which is a client-side issue. But the SQL Injection is the vector. So the primary impact is on the database, which affects confidentiality and integrity. So C:H and I:H. Availability is not directly mentioned, so A:N. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. For SQL Injection, the base metrics would typically have C:H (since data can be read), I:H (since data can be modified), and A:N (unless the attack can cause DoS). But the description doesn't mention DoS, so A:N. So the final metrics would be C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the example given in the problem's final line example has A:H. Wait, the example is just an example. Let me think again. The problem says the attacker can append additional SQL queries to store XSS in store reviews. So the attacker can inject SQL to modify the database (integrity) and possibly read data (confidentiality). But the XSS is a separate issue. However, the base metrics are about the vulnerability itself. The SQL Injection is the vulnerability, and the XSS is a consequence. So the base metrics for the SQL Injection would be C:H (confidentiality), I:H (integrity), and A:N (availability). But maybe the XSS is considered as part of the integrity. So the answer would be C:H, I:H, A:N. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the attacker can inject SQL to modify data (I:H) and read data (C:H), and the availability is not affected, then A:N. So the final metrics would be C:H, I:H, A:N. But I need to make sure. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data, that's C:H. If they can modify data, that's I:H. If they can cause denial of service, that's A:H. Since the description doesn't mention DoS, A:N. So the answer would be C:H, I:H, A:N. But the example in the problem's final line has A:H. Wait, the example is just an example. So I need to proceed with the given description. The problem says the attacker can append additional SQL queries to store XSS in store reviews. So the attacker can modify the data (integrity) and possibly read data (confidentiality). So C:H, I:H, A:N. But maybe the attacker can also cause the application to crash, leading to availability. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think A:N. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low complexity), PR:N (None), UI:N (None), S:U (Unchanged), C:H (High confidentiality), I:H (High integrity), A:N (None). \n\nWait, but the example in the problem's final line has A:H. But that's just an example. So I need to stick to the given description. \n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"store cross-site scripting in store reviews.\" So the attacker can inject XSS, which is a client-side issue. But the base metrics are about the vulnerability's impact. The SQL Injection is the vector, and the XSS is a consequence. So the base metrics for the SQL Injection would be C:H (confidentiality), I:H (integrity), and A:N (availability). \n\nTherefore, the final vector is as above. \n\nBut I need to make sure.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a WordPress plugin vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the 'polls_popup' shortcode, which is part of the plugin. The description says authenticated attackers with contributor-level access can exploit it. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the site, this is likely a Local (L) attack vector. Because the attacker has to be logged in and have access to the site's backend, it's not network-based. So AV:L.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires the attacker to have contributor-level access, but the description mentions that the issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. If the attacker can exploit this without needing additional steps, maybe the complexity is Low. But I need to check if there's any additional steps required. Since the attacker just needs to input malicious code through the shortcode, maybe it's Low. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low privilege level. So PR:L. Wait, but the question says PR options are None, Low, High. Contributor-level access is considered a low privilege requirement because it's not admin. So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says the script executes when a user accesses the injected page. So the user has to visit the page, which implies some user interaction. But the attacker might have already injected the script, and the user just needs to click or view the page. However, the UI metric is about whether interaction is required. If the user has to take some action, like clicking a link, then UI:R. But if the script is automatically executed when the page is loaded, maybe UI:N. Wait, the description says \"execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the user just needs to access the page, which is part of normal browsing. So maybe UI:N. But sometimes, if the script is injected and the user has to click a link, that's UI:R. Hmm. The description says \"injected page\" so maybe the user has to navigate to that page, which is part of normal use. So UI:N. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The user interaction is required for the exploit to work? If the attacker injects the script into a page, and then the user visits that page, the script runs. So the user interaction is required for the exploit to be triggered. Therefore, UI:R. Wait, but the UI metric is about whether the user interaction is required for the exploit to be successful. If the attacker injects the script, and the user just needs to view the page, then the user interaction is required. So UI:R. But some sources say that if the exploit is triggered automatically upon page load, then UI:N. I need to check the CVSS guidelines. According to CVSS v3.1, UI:R means the user interaction is required for the exploit to be successful. If the user has to click a link or take some action, then it's R. If the exploit is triggered automatically, like when the page is loaded, then it's N. In this case, the script is injected into a page, and when the user accesses that page, the script runs. So the user has to access the page, which is part of normal browsing. So maybe UI:N. But the attacker has to have already injected the script, which might require some user interaction. Wait, the attacker is authenticated and can inject the script into the page. So the attacker can create a page with the malicious code, and then the user visits that page. So the user interaction is required for the exploit to be triggered. Therefore, UI:R. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me check the example. For example, if a vulnerability requires the user to click a link, then UI:R. If the script is executed automatically when the page is loaded, then UI:N. In this case, the user just needs to access the page, which is part of normal use. So maybe UI:N. But the attacker has to have already injected the script into the page. So the user interaction is required for the exploit to be triggered. Therefore, UI:R. I think I need to go with UI:R here.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts, which could affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The scope is Changed (C) if the attack affects a different component. But in this case, the attack is on the same component (the plugin's pages), so the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, the scope is about whether the attack can affect resources beyond those directly affected. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability to gain access to other parts of the system, then scope is Changed. But in this case, the attacker is injecting scripts into the plugin's pages, which are part of the same component. So the scope is Unchanged (U). So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The attacker can inject scripts, which could steal data. So confidentiality is High (H). Because the attacker can read sensitive information from the user's session or other data. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can inject scripts, which could modify data. So integrity is High (H). Because the attacker can alter the content of the pages. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A). The attacker could potentially cause denial of service by injecting scripts that consume resources. But the description doesn't mention availability issues. So A:N. Unless the script could cause a DoS, but the description doesn't specify that. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:L (Local), AC:L (Low complexity), PR:L (Low privileges), UI:R (User interaction required), S:U (Unchanged scope), C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nWait, but earlier I was confused about UI. Let me recheck. The user has to access the page, which is part of normal use. So maybe UI:N. If the user doesn't need to take any action beyond accessing the page, then UI:N. But if the attacker has to trick the user into visiting the page, that's UI:R. The description says \"execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the user just needs to access the page, which is part of normal browsing. Therefore, UI:N. So I think I made a mistake earlier. So UI:N.\n\nSo revising:\n\nUI:N.\n\nSo the vector would be:\n\nAV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nBut wait, the user interaction is required for the exploit to be successful. If the attacker injects the script into a page, and the user has to access that page, then the user interaction is required. So UI:R. But according to CVSS, UI:R means the user interaction is required for the exploit to be successful. If the user has to click a link or take some action, then it's R. If the script is executed automatically upon page load, then it's N. In this case, the user just needs to access the page, which is part of normal use. So maybe UI:N. But the attacker has to have already injected the script into the page. So the user interaction is required for the exploit to be triggered. Therefore, UI:R. I'm still confused. Let me check the CVSS documentation. According to the CVSS v3.1 specification, the User Interaction (UI) metric is \"None (N) if the attack can be performed without any user interaction, or Required (R) if the attack requires some form of user interaction.\" In this case, the user has to access the page that contains the injected script. So the user interaction is required for the exploit to be successful. Therefore, UI:R. So I think the correct value is UI:R.\n\nSo the final metrics would be:\n\nAV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nNow, constructing the vector string:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but the user interaction is required. Let me confirm again. If the user has to access the page, which is part of normal use, then maybe UI:N. But the attacker has to have already injected the script into the page. So the user interaction is required for the exploit to be triggered. Therefore, UI:R. I think that's the correct choice here.\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 1.1999999999999993, "success": true}

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Pago por Redsys plugin for WordPress. I need to determine the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, I'll recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The main ones are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a Reflected XSS, which means the attack is delivered via a link or some input that the user clicks on. Since the attacker needs the user to click a malicious link, the attack vector is Network (N). Because the user has to interact with the link, it's not local or physical. So AV:N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). Reflected XSS typically requires the attacker to craft a link that the user clicks. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any additional steps beyond creating the link. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior access or privileges. The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated attackers, so PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is Required (R) because the user has to click the malicious link for the attack to work. However, wait, the description says \"unauthenticated attackers can inject scripts if they can trick a user into performing an action like clicking a link.\" So the user interaction is required. But in some cases, if the attack is delivered via a link that the user clicks, does that count as UI:R? Yes, because the user has to take an action. So UI:R.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to elevate privileges or change the scope. The attack affects the same scope as the original component. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is None (N) because the XSS attack doesn't directly steal data, but the description says it's Reflected XSS, which can be used to steal data if the user is tricked into clicking. Wait, but the base metric for C is about the confidentiality impact. If the attacker can inject scripts, they might steal cookies or other data, so C could be High (H). Wait, but the question is about the base metrics. Let me check. For Reflected XSS, the confidentiality impact is typically High because the attacker can steal session cookies or other sensitive data. However, sometimes it's considered Low if the attack is not persistent. But in this case, the vulnerability is in a parameter that's used in the page, so the attacker can inject scripts that run in the context of the user's session. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I) is High (H) because the attacker can modify the page content, but in Reflected XSS, the attacker can inject scripts that alter the page's behavior. However, the integrity impact is about the ability to modify data. If the attacker can inject scripts, they might alter the page's content, so I:H.\n\nAvailability (A) is None (N) because the attack doesn't directly affect the availability of the service. The XSS attack doesn't cause denial of service, so A:N.\n\nWait, but I need to double-check each metric. Let me go through again.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): Network (N) because the attack is delivered via a link (network-based).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps, just create a link.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R) because the user must click the link.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't allow elevation of privilege.\n\nConfidentiality (C): High (H) because the attacker can steal data via XSS.\n\nIntegrity (I): High (H) because the attacker can inject scripts that alter the page's content.\n\nAvailability (A): None (N) because no impact on availability.\n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but some sources might consider UI:R as Required. Let me confirm. The user interaction is required for the attack to work, so UI:R is correct. So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a WordPress plugin vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via a shortcode, which is part of the plugin. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have contributor-level access, that suggests the attack is happening through the application's interface, which is local. But wait, the description says \"authenticated attackers with contributor-level access\" so maybe it's Local (L) because they need to be logged in. But sometimes, if the attack is through a network, like a remote exploit, it's Network (N). However, since the user has to be authenticated, maybe it's Local. Wait, but the plugin is part of WordPress, so maybe the attack is via the web interface, which is considered Local? Or is it Network? Hmm. Let me think. If the attacker is on the same network and can access the site, but the user has to be authenticated, maybe AV is Local. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the definition. Attack Vector is the path by which an attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, it's Local (L) because they have to be logged in. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping\". The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any special steps beyond providing the malicious input. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low privilege level. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but the question says \"authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above\". So the attacker needs to have at least contributor access, which is a low privilege level. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says the script executes when a user accesses the injected page. So the user has to visit the page, which implies that user interaction is required. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but sometimes if the script is injected and executed automatically, maybe UI is None. But the description says \"injected page\" which the user accesses. So the user has to click on the link, so UI is Required (R). But I'm not sure. Let me think again. If the attacker injects the script into a page, and then the user visits that page, the user interaction is required. So UI is Required (R). But some might argue that the user interaction is not required because the script is executed when the page is loaded. Wait, but the user has to access the page, which is part of the attack. So UI is Required (R). Hmm, but maybe the user doesn't need to interact beyond visiting the page. Wait, the CVSS UI metric is whether the user interaction is required for the exploit to succeed. If the attacker injects the script into a page, and then the user visits that page, the user interaction is required. So UI is Required (R). But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check. For example, if the attack requires the user to click a link, then UI is Required. If the script is executed automatically when the page is loaded, maybe UI is None. But in this case, the user has to access the page, which is part of the attack. So UI is Required (R). So I'll go with UI: Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts, which affects confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The scope is Changed (C) because the attack can affect resources beyond the ones directly impacted. For example, if the attacker can inject scripts that affect other users or the system, then the scope is changed. But in this case, the attack is on the user's own page, so maybe the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, the scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond those directly affected. If the attacker can inject scripts into the page, which affects the confidentiality (data leakage), integrity (modifying data), and availability (denial of service), but the scope is whether the attack can affect other components. Since the plugin is part of the WordPress site, and the attacker is authenticated, maybe the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, the scope is Changed (C) if the attack can affect resources beyond the ones directly impacted. For example, if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability to gain higher privileges or affect other parts of the system. In this case, the attacker is already authenticated, so the scope is Unchanged (U). So S: Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can inject scripts, which can steal data. So confidentiality is High (H). Because the attacker can read sensitive information from the user's session or other data.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject scripts, which can modify data. So integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The attacker can inject scripts that might cause denial of service, but the description doesn't mention that. So availability is None (N) unless there's a possibility of DoS. But the description doesn't specify that, so A is None (N).\n\nWait, but the description says \"inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the attacker can execute arbitrary scripts, which could lead to various impacts. But the CVSS metrics are based on the potential impact. So for confidentiality, the attacker can steal data (High). For integrity, they can modify data (High). For availability, maybe not directly, unless the script causes a DoS. But the description doesn't mention that, so A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the site.\n\nAC: Low (L) because the attack is straightforward with minimal complexity.\n\nPR: Low (L) because contributor access is required, which is a low privilege level.\n\nUI: Required (R) because the user has to access the injected page.\n\nS: Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope beyond the initial component.\n\nC: High (H) because data can be stolen.\n\nI: High (H) because data can be modified.\n\nA: None (N) because no availability impact is mentioned.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about UI. Let me check again. The user has to access the page, which is part of the attack. So the user interaction is required. So UI:R. But some might argue that the user interaction is not required because the script is executed when the page is loaded. However, the user has to visit the page, which is part of the attack. So UI is Required (R). So the answer should have UI:R.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Let me check the CVSS definitions. User Interaction (UI) is whether the user interaction is required for the exploit to succeed. If the attacker injects the script into a page, and the user has to visit that page for the script to execute, then the user interaction is required. So UI:R. Therefore, the vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 1.1999999999999993, "success": true}

An attacker can extract information from the database in function listCount in the WorkflowDAO interface. The workflowtype and status parameters can be used to build a SQL query.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring problem. The user provided a CVE description about a SQL Injection vulnerability in OpenMetadata <=1.4.1. I need to determine the base metrics and calculate the base score. Let me start by recalling the CVSS v3.1 base metrics and their definitions.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a SQL Injection in the WorkflowDAO interface, where parameters like workflowtype and status are used to build a SQL query. Since the attacker can exploit this through the application's interface, which is typically accessed over a network, AV should be Network (N). But wait, if the attack requires the attacker to be on the same network or have access to the application's input, maybe it's Network. But sometimes, if it's a local exploit, it might be Local. However, SQL Injection usually occurs through input parameters, which are part of the application's normal flow. So AV:N makes sense here.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says the attacker can use the workflowtype and status parameters to build a SQL query. If the attacker needs to manipulate these parameters, which are part of the input, the complexity might be Low (L) because it doesn't require special tools or knowledge beyond knowing the input points. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability allows extracting information from the database. Since the attacker doesn't need any prior privileges, PR is None (N). They can exploit it without being authenticated, so PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The attack can be done without any user interaction. The attacker just needs to send the malicious input, so UI:N.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability allows extracting information (confidentiality), but does it change the scope? If the attack affects the same component (like the database), then Scope is Unchanged (U). However, if the attack can lead to other components being affected, like escalating privileges, then it would be Changed (C). But the description mentions extracting information, which is a confidentiality issue. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The attacker can extract information from the database, which is a high confidentiality impact. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I). The vulnerability doesn't mention modifying data, so I:N.\n\nAvailability (A). Similarly, there's no mention of denial of service or availability impact, so A:N.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the attacker can extract information. So C is High. But what about Integrity and Availability? The description doesn't mention any changes to data or availability, so those are None. \n\nNow, putting it all together. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Let me check if that's correct. \n\nWait, the user's example had C:H, I:H, A:H. But in this case, the vulnerability is only about confidentiality. So I and A should be N. \n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let me recheck the CVE description. The attacker can extract information from the database. That's a confidentiality issue. The description doesn't mention any other impacts. So I and A are None. \n\nSo the final vector is AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. \n\nBut wait, sometimes SQL Injection can lead to other issues.

The user provided a CVE description, and I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let me start by recalling the CVSS v3.1 base metrics and their definitions.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attack can be initiated remotely. That usually points to Network (N) because the attacker doesn't need to be physically present or have local access. So AV:N makes sense here.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions that the exploit has been disclosed and may be used. But does it specify if the attack requires any specific conditions? The vulnerability is about improper authentication, which might be a low complexity attack since it's possible to exploit without needing complex steps. So AC:L seems right.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the vulnerability is about improper authentication, implying that no prior privileges are needed. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit it.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is None (N) because the attack can be initiated remotely without needing user interaction. The description doesn't mention any need for the user to click or do anything, so UI:N.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't change the scope. The impact is on the same component, so the scope isn't changed. Wait, but sometimes if the attack affects different components, it's changed. But here, the vulnerability is in a specific function, so probably S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is High (H) because improper authentication could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. The attacker might gain access to confidential information.\n\nIntegrity (I) is High (H) as well. If the attacker can bypass authentication, they might modify system settings or data, leading to integrity issues.\n\nAvailability (A) is High (H) because the vulnerability could be exploited to cause denial of service or other availability issues. The description mentions the exploit is public, so it's possible that the attack could lead to service disruption.\n\nPutting it all together, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.

The user provided a CVE description about Zammad 6.4.x before 6.4.2. The issue is information exposure where logged-in customers can see shared article drafts and manipulate them via API. \n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The problem says that a logged-in customer can access this information. Since the customer is authenticated, but the attack is happening through the browser console and API, which are network-based. So AV is Network (N) because the attack can be done over the network without needing physical access or local access.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions that the customer can see and manipulate drafts via API. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need special tools or steps; they just need to be logged in and access the API. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the customer is already authenticated. The vulnerability doesn't require additional privileges beyond being logged in. \n\nUser Interaction (UI) is None (N) because the customer can access the information without any interaction beyond being logged in. The attack can be done automatically via the API.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't change the scope. The attack affects the same component (the customer's own data) and doesn't allow elevation of privilege to another component.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is High (H) because the information exposed is confidential, like shared drafts. The customer shouldn't have access to this data, so there's a high confidentiality impact.\n\nIntegrity (I) is High (H) because the customer can manipulate the drafts via API. This allows unauthorized modification of data, which is a high integrity impact.\n\nAvailability (A) is None (N) because the issue doesn't affect the availability of the system. The problem is about data exposure and manipulation, not causing downtime or resource exhaustion.\n\nPutting it all together, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Let me double-check each metric to make sure. AV is network, AC is low, PR none, UI none, scope unchanged, confidentiality and integrity high, availability none. That seems right.

While 1.15.1 introduced a fix to restrict untrusted packages, the default setting of trusted packages still allows malicious classes from these packages to be executed. The exploit is only applicable if the client code of parquet-avro uses the \"specific\" or the \"reflect\" models deliberately for reading Parquet files. (\"generic\" model is not impacted) Users are recommended to upgrade to 1.15.2 or set the system property \"org.apache.parquet.avro.SERIALIZABLE_PACKAGES\" to an empty string on 1.15.1. Both are sufficient to fix the issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in the parquet-avro module of Apache Parquet. The main issue is that bad actors can execute arbitrary code through schema parsing. The fix was introduced in 1.15.1, but the default setting still allows malicious classes to run if the client uses specific or reflect models.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is triggered when the client code uses specific or reflect models. Since the exploit requires the client to use these models, which are part of the application's code, the attack vector is likely Local (L). Wait, but maybe it's Network (N) if the attacker can send malicious data over the network. Hmm. The description says the exploit is applicable if the client uses those models. So the attacker would need to have access to the client's code or the data being processed. If the client is running on the same system, then it's Local. But if the attacker can send malicious data over the network, then it's Network. The description doesn't specify, but since it's about schema parsing, maybe the attack is through the network. Wait, but the exploit requires the client to use specific or reflect models. So the attacker would need to have the client code using those models, which might be part of the application's setup. So maybe AV is Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the client's code or the data being processed. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. If the client is a remote service, then the attacker could send malicious data over the network, making AV Network. But if the client is on the same system, then Local. The description doesn't specify, but since it's a module used in applications, maybe the attack vector is Local. But I'm not certain. Let me check other metrics to see if that helps.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The fix in 1.15.1 restricts untrusted packages, but the default still allows malicious classes. The exploit requires the client to use specific or reflect models. So the complexity might be Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to have high technical skills to exploit it. But maybe it's High (H) if the attacker needs to set up the client to use those models. Hmm. The description says the exploit is only applicable if the client uses those models. So the attacker needs to have the client code configured that way. That might be considered a low complexity because it's not a complex setup, but maybe it's high because the attacker has to know about the specific models. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think of similar vulnerabilities. If the attack requires the user to have certain configurations, maybe it's Low complexity. But I'm not sure. Let's move on and come back.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution. So the attacker doesn't need any privileges, right? Because they can execute code without needing to be an admin. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The exploit is triggered by the client using specific models, which is part of the application's setup. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new attack vector that affects a different component. Since the exploit allows arbitrary code execution, which could lead to taking control of the system, the scope is Changed (C). Wait, but the original component is the parquet-avro module. If the attacker can execute code, that's a change in scope because it's not just affecting the same component but potentially the entire system. So S is Changed (C).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The exploit allows arbitrary code execution, which could lead to data theft. So Confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can execute code, which could modify data or system files. So Integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The attacker could potentially cause denial of service by executing malicious code. So Availability is High (H).\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original description says that the exploit allows bad actors to execute arbitrary code. So that's a high impact on all three aspects: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. So C, I, A are all High (H). \n\nNow, going back to AV. If the attack requires the client to use specific models, which is part of the application's configuration, then the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the client's code or the data being processed. But if the client is a remote service, then the attack vector is Network (N). The description doesn't specify, but since it's a module used in applications, maybe the attack is through the network. Wait, but the exploit is triggered when the client uses specific models. So the attacker would need to have the client code using those models, which might be part of the application's setup. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the client's code or the data being processed. Alternatively, if the client is a remote service, then the attack vector is Network (N). But the description doesn't specify. However, in many cases, such vulnerabilities are considered Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the system where the code is running. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think of similar examples. For example, if a vulnerability in a library allows code execution when the library is used, the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to have the library in use. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The fix in 1.15.1 restricts untrusted packages, but the default still allows malicious classes. The exploit requires the client to use specific or reflect models. So the complexity is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to have high technical skills to exploit it. They just need to have the client code configured to use those models. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Changed (C)\nC: High (H)\nI: High (H)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about AV. Let me check again. If the attack is through the network, then AV is Network (N). But the description says the exploit is applicable if the client uses specific or reflect models. So the attacker would need to have the client code using those models. If the client is a remote service, then the attacker can send malicious data over the network, making AV Network (N). But if the client is on the same system, then Local (L). Since the description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is in a module used by applications, it's possible that the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to have the client code using those models. However, if the client is a remote service, then it's Network. But without more info, I think the safest assumption is Local (L) because the attack requires the client to be configured in a certain way, which is part of the application's setup. So AV is Local (L).\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.5, "success": true}

Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /app-api/infra/file/upload of the component Front-End Store Interface. The manipulation of the argument path leads to path traversal. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to parse the CVE description and map each metric correctly. Let me start by recalling the base metrics for CVSS v3.1.\n\nThe CVE says the vulnerability is in the Front-End Store Interface's upload endpoint, specifically the 'path' argument leading to path traversal. The attack can be launched remotely, which probably affects the Attack Vector (AV). Since it's a remote attack, AV is likely Network (N). \n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is about how complex it is for an attacker to exploit. The description doesn't mention any complexity, so I'll assume it's Low (L) unless there's a reason to think it's high. \n\nPrivileges Required (PR) – the vulnerability allows exploitation without needing any prior access, so PR is None (N). \n\nUser Interaction (UI) – the exploit doesn't require user interaction, so UI is None (N). \n\nScope (S) – the vulnerability affects the same component, so Scope is Unchanged (U). \n\nConfidentiality (C) – path traversal could allow reading files, so Confidentiality is High (H). \n\nIntegrity (I) – if the attacker can modify files, then Integrity is High (H). But the description mentions path traversal, which is more about reading than modifying. Wait, but if the attacker can traverse to a file and overwrite it, that would affect integrity. However, the description says \"manipulation of the argument path leads to path traversal.\" So maybe the attacker can read files, which affects confidentiality. But if they can write, that's integrity. The description doesn't specify if they can modify files, so maybe I should assume that path traversal could allow both reading and writing. But the problem is, the description doesn't explicitly state that. Hmm. Maybe the default is to assume that path traversal could lead to both, but since the description doesn't mention modification, maybe I should go with High for both C and I? Or maybe only C is High. Wait, the CVSS scoring requires that if the vulnerability affects confidentiality, integrity, or availability, then the corresponding metric is set. Since the vulnerability is path traversal, which can lead to unauthorized access to files (confidentiality), but if the attacker can overwrite files, that's integrity. However, the description doesn't mention modification. So maybe only confidentiality is affected. But I'm not sure. Let me check the original description again. It says \"manipulation of the argument path leads to path traversal.\" So the attacker can access files outside the intended directory. That would be confidentiality. But if the attacker can write to those files, that's integrity. However, the description doesn't mention that. So maybe I should assume that only confidentiality is affected. But in some cases, path traversal can allow both. But without explicit info, maybe I should go with High for C and N for I and A. Wait, but the vendor didn't respond, and the exploit is public. The CVSS score is based on the potential impact. So if the vulnerability allows reading files, that's C:H. If it allows writing, that's I:H. But the description doesn't say. So maybe the answer is C:H, I:N, A:N? Or maybe the default is to assume that path traversal could allow both. But I need to be precise. Let me think again. The problem states that the attack may be launched remotely, and the exploit is public. The vulnerability is in the upload endpoint. So if the attacker can manipulate the path, they might be able to read files (C:H) or write files (I:H). But the description doesn't specify. However, in the absence of specific info, maybe the default is to assume that the vulnerability could affect all three (C, I, A) if possible. But I need to make a judgment. Since the description mentions path traversal, which is typically about reading, but in some cases, upload could allow writing. However, the description says \"manipulation of the argument path leads to path traversal.\" So maybe the attacker can access files, which is confidentiality. But if the upload is a file upload, maybe the attacker can overwrite existing files, which would be integrity. But the description doesn't mention that. So perhaps the answer is C:H, I:N, A:N. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the attack could lead to both. But without explicit info, I should go with the most likely. Let me check the original CVE description again. The description says \"manipulation of the argument path leads to path traversal.\" So the attacker can access files, which is confidentiality. But if the upload is a file upload, maybe the attacker can overwrite files, which would be integrity. However, the description doesn't mention that. So maybe the answer is C:H, I:N, A:N. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the attack could lead to all three. But I need to make a choice here. Let me proceed with C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the problem says the vulnerability is critical, which would imply high impact. So maybe all three are high. But I need to check the metrics again. \n\nWait, the CVSS v3.1 base metrics: \n\n- C: High if the confidentiality is compromised. \n- I: High if the integrity is compromised. \n- A: High if the availability is compromised. \n\nIn this case, path traversal could allow reading files (C:H), but if the attacker can write to files (like overwriting), that's I:H. But the description doesn't mention that. However, since the vulnerability is in the upload endpoint, maybe the attacker can upload files to arbitrary locations, which would allow both reading and writing. So maybe C:H and I:H. But the description doesn't specify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the attack is only about reading, so C:H, I:N, A:N. \n\nBut the problem states that the vulnerability is critical, which would suggest that the impact is high. So maybe all three are high. But I need to be precise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the attack allows the attacker to read files (C:H) and possibly overwrite files (I:H), but since the description doesn't mention that, maybe I should only assign C:H. \n\nHmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The description says \"manipulation of the argument path leads to path traversal.\" So the attacker can access files outside the intended directory. That would be confidentiality. But if the attacker can write to those files, that's integrity. However, the description doesn't mention that. So maybe the answer is C:H, I:N, A:N. \n\nBut the vendor didn't respond, and the exploit is public. The CVSS score is based on the potential impact. So if the vulnerability allows reading files, that's C:H. If it allows writing, that's I:H. But without explicit info, I should go with the most likely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the attack could lead to all three. But I need to make a choice. \n\nLet me check the original CVE description again. The vulnerability is in the upload endpoint. So if the attacker can manipulate the path, they might be able to upload files to arbitrary locations, which would allow writing (integrity) and reading (confidentiality). But the description doesn't specify. \n\nIn the absence of explicit information, I think the safest assumption is that the vulnerability allows reading files (C:H) and possibly writing (I:H), but since the description doesn't mention writing, maybe I should only assign C:H. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the attack could lead to all three. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, the problem says the vulnerability is classified as critical. Critical in CVSS terms usually means that the impact is high for all three metrics. So maybe C:H, I:H, A:H. But I need to check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the attack allows the attacker to read files (C:H), but not modify them (I:N), and not affect availability (A:N). \n\nBut the problem states that the exploit is public and may be used. So the impact is high. \n\nHmm. This is a bit tricky. Let me proceed with the following assumptions:\n\n- AV: Network (N) because the attack is remote.\n- AC: Low (L) because no complexity is mentioned.\n- PR: None (N) because no privileges are needed.\n- UI: None (N) because no user interaction is required.\n- S: Unchanged (U) because the scope is the same component.\n- C: High (H) because path traversal allows reading files.\n- I: High (H) because the upload endpoint might allow writing to files.\n- A: None (N) because the description doesn't mention availability impact.\n\nBut I'm not sure about I.

The user provided a CVE description for Adobe Commerce versions with an Improper Access Control vulnerability. The goal is to determine each base metric and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The metrics are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attacker is a low-privileged one who can bypass security measures. The vulnerability allows unauthorized read access. Since the attacker doesn't need user interaction and can exploit it remotely, I think AV is Network (N). Wait, but the description mentions \"low-privileged attacker\" and \"bypass security measures\". Wait, the exploit doesn't require user interaction, so maybe it's network-based. But I need to check if the attack is through a network or local. The description says \"could result in a Security feature bypass\" and \"exploitation does not require user interaction.\" So maybe the attack is via network, but I need to be careful. If the attacker is local, then AV would be Local (L). But the description doesn't specify if it's local or remote. Wait, the vulnerability is about access control, so maybe it's possible that the attacker is local. But the description says \"low-privileged attacker could leverage this vulnerability to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized read access.\" If the attacker is local, then AV would be Local. But if the attacker can exploit it remotely, then AV is Network. The description doesn't explicitly say, but the fact that it's a security feature bypass might imply that the attacker is within the system, but maybe not. Hmm. Wait, the user says \"Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.\" That suggests that the attack can be done without user interaction, which could be either local or remote. But the attack vector is about how the attacker can reach the vulnerability. If the attacker is on the same network, then AV is Network. If it's local, then AV is Local. Since the description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is about access control, maybe it's local. Wait, but the problem says \"low-privileged attacker could leverage this vulnerability to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized read access.\" If the attacker is a low-privileged user, that might imply that they are local, as they have some access. So AV would be Local (L). Wait, but maybe the attacker can exploit it remotely. For example, if the vulnerability is in a web application, then the attack vector would be Network. But the description doesn't specify. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The problem says \"low-privileged attacker could leverage this vulnerability to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized read access.\" If the attacker is a low-privileged user, that might mean they are local, but maybe the vulnerability allows remote access. Since the description doesn't specify, but the CVSS requires choosing based on the description. The key is that the attack doesn't require user interaction. So, if the attack is possible without user interaction, it could be either local or network. But the default for AV when not specified is Network? Or is there a way to infer? Wait, the CVSS guidelines for AV: Network (N) means the attack is delivered over a network, Adjacent (A) is nearby, Local (L) is same system, Physical (P) is physical access. Since the description doesn't mention anything about the attacker being adjacent or physical, and the attack doesn't require user interaction, maybe it's Network. But if the attacker is local, then AV is Local. But how to decide? The problem says \"low-privileged attacker\" which might imply that the attacker is local. For example, if the attacker is a user with low privileges on the system, then AV is Local. But if the attacker is an external user exploiting a web vulnerability, then AV is Network. Since the product is Adobe Commerce, which is a web application, maybe the attack is via the web, so AV is Network. But the description says \"low-privileged attacker\" which could be a user with access to the system. Hmm. This is tricky. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example answer has AV:N, which is Network. So maybe the answer here is AV:N. But I need to justify. The description says \"low-privileged attacker could leverage this vulnerability to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized read access. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.\" So the attacker can exploit it without user interaction, which could be either local or remote. But since it's a security feature bypass, maybe it's a remote attack. For example, if the vulnerability is in the web application, then the attacker can exploit it remotely. So AV:N. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me proceed with AV:N for now.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says \"low-privileged attacker could leverage this vulnerability\". The complexity is whether the attack requires multiple steps or not. If the attack is simple, then AC is Low (L). The description doesn't mention complexity, but since it's a vulnerability that can be exploited by a low-privileged attacker without user interaction, it's likely that the attack complexity is Low. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker is low-privileged, so PR is Low (L). Wait, the description says \"low-privileged attacker could leverage this vulnerability\". So the attacker already has low privileges, but the vulnerability allows them to bypass security measures. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some privileges to exploit it. Wait, PR is the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already low-privileged, then PR is Low. So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says \"Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.\" So UI:N.\n\nScope (S): Scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The description says \"bypass security measures and gain unauthorized read access.\" If the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain access to data (confidentiality), but doesn't change the scope (i.e., the same component is affected), then S:U. But if the attacker can gain access to other components, then S:C. The description doesn't mention changing the scope, so S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can gain unauthorized read access, so C is High (H). Because confidentiality is about data confidentiality. If the attacker can read data, that's a high impact.\n\nIntegrity (I): The description doesn't mention any changes to data integrity. So I:N.\n\nAvailability (A): The description doesn't mention any impact on availability. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:L (Low), UI:N (None), S:U (Unchanged), C:H (High), I:N (None), A:N (None).\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\nWait, but the example given in the problem's final line example has C:H, I:H, A:H. But in this case, the description only mentions unauthorized read access, which is confidentiality. So I and A are not affected. So the answer should have C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nBut let me double-check. The problem says \"gain unauthorized read access\" which is confidentiality. So C:H. Integrity (I) is about data integrity, which isn't mentioned. Availability (A) is about system availability, which isn't mentioned. So I:N and A:N.\n\nBut wait, the example in the problem's final line example has C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. The actual answer depends on the description. So in this case, the answer should be C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nSo the vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\nBut wait, the user's example answer has C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The description says \"gain unauthorized read access\" which is confidentiality. So C:H. The other metrics are not mentioned, so I and A are N. So the answer should be as above.\n\nBut wait, maybe the attack could also affect integrity or availability. The description says \"Security feature bypass\" which could imply that the attacker can bypass security measures, which might allow them to modify data (integrity) or cause denial of service (availability). But the description doesn't mention that. The only thing mentioned is unauthorized read access. So I think I and A are N.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Despite CSRF protection preventing file uploads, the application still processes multipart boundaries, leading to resource exhaustion. By appending additional characters to the multipart boundary, an attacker can cause the server to parse each byte of the boundary, ultimately leading to service unavailability. This vulnerability is present in the `/upload_avatar`, `/upload_app`, and `/upload_logo` endpoints.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a DoS in multiple file upload endpoints of a specific web app. The exploit is via CSRF, which is a remote attack. The attacker can append characters to the multipart boundary, causing the server to parse each byte, leading to resource exhaustion and service unavailability.\n\nStarting with the base metrics. Let's go step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is exploited remotely via CSRF. CSRF typically requires the user to be authenticated and the attacker to trick them into making a request. But since the attack is remote, the vector is Network (N). Wait, but CSRF is usually considered a local attack because it requires the user to be logged in. Hmm, but the description says it's remotely exploitable. Wait, the user might be tricked into clicking a link, which is a remote attack. So AV is Network (N) because the attacker can exploit it from a remote network. But I need to check the CVSS guidelines. For CSRF, the attack vector is usually considered as Network (N) because the attacker can send a request from a remote location. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The attacker needs to append characters to the boundary. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to have any special skills beyond appending characters. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have the user's session to perform CSRF. But the description says that CSRF protection is in place, but the application still processes multipart boundaries. So the attacker must have the user's session, which implies that the attacker needs to have some level of user privileges. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since the attack is via CSRF, the attacker needs the user to be authenticated. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs the user's session, which is a low privilege requirement. Wait, but if the user is already authenticated, maybe the PR is None (N)? Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without needing any privileges beyond the user's existing session, then PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have the user's session. But according to CVSS, PR is None if the attacker doesn't need any privileges beyond what's already required for the attack. Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me think again. The PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have the user's session (i.e., the user is authenticated), then the PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have the user's credentials. But if the attack doesn't require any additional privileges beyond what's already present (like the user is already logged in), then PR is Low. Alternatively, if the attacker can exploit it without needing any privileges, then PR is None. But in this case, the attacker must have the user's session to perform the CSRF, so PR is Low (L). Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have the user's session, that's a low privilege requirement. So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack requires the user to be tricked into clicking a link or submitting a form, which is a form of user interaction. So UI:R (Required). Because the attacker needs the user to interact with the malicious request.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the server processing the upload), so the scope is Unchanged (U). Because the attack doesn't change the scope; it's the same component. Wait, but the vulnerability leads to resource exhaustion, which could be considered a different scope. Wait, the Scope metric is about whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new attack vector that affects a different component. In this case, the attack is on the same component (the server processing the upload), so the scope is Unchanged (U). So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability leads to resource exhaustion, which is an availability issue. But does it affect confidentiality? The description says the server processes the multipart boundaries, leading to resource exhaustion. So the confidentiality is not directly affected. So C:N.\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the integrity isn't directly affected. The server is processing the request, but the data being processed is the multipart boundary. The attacker is causing the server to consume resources, but not modifying data. So I:N.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability causes service unavailability, which is a high impact. So A:H.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The CVSS metrics for each impact. For example, if the vulnerability leads to DoS, then Availability is High. So A:H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (remote), AC:L (low complexity), PR:L (low privileges), UI:R (user interaction required), S:U (scope unchanged), C:N, I:N, A:H.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the PR is correct. The PR is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since the attack is via CSRF, the attacker needs the user to be authenticated. So the attacker needs to have the user's session, which is a low privilege requirement. So PR:L. But some sources might say that if the attacker needs to have the user's session, then PR is Low. Alternatively, if the attacker can exploit it without needing any privileges beyond the user's existing session, then PR is Low. So I think PR:L is correct here.\n\nAnother point: the user interaction is required because the attacker has to trick the user into making the request. So UI:R.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.7999999999999998, "success": true}

The user provided a CVE description for Adobe Commerce versions with an Incorrect Authorization vulnerability. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, let's go through each metric one by one. \n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attacker is a low privileged one, but how does the attack vector work? The vulnerability is a security feature bypass, which might be exploited remotely. But the description doesn't specify if it's network-based or local. Wait, the user mentioned \"low privileged attacker\" which might imply local access, but the exploit doesn't require user interaction. Hmm. Wait, the description says \"Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.\" So maybe the attack is local? Or could it be network? Let me think. If the attacker is low privileged, maybe they have local access. But sometimes, even local attacks can be considered as network if they're through a service. Wait, the attack vector is about how the attacker can reach the component. If the vulnerability is in a web application, maybe the attack vector is network (N) because the attacker can exploit it remotely. But the description says \"low privileged attacker\" which might mean they have local access. Wait, but the exact wording is \"low privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform actions with permissions that were not granted.\" So maybe the attacker is local, but with low privileges. So AV would be Local (L)? Or maybe Network (N) if the attack is through a network service. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example answer has AV:N, which is Network. But in this case, the attack might be local. Wait, the problem says \"low privileged attacker\" which could imply that the attacker is already on the system, so AV would be Local (L). But maybe the attack is through a network service. Wait, the description doesn't specify. Maybe I need to make an assumption here. Since the vulnerability is an authorization bypass, it's possible that the attacker can exploit it remotely, so AV:N. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. If the attacker is a low privileged user, maybe they have local access. But if the vulnerability is in a web application, then the attack vector is network. For example, if the attacker can send a request to the server, then AV:N. But if the attacker needs to be on the same system, then AV:L. The description doesn't specify, but the example given in the problem's final line has AV:N. Maybe the answer here is AV:N. Let me note that and proceed.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says \"low privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability\". The attack complexity is about how hard it is to exploit. If the attacker needs to have low privileges, maybe the complexity is Low (L). But the problem says \"low privileged attacker\" which might mean that the attack is simple, so AC:L. But I need to check. The attack complexity is whether the attacker needs to have some specific conditions. If the attack requires the attacker to have certain privileges, that's part of PR. So AC is about the complexity of the attack, not the privileges. If the attack is straightforward, then AC:L. The description doesn't mention any complexity, so maybe AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker is low privileged, so PR:L. Because the attacker needs to have low privileges to exploit the vulnerability. Wait, but the description says \"low privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform actions with permissions that were not granted\". So the attacker is already low privileged, but the vulnerability allows them to bypass authorization. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some privileges to exploit it. Wait, but PR is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already low privileged, then PR:L. So yes, PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says \"Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.\" So UI:N.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The description says the impact is High to confidentiality and Low to integrity. Since the scope is unchanged (the same component is affected), S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): High impact, so C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I): Low impact, so I:L.\n\nAvailability (A): The description doesn't mention availability impact, so A:N.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"both a High impact to confidentiality and Low impact to integrity.\" So C:H and I:L. Availability is not mentioned, so A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (assuming network attack)\nAC: L\nPR: L\nUI: N\nS: U\nC: H\nI: L\nA: N\n\nBut wait, earlier I was confused about AV. Let me recheck. If the attack is through a network, then AV:N. If it's local, AV:L. The description says \"low privileged attacker\" which might imply that the attacker is local. But if the vulnerability is in a web application, then the attack is network-based. For example, if the attacker can send a request to the server, then AV:N. But if the attacker needs to be on the same system, then AV:L. The problem states that the attacker is low privileged, which could mean they have local access. However, in many cases, such vulnerabilities are exploited remotely. For example, if the application is a web service, then the attack vector is network. But the description doesn't specify. However, the example given in the problem's final line has AV:N, so maybe the answer here is AV:N. Alternatively, maybe the attack is local. But without more info, I think the safest assumption is AV:N. \n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N. Wait, but the example in the problem's final line has PR:N. Wait, the example given in the problem's final line is Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. But in this case, the PR is L. Wait, the user's description says \"low privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability\". So the attacker needs to have low privileges. So PR:L. But in the example, PR:N. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the PR definition. PR is the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already low privileged, then PR:L. But if the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, then PR:N. Wait, the description says \"low privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability\". So the attacker needs to have low privileges to exploit it. Therefore, PR:L. So the example in the problem's final line might be different. But in this case, the answer should be PR:L. \n\nWait, but the example given in the problem's final line is for a different CVE. Let me focus on the current problem. The user's CVE says that the attacker is low privileged. So PR:L. \n\nSo the vector would be AV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:L, A:N. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"low privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform actions with permissions that were not granted leading to both a High impact to confidentiality and Low impact to integrity.\" So the attacker is low privileged, but the vulnerability allows them to bypass authorization. So the PR is Low because the attacker needs to have low privileges to exploit it. \n\nSo the final vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N. \n\nBut I need to make sure all the metrics are correct. Let me check again:\n\n- AV: Network (N) because the attack is through the network (assuming the application is a web service, which is common for such vulnerabilities)\n- AC: Low (L) because the attack is straightforward\n- PR: Low (L) because the attacker needs to have low privileges\n- UI: None (N) as no user interaction is required\n- S: Unchanged (U) because the scope is the same component\n- C: High (H) as confidentiality is impacted\n- I: Low (L) as integrity is impacted\n- A: None (N) as availability is not mentioned\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final answer should be the vector string as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

The user provided a CVE description, and I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let me start by breaking down the description.\n\nFirst, the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write in decoding a frame buffer in libsthmbc.so. The description says it allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code with privilege. Also, user interaction is required to trigger this.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The attacker is local, so AV should be Local (L). Because the vulnerability is in a library that's part of the system, local access is needed. So AV:L.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description doesn't mention anything about complexity. Since the exploit requires some steps but the user interaction is required, maybe AC is High? Wait, the user interaction is part of the UI metric, not AC. So AC is Low (L) because the attack doesn't require complex steps. Unless the exploit is complicated, but the description doesn't specify. So I'll go with AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to have local access, but the vulnerability allows execution with privilege. Wait, the description says \"execute arbitrary code with privilege.\" So maybe the attacker needs to have some privileges already. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is local, maybe they already have some privileges. But the description says \"local attackers can execute arbitrary code with privilege,\" which might mean that the exploit requires the attacker to have some level of privilege. However, the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, maybe PR is Low (L) because they can exploit it without needing higher privileges. Wait, but the description says \"execute arbitrary code with privilege,\" which might imply that the exploit requires the attacker to have certain privileges. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The PR metric is about the level of privileges the attacker needs to have before exploiting the vulnerability. If the attacker is local, they might already have some privileges, but if the exploit requires them to have higher privileges, then PR would be High. But the description doesn't specify that. Since the attacker is local, maybe PR is Low (L) because they can exploit it without needing additional privileges beyond being local. So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says user interaction is required for triggering the vulnerability. So UI:R (Required).\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The description says the attacker can execute arbitrary code with privilege. If the exploit allows the attacker to gain higher privileges (like root), then the scope would be Changed (C). But the description says \"execute arbitrary code with privilege,\" which might mean that the attacker can elevate privileges. So S:C.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution, which could lead to data disclosure. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). Since the attacker can execute code, they can modify data. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A). The exploit could lead to denial of service, so A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:R, S:C, C:H, I:H, A:H. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H. Wait, but the user interaction is required, so UI:R. Let me check again. The description says user interaction is required for triggering the vulnerability. So UI:R is correct. Scope is Changed because the attacker can execute code with higher privileges, which changes the scope. So S:C. That makes sense. So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.39999999999999947, "success": true}

Prior to version 1.8.179, there is no check to ensure that the user is disabling notifications for the mailbox to which they already have access. Moreover, the code explicitly implements functionality that if the user does not have access to the mailbox, then after disabling (enabling) notifications for this mailbox, the user will gain access to it. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.179.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring problem. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The issue is in FreeScout, a help desk software. The problem is that before version 1.8.179, there's no check to ensure a user is disabling notifications for a mailbox they already have access to. Additionally, the code allows a user without access to gain access by disabling or enabling notifications for a mailbox.\n\nSo, the main vulnerability here is that a user without access can gain access by manipulating notification settings. Let me break down the metrics one by one.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The user needs to be able to access the mailbox's notification settings. Since the user is already authenticated (they have access to the system), the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the user is interacting with their own account. But wait, the description mentions that the user doesn't have access to the mailbox but can gain access by changing notifications. So maybe the attack is through the application's interface, which would be Local. But if the user is already authenticated, then AV is Local. However, if the attack requires the user to be on the same network or something else, maybe Network? Wait, the user is already logged in, so the attack is within the application, so AV is Local. So AV: L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The code doesn't have a check, so the user can just disable notifications and gain access. This seems like a low complexity because the attacker doesn't need any special tools or steps beyond the existing functionality. So AC: L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The user needs to be authenticated to access the notification settings. So the attacker must already have an account, which means PR is Low (L) because they need some privileges (being logged in) but not administrative. Wait, but the user might not have access to the mailbox, but they can gain access by changing the notification. So the attacker needs to be authenticated, which is a low privilege requirement. So PR: L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The user has to perform the action of disabling notifications. The description says \"the user does not have access to the mailbox, then after disabling (enabling) notifications for this mailbox, the user will gain access.\" So the user has to take an action, which is part of the attack. But does this require user interaction? The user is already logged in, so the attack is initiated by the user. However, the UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. Since the user is already authenticated and can perform the action themselves, maybe UI is None (N). Wait, but the user has to actively disable notifications. However, in some cases, if the attack is automated, maybe UI is not required. But the description doesn't mention any external factors. So maybe UI is None (N) because the user can perform the action without needing any external input. Hmm, but the user is already logged in, so the attack is part of their normal interaction. So UI: N.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain access to a different component or privilege level. In this case, the user gains access to a mailbox they didn't have before. So the scope is Changed (C) because the attack changes the privileges of the user. So S: C.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The user gains access to the mailbox, which implies they can read data. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can access sensitive information. So C: H.\n\nIntegrity (I). The user can modify the mailbox's notification settings, but does that affect integrity? The main issue is gaining access, which is more about confidentiality. However, if the user can modify data, then integrity would be affected. But the description says the user gains access, not that they can modify data. So maybe integrity is None (N). Wait, but the user can access the mailbox, which might allow them to modify data. However, the original issue is about gaining access, not about modifying data. The problem is that the user can access the mailbox, which is a confidentiality issue. So I: N.\n\nAvailability (A). The issue doesn't mention any denial of service or resource exhaustion. So availability is None (N). So A: N.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The user can gain access to the mailbox, which might allow them to read data (confidentiality) and possibly modify data (integrity). But the original problem is that the user can gain access by changing the notification settings. So the main impact is on confidentiality. However, if the user can access the mailbox, they might be able to modify data, which would affect integrity. But the description doesn't specify that. The problem is that the user can access the mailbox, which is a confidentiality issue. So maybe I: N. But if the user can access the mailbox, they can read and write, so both C and I would be High. Wait, but the original issue is that the user can gain access, which is a confidentiality issue. However, the code allows the user to gain access by changing the notification settings. So the user can access the mailbox, which would allow them to read (C) and possibly write (I). But the problem is that the user can access the mailbox, which is a confidentiality issue. However, the description doesn't mention that the user can modify data. So maybe I: N. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The user can access the mailbox, which implies they can read data (C: H) and possibly modify data (I: H). But the original issue is that the user can gain access, which is a confidentiality issue. However, the code allows the user to gain access, which might allow them to read and write. So maybe both C and I are High. But the problem is that the user can access the mailbox, which is a confidentiality issue. So C: H. For integrity, if the user can modify data, then I: H. But the description doesn't mention that. The problem is that the user can access the mailbox, which is a confidentiality issue. So maybe I: N. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original description again. The code explicitly implements functionality that if the user does not have access to the mailbox, then after disabling (enabling) notifications for this mailbox, the user will gain access to it. So the user can gain access to the mailbox by changing the notification settings. So the user can access the mailbox, which would allow them to read (C) and possibly write (I). But the problem is that the user can access the mailbox, which is a confidentiality issue. However, the original issue is about gaining access, not about modifying data. So maybe the integrity is not affected. Therefore, I: N. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the user can access the mailbox, they can read and write, so both C and I are High. But the problem is that the user can access the mailbox, which is a confidentiality issue. So C: H, I: N. Or maybe I: H. This is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The user can access the mailbox, which is a confidentiality issue. But the code allows the user to gain access, which might allow them to read and write. However, the original problem is that the user can access the mailbox, which is a confidentiality issue. So C: H. For integrity, if the user can modify data, then I: H. But the description doesn't mention that. So maybe I: N. Alternatively, the user can access the mailbox, which might allow them to modify data, so I: H. But without explicit mention, it's safer to assume that the main impact is confidentiality. So I: N. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local, since the user is authenticated and interacts with their own account)\nAC: L (Low complexity, no special steps needed)\nPR: L (Low, requires authentication)\nUI: N (No user interaction needed, the user can perform the action themselves)\nS: C (Scope changed, user gains access to a new mailbox)\nC: H (High confidentiality impact)\nI: N (No integrity impact)\nA: N (No availability impact)\n\nWait, but the user can access the mailbox, which might allow them to read data (C: H) and possibly modify data (I: H). But the problem is that the user can access the mailbox, which is a confidentiality issue. However, the original issue is that the user can gain access, which is a confidentiality issue. So maybe I: N. But I'm not sure. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. The integrity metric is about the ability to modify data. If the user can access the mailbox, they can read and write, so both C and I would be High. But the problem is that the user can access the mailbox, which is a confidentiality issue. However, the code allows the user to gain access, which might allow them to modify data. But the description doesn't mention that. So maybe I: N. \n\nAlternatively, if the user can access the mailbox, they can read and write, so both C and I are High. But the original issue is about gaining access, which is a confidentiality issue. So maybe I: N. \n\nHmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original CVE description again. The problem is that the user can gain access to the mailbox by changing the notification settings. So the user can access the mailbox, which would allow them to read (C) and possibly write (I). But the description doesn't mention that the user can modify data.

The vulnerable sockets were set to listen on all network interfaces, increasing the likelihood that an attacker is able to reach the vulnerable ZeroMQ sockets to carry out an attack. vLLM instances that do not make use of the mooncake integration are not vulnerable.

I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the attack vector (AV). The description says the vulnerability is due to using pickle-based serialization over unsecured ZeroMQ sockets that listen on all network interfaces. Since the sockets are listening on all interfaces, an attacker can reach them remotely. So AV should be Network (N).\n\nNext, attack complexity (AC). The vulnerability is due to the use of pickle, which might require the attacker to send a malicious payload.

First, I need to parse the CVE description and map each metric correctly. Let me start by recalling the base metrics for CVSS v3.1.\n\nThe CVE says the vulnerability is in the downloadSoftware function, which allows path traversal via the filename argument. The attack can be initiated remotely, so that's a key point. Let me go through each metric one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The attack is remote, so AV should be Network (N). Because the attacker doesn't need to be physically present or adjacent; they can exploit it over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description mentions that the exploit is public and may be used. But does it require any specific complexity? The path traversal is likely a low complexity attack since it's a simple argument manipulation. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability doesn't mention needing any specific privileges. The attacker can exploit it without needing to be authenticated, so PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The exploit is public and can be used without user interaction. The description doesn't mention any need for user action, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope refers to whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the downloadSoftware function, which is part of the same component (the software itself), the scope is Unchanged (U). Unless the exploit affects other components, but the description doesn't indicate that.\n\nConfidentiality (C): Path traversal could allow reading files, so confidentiality is High (H). The attacker might access sensitive data.\n\nIntegrity (I): If the attacker can modify files via path traversal, then integrity is High (H). But the description says the function is for downloading software, so maybe the attacker can overwrite files, leading to integrity issues.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability is about path traversal, which might not directly affect availability. Unless the exploit causes denial of service, but the description doesn't mention that. So Availability is None (N).\n\nWait, but the description says the exploit is public and may be used.

The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in WeGIA. The main issue is that the server doesn't validate the length of the fid parameter in HTTP GET requests, leading to a DoS attack.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in an HTTP GET request, which is a network-based attack. So AV should be Network (N). \n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says the server processes URLs up to 8,142 characters. The attacker doesn't need any special tools or steps beyond sending a long request. So the complexity is Low (L) because it's easy to exploit without needing any additional setup.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior access or privileges. They can exploit this from the network.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is None (N) since the attack can be done automatically without user involvement.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to gain higher privileges or access other systems. It's a DoS, which affects availability but doesn't change the scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is None (N) because the issue isn't about data exposure. The problem is about resource consumption leading to service disruption.\n\nIntegrity (I) is also None (N) since the attack doesn't modify data or systems. It's about making the service unavailable.\n\nAvailability (A) is High (H) because the DoS attack directly impacts the availability of the service, causing latency, timeouts, and read errors.\n\nPutting it all together, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Wait, but the user's example had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem states that the vulnerability leads to DoS, which affects availability. So A is High. But what about C and I? The description says the server processes long URLs, leading to high resource consumption, which is a DoS. So the attack doesn't compromise confidentiality or integrity. So C and I should be None. But maybe the user's example had different values. Let me recheck the metrics.\n\nThe user's example had C:H, I:H, A:H. But in this case, the DoS is about availability. So A is High. C and I are None.

A low-privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability to modify select data. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about Adobe Commerce versions being affected by an Incorrect Authorization vulnerability. The goal is to determine each base metric and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The metrics are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attacker is a low-privileged one, and exploitation doesn't require user interaction. The vulnerability is about incorrect authorization, which might mean the attacker can access something they shouldn't. But how is the attack vector? If the attacker can exploit it without user interaction, maybe it's local or network. Wait, the description mentions \"low-privileged attacker\" which suggests the attack is local, because if it's network, the attacker would need to be remote. But the exact wording says \"low-privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability to modify select data.\" So maybe the attack is local (AV:L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated as a low-privileged user. But wait, sometimes if the attack is through a network, but the attacker is already authenticated, maybe AV:N? Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The vulnerability is an incorrect authorization, which could allow bypassing security features. If the attacker is already authenticated (as a low-privileged user), then the attack vector is local (AV:L) because the attacker is within the system. But if the attacker can exploit it remotely without being authenticated, then AV:N. However, the description says \"low-privileged attacker\" which implies that the attacker has some level of access, so maybe it's local. But I need to check the exact wording again. The description says \"A low-privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability to modify select data.\" So the attacker is already in the system, so AV:L. But wait, sometimes even if the attacker is local, if they can exploit it remotely, it's AV:N. Wait, no. Attack Vector is about how the attack is delivered. If the attacker is on the same network, it's Network (N). If they need to be on the same system, it's Local (L). Since the attacker is low-privileged, maybe they are already on the system, so AV:L. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check other metrics to see if that helps.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says \"low-privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability to modify select data.\" The term \"low-privileged\" might relate to the privileges required. Wait, PR is Privileges Required. Let me check that. The PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already low-privileged, maybe PR is Low (L) because they don't need to escalate privileges. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already a low-privileged user, then maybe PR is Low (L) because they don't need to have higher privileges. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it with low privileges, then PR is Low. But the description says \"low-privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability\", which suggests that the attacker doesn't need to have higher privileges. So PR would be Low (L). But I need to be careful here. Let me think again. The PR metric is the level of privileges required for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already a low-privileged user, then they can exploit it without needing to elevate privileges. So PR is Low (L). But if the attacker needs to have some privileges, maybe it's High. Wait, the description says \"low-privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability\", which implies that the attacker doesn't need to have higher privileges. So PR is Low (L). \n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says \"Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.\" So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The description says the attacker can modify select data. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data, but the scope is unchanged, then S is Unchanged (U). Because the attack doesn't change the scope, it's still within the same component. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows modifying data, so confidentiality is not directly affected. So C is None (N). Wait, but the description says \"security feature bypass\" which might allow unauthorized access to data. Wait, the description says \"could result in a security feature bypass\" which might allow the attacker to bypass security features, which could lead to unauthorized access. But the specific impact here is that the attacker can modify select data. So confidentiality is not directly affected, but integrity is. So C is None (N), I is High (H), and A is None (N) unless there's availability impact. The description doesn't mention availability, so A is None (N). Wait, but the attacker can modify data, which affects integrity. So I is High (H). \n\nWait, let me recheck. The vulnerability allows a low-privileged attacker to modify select data. So the impact on integrity is High (H) because the attacker can change data. Confidentiality is not directly affected unless the data being modified is confidential. But the description doesn't specify that. So C is None (N). Availability is not mentioned, so A is None (N). \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) because the attacker is low-privileged, implying they are on the system. But wait, if the attack is through a network, but the attacker is already authenticated, then AV:N. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. Attack Vector is about how the attack is delivered. If the attacker is on the same network, it's Network (N). If they need to be on the same system, it's Local (L). The description says \"low-privileged attacker\" which suggests that the attacker is already authenticated, so they are on the system. Therefore, AV:L. \n\nBut another angle: if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing to be authenticated, then AV:N. But the description says \"low-privileged attacker\", which might mean that the attacker is already authenticated. So AV:L. \n\nSo AV:L, AC:L (since the attack is possible with low complexity?), PR:L (since the attacker has low privileges), UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:H, A:N. \n\nWait, but Attack Complexity (AC) is about the complexity of the attack. If the attacker can exploit it with low complexity, then AC:L. The description doesn't mention complexity, but since it's a vulnerability that can be exploited by a low-privileged attacker, maybe the complexity is low. So AC:L. \n\nSo the vector would be:\n\nAV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:H, A:N. \n\nBut wait, the user interaction is none, so UI:N. \n\nBut let me check again. The description says \"Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.\" So UI:N. \n\nSo the final vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure about AV. If the attack is local, then AV:L. But if the attacker can exploit it remotely, then AV:N. How to determine that? The description says \"low-privileged attacker\" which might imply that the attacker is already on the system, so AV:L. But if the attacker is remote and can exploit it without needing to be authenticated, then AV:N. However, the description doesn't specify whether the attack is remote or local. But the fact that it's a low-privileged attacker might mean that the attacker is already authenticated, so AV:L. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the attack is through a network, but the attacker is already authenticated. But in that case, the attack vector would be Network (N). \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Let me think of similar examples. For example, if a vulnerability allows a local user to exploit it, AV:L. If it's a remote attacker, AV:N. Since the description doesn't specify, but mentions \"low-privileged attacker\", which could be local. So AV:L. \n\nSo the final vector would be as above. \n\nBut wait, the user might have intended AV:N. Let me check the original description again. The description says \"A low-privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability to modify select data.\" The term \"low-privileged\" might mean that the attacker doesn't need to have higher privileges, but the attack vector could be local. However, if the attacker is remote and can exploit it without needing to be authenticated, then AV:N. But the description doesn't mention that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the attack is through a network, but the attacker is already authenticated. But in that case, the attack vector is Network (N). \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. The Attack Vector (AV) metric is defined as the method by which the vulnerability is exploited. If the attacker is on the same network, AV:N. If the attacker is local, AV:L. If the attacker needs physical access, AV:P. \n\nIn this case, the attacker is low-privileged, which might imply that they are already on the system (local), so AV:L. \n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with AV:L. \n\nSo the final vector is:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a SQL injection vulnerability in a WordPress plugin. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the'review_id' parameter, which is a user-supplied input. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated (Subscriber-level access), they can't just send a request from the network. So AV should be Local (L) because the attack requires the attacker to be authenticated and have access to the system, which is a local attack. Wait, but sometimes if the parameter is in a URL, maybe it's network? Hmm. Wait, the description says \"authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access\" can exploit it. So the attack vector is local because the attacker needs to be logged in. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping and lack of preparation. The attacker can append SQL queries, which might require some knowledge of the SQL syntax. But since the attack is possible with just the parameter, maybe the complexity is Low (L). Because the attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps, just inject the SQL. So AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be authenticated with Subscriber-level access. So PR is Low (L) because it's not requiring admin privileges, just a user with Subscriber access. So PR is Low.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The attacker can exploit it without needing the user to click a link or do anything. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows extracting sensitive information, which affects confidentiality. But does it change the scope? The scope is Changed (C) if the attack affects a different component. But in this case, the attack is on the same component (the database), so maybe Scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, the scope is about whether the attack affects a different component. Since the attacker is accessing the database, which is part of the same system, the scope is Unchanged. So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can extract sensitive information, so this is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The description doesn't mention modifying data, so Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability is about SQL injection, which could lead to data loss or denial of service, but the description doesn't specify that. Since the main issue is extracting data, maybe Availability is None (N). But wait, if the attacker can inject queries that delete data, that would be High. But the description says \"extract sensitive information\", so maybe Availability isn't affected. So A is N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Then the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Wait, but the example given in the problem had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nThe description says \"extract sensitive information from the database\" which is Confidentiality (C) High. But what about Integrity and Availability? If the attacker can inject queries that modify data, that would be Integrity. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think Integrity is None. Availability is also not mentioned. So the answer should have C:H, I:N, A:N. But maybe the original example had different values. Wait, the example given in the problem's final line is Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. But that's just an example. Let me make sure.\n\nIn the given CVE, the attacker can append additional SQL queries to extract data. So that's C:H. If the attacker can also modify data, then I would be High. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think I is N. Similarly, A is N unless there's a possibility of DoS. But the description doesn't mention that. So the correct values are C:H, I:N, A:N. So the vector is AV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user is authenticated, so PR is Low. Attack Vector is Local because the attacker needs to be authenticated. So AV:L. Attack Complexity is Low because the injection is straightforward. So the vector is correct.

When it creates a node in tipc_node_check_dest(), after inserting the new node into hashtable in tipc_node_create(), it creates the bc link. However, there is a gap between this insert and bc link creation, a bc packet may come in and get the node from the hashtable then try to dereference its bc link, which is NULL. This patch is to fix it by moving the bc link creation before inserting into the hashtable. Note that for a preliminary node becoming \"real\", the bc link creation should also be called before it's rehashed, as we don't create it for preliminary nodes.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to understand the CVE description. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the TIPC (Transparent Inter-Process Communication) module. The issue is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a race condition. The problem arises when a node is created, and the bc (broadcast) link is created after inserting the node into a hash table. This allows a bc packet to arrive before the link is created, leading to a NULL dereference.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so an attacker would need to have local access. But wait, the description mentions that the issue is a race condition. However, the NULL pointer dereference is due to a race between inserting the node into the hash table and creating the bc link. If the attacker can send a packet during that window, they might trigger the crash. But since the node is part of the kernel, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to be in the same system. However, if the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, it might be Network (N). But the description doesn't mention remote exploitation. The patch is about moving the bc link creation to prevent the race. So, the attack vector is probably Local (L) because the attacker needs to be on the same system to trigger the race condition.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity here is that the attacker has to time their packet to arrive during the gap between inserting the node and creating the bc link. This requires some coordination, so the attack complexity is High (H). But sometimes, if the exploit is straightforward, it might be Low. However, since the attacker needs to exploit a race condition, which is more complex, High seems right.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have local access to the system, so they need to be authenticated. But the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker might not need any privileges beyond being local. Wait, the patch is about a race condition in the kernel, so the attacker would need to be local. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have local access but not necessarily elevated privileges. Wait, but if the attacker is already in the system, maybe they don't need any specific privileges. So PR is None (N)? Wait, no. The CVSS PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated (i.e., have a user account), then it's Low. But if the attacker can exploit it without any authentication, it's None. Since this is a kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need to be local, which typically requires some level of access. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already in the system, maybe they don't need any additional privileges. So PR is None (N)? Or is it Low? Hmm. The CVSS PR metric is defined as: None (N) if no privileges are required, Low (L) if the attacker needs to have user-level privileges, and High (H) if they need administrative privileges. Since this is a kernel-level vulnerability, the attacker would need to be local, which is typically considered as having some privileges. But the exact definition might vary. However, in many cases, kernel vulnerabilities are considered to require local access, which is considered as Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already in the system (local), they might not need any additional privileges. So maybe PR is None (N). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. For example, if the vulnerability is in a user-space application, then PR would be None if the attacker can exploit it without any privileges. But for kernel vulnerabilities, the attacker needs to be local, which is considered as having some privileges. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already in the system, they might not need any additional privileges. So maybe PR is None (N). But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated (i.e., have a user account), then it's Low. If they can exploit it without any authentication, it's None. Since this is a kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need to be local, which is considered as having some privileges. But the exact definition might vary. However, in the absence of specific information, I think PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have local access, which is considered as requiring some privileges. Wait, but the CVSS PR metric's definition says: \"None (N) if no privileges are required, Low (L) if the attacker needs to have user-level privileges, and High (H) if they need administrative privileges.\" So if the attacker is local, they might have user-level privileges. So PR is Low (L). But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is PR: Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a race condition that can be triggered by sending a packet. The user interaction is not required. The attacker can send the packet without any user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on the system's availability (crash), the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't affect a different component. Wait, the scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new vulnerability in a different component. In this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on the kernel's functionality. So the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability causes a NULL pointer dereference, which could lead to a crash. However, the crash might not directly affect confidentiality. But if the crash leads to information leakage, then C would be High. However, the description doesn't mention any data leakage. So C is None (N). Wait, but the crash could be a denial of service, which affects availability. So confidentiality is not impacted. So C: None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a crash, which could be a denial of service. However, if the crash allows the attacker to modify data, then I would be High. But the description doesn't mention any modification of data. So I: None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability causes a crash, which is a denial of service. So A is High (H).\n\nWait, but the CVSS scoring for availability is High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a denial of service. So A: High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) because the attacker needs to be on the same system.\n\nAC: High (H) because the attack requires timing the packet to arrive during the race condition.\n\nPR: Low (L) because the attacker needs local access (user-level privileges).\n\nUI: None (N) because no user interaction is required.\n\nS: Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't affect a different component.\n\nC: None (N) because no confidentiality is impacted.\n\nI: None (N) because no integrity is impacted.\n\nA: High (H) because the crash is a denial of service.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the Attack Vector. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, could it be considered as Network (N)? For example, if the attacker can exploit it remotely, but the description doesn't mention that. The problem is a race condition in the kernel's TIPC module, which is used for inter-process communication. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be on the same system. So AV:L.\n\nBut I need to confirm. The CVSS Attack Vector metric defines AV as:\n\n- Network (N): Attack is via a network.\n- Adjacent (A): Attack is via a physically adjacent network.\n- Local (L): Attack is via local access.\n- Physical (P): Attack is via physical access.\n\nSince the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attacker would need to be local. So AV:L.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.7999999999999998, "success": true}

The user provided a CVE description about Cleartext storage in Ivanti products. The goal is to determine each base metric and then create the vector string.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the CVE description. The key points are that the vulnerability allows a local authenticated attacker with admin privileges to read sensitive data. The affected versions are before 22.7R2.6 and 22.7R1.3. \n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The attacker is local, so AV should be Local (L). Because the attacker needs to be on the same system, which is a local attack vector.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The description doesn't mention any complexity, so I assume it's Low (L). Typically, if there's no mention of complexity, it's considered low unless there's a specific requirement. But wait, maybe the attacker needs to have admin privileges. Wait, the PR is High (H) because the attacker needs admin privileges. But AC is about the complexity of the attack. Since the attacker is already authenticated and has admin rights, maybe the complexity is low. So AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs admin privileges, so PR is High (H). Because the attacker must have admin access to exploit this.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says \"local authenticated attacker\", so maybe no user interaction is needed. The attacker is already authenticated, so UI is None (N). Unless the attack requires some user action, but the description doesn't mention that. So UI is N.\n\nScope (S). The scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't change the scope. The attacker is exploiting the same component (the local system) and the impact is on the same component. So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The attacker can read sensitive data, which is a high confidentiality impact. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). The description doesn't mention any modification of data, so I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A). Similarly, there's no mention of denial of service or availability impact, so A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:H, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"local authenticated attacker with admin privileges\". So the attack vector is Local (L), attack complexity is Low (L), privileges required is High (H), user interaction is None (N), scope unchanged (U), confidentiality high (H), integrity and availability none. \n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. \n\nWait, but sometimes when there's a local attack, the attack vector is Local. Let me double-check each metric. \n\nYes, AV is Local. AC is Low because the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps, just has admin access. PR is High because the attacker needs admin privileges. UI is None because the attacker is already authenticated. Scope is Unchanged. C is High because sensitive data is read. I and A are None. \n\nSo the final vector should be as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

So we make sure the struct skb_shared_info is aligned to a cache line.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the bpf_prog_test_run_skb function. The issue arises when the size from a user BPF program is an odd number, leading to an unaligned access in struct skb_shared_info, causing a KFENCE use-after-free error on aarch64.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is triggered when a user-space BPF program provides an odd size. Since the BPF program runs in user space, but the issue occurs when the kernel processes this data, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the kernel module or the BPF program. However, wait, the BPF program is user-space, but the vulnerability is in the kernel. So the attacker would need to have a BPF program that can trigger this. But since BPF programs are executed in the kernel, maybe the attack vector is Local? Or is it Network? Hmm. Wait, the attack vector is how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can run a BPF program (which is user-space) that causes the kernel to process it, then the attack vector is Local because the attacker needs to have access to the system to run the BPF program. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity here is whether the attacker needs to perform any complex steps. The vulnerability is triggered by the size being an odd number. The attacker would need to set the size to an odd number, which is a simple action. So Attack Complexity is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have the ability to run a BPF program. Since BPF programs are typically run by users with certain privileges, but the vulnerability doesn't require elevated privileges beyond what's needed to run a BPF program. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can run a BPF program, which is a normal user privilege, then PR is None (N). Wait, but maybe the BPF program needs to be loaded into the kernel, which might require certain permissions. However, the PR metric in CVSS is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker doesn't need any special privileges beyond what's required to run the BPF program, then PR is None. But if the BPF program requires root access, then PR would be High. However, the description doesn't specify that. So I think PR is None (N) because the attacker can run a BPF program as a normal user, and the vulnerability is triggered by that.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered by the BPF program's size. The attacker doesn't need user interaction; the BPF program can be run automatically. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope refers to whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. In this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit leads to a use-after-free, which could potentially allow escalation of privileges. However, the scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and could lead to privilege escalation, the scope is Changed (C). Wait, but the original description says that the fix is to align the size. The scope is about whether the attack can affect resources beyond the initial component. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges (like root), then the scope is Changed. But the description doesn't explicitly mention privilege escalation. However, the use-after-free could be exploited for privilege escalation, so the scope is Changed (C).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability leads to a use-after-free, which could potentially allow information disclosure. However, the specific impact here is about the unaligned access causing a crash or data corruption. If the attacker can read data from the struct skb_shared_info, then confidentiality is High (H). But the description mentions a use-after-free, which might be more about integrity or availability. However, the exact impact isn't clear. Since the vulnerability is a use-after-free, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, which would affect confidentiality (exposing data), but the CVSS metrics are based on the potential impact. Since the vulnerability could allow the attacker to read data (if the struct contains sensitive info), then C is High (H). Alternatively, if the impact is more on integrity or availability, but the description doesn't specify. However, the use-after-free could be exploited to read or modify data, so I think C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability could allow the attacker to modify data structures, leading to integrity issues. Since the use-after-free could be exploited to overwrite data, leading to arbitrary code execution, which would affect integrity. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability could cause a crash (use-after-free), leading to denial of service. So A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Changed (C)\nC: High (H)\nI: High (H)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\nWait, but I need to check again. Let me verify each metric again.\n\nAttack Vector: The attacker needs to have a BPF program that can trigger the issue. Since BPF programs are user-space, but the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the system to run the BPF program. So AV is Local.\n\nAttack Complexity: The attacker just needs to set the size to an odd number, which is a simple action. So AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required: The attacker needs to run a BPF program, which is a normal user privilege. So PR is None.\n\nUser Interaction: No user interaction is needed. UI is None.\n\nScope: The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit could lead to privilege escalation (since use-after-free can be exploited for that), so the scope is Changed (C).\n\nConfidentiality: If the attacker can read data from the struct, then C is High. But the description doesn't specify, but the use-after-free could allow reading or writing, so C is High.\n\nIntegrity: The attacker could modify data structures, leading to integrity issues. So I is High.\n\nAvailability: The crash would affect availability. So A is High.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 1.5000000000000009, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a Stored XSS vulnerability in a WooCommerce plugin. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the plugin's shortcode, which is part of the WordPress site. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have contributor-level access, they can't exploit it from the network. So AV should be Local (L) because the attack requires being on the same network or having local access. Wait, but the description says \"authenticated attackers with contributor-level access\". So the attack vector is Local because the attacker has to be logged in and have access to the site. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability requires the attacker to have contributor access, but the input sanitization is insufficient. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any special steps beyond exploiting the input. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low privilege level. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says the script is injected and executed when a user accesses the page. So the user has to visit the injected page, which implies some user interaction. Wait, but the user might not need to interact if the script is automatically executed. Wait, the description says \"injected pages\" which are accessed by users. So the user interaction is required for the attack to be effective. Wait, but in XSS, sometimes the user interaction is required. For example, if the attacker injects a script into a page, and then the user visits that page, the script runs. So UI is Required (R) because the user has to click on the malicious link or visit the page. But wait, the CVSS definition for UI: \"None (N) if the attack can be performed without user interaction. Required (R) if the attack requires user interaction.\" In this case, the user has to access the injected page, which is part of the attack. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but maybe the user doesn't need to interact beyond visiting the page. Wait, the user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. So UI is Required (R). Hmm, but some sources say that if the attack is stored and the user just needs to view the page, then UI is None. Wait, no. Stored XSS is when the attacker injects a script into a page that is stored on the server. Then, when another user visits that page, the script is executed. So the initial injection requires user interaction (the attacker has to be authenticated and inject the script), but the actual exploitation requires the user to visit the page. So for the CVSS, the UI is Required (R) because the user has to interact with the page. Wait, but the attacker is the one who injects the script. The user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. So UI is Required (R). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. According to CVSS, UI is \"None (N) if the attack can be performed without user interaction. Required (R) if the attack requires user interaction.\" In this case, the attacker injects the script (which requires their own interaction), but the user has to access the page for the script to run. So the user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. Therefore, UI is Required (R). But maybe the user interaction is not required for the attack to be successful. Wait, the user interaction is part of the attack vector. For example, if the attacker injects the script into a page, and then the user visits that page, the script runs. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI is R. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The CVSS UI metric is about whether the attack requires the user to interact with the system. In this case, the user has to access the page, which is part of the attack. So UI is Required (R). So I'll go with UI: Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts, which can affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Since the scope is unchanged (the same component is affected), S is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability to gain higher privileges, then the scope would be Changed (C). However, in this case, the attacker is already authenticated with contributor-level access. The vulnerability allows them to inject scripts, which could affect other users. But the scope is about whether the attack affects a different component. Since the attack is on the same component (the plugin), the scope is Unchanged (U). So S: U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can inject scripts, which could steal user data. So confidentiality is High (H). Because the attacker can read sensitive information from the user's session or other data.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can modify the page content, so they can alter data. So integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The attacker could potentially cause denial of service, but the description doesn't mention that. So availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: Low (L)\nUI: Required (R)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: High (H)\nI: High (H)\nA: None (N)\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but I need to check again. Let me verify each metric again.\n\nAttack Vector: Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the site. So AV is Local.\n\nAttack Complexity: Low (L) because the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing to perform complex steps.\n\nPrivileges Required: Low (L) because contributor access is required, which is a low privilege level.\n\nUser Interaction: Required (R) because the user has to access the injected page for the script to execute.\n\nScope: Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't affect other components.\n\nConfidentiality: High (H) because the attacker can steal data.\n\nIntegrity: High (H) because the attacker can modify data.\n\nAvailability: None (N) because there's no mention of DoS.\n\nSo the vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nBut wait, some sources might say that for Stored XSS, UI is None. Let me check. For example, in the case of Stored XSS, the user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. So the user has to visit the page. Therefore, UI is Required (R). But according to some CVSS guidelines, if the attack requires the user to interact with the system, then UI is R. So I think the correct choice here is UI:R.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 1.1999999999999993, "success": true}

This depends on the values read from the llc_occupancy counters. The logic is applicable to architectures where the CLOSID effectively forms part of the monitoring identifier and so do not allow complete freedom to choose an unused monitoring identifier for a given CLOSID. This support missed that some platforms may not have these counters. This causes a NULL pointer dereference when creating a new control group as the array was not allocated by dom_data_init(). As this feature isn't necessary on platforms that don't have cache occupancy monitors, add this to the check that occurs when a new control group is allocated.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to understand the CVE description. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the resctrl module. The issue is that when creating a new control group, the code tries to find the cleanest CLOSID by checking llc_occupancy counters. However, some platforms don't have these counters, leading to a NULL pointer dereference because the array wasn't allocated. The fix adds a check to see if the platform has these counters before using them.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is a system-level component. The exploit would require local access, right? Because the code is part of the kernel, so an attacker would need to have local access to the system. So AV should be Local (L). Wait, but the description mentions that the issue occurs when creating a new control group. If the attacker is local, they can exploit this. But maybe the attack vector is Network? Wait, no. The vulnerability is in the kernel code, so the attack vector is Local. So AV is L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity here is whether the attacker needs to have certain privileges or not. The description says that the code is part of the kernel, so the attacker would need to have local access. The fix is to check if the platform has the counters. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps. The code is already in place, so the attack is straightforward. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have local access to the system. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attacker would need to be running with kernel privileges. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, maybe they don't need additional privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is local, they might already have some privileges. But the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. For example, if the vulnerability requires root access, then PR is High. But in this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to be local, but maybe the PR is None (N) because the attacker is already local. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is local, they might already have the necessary privileges. So PR is None (N)? Or is it High? Wait, the PR metric is defined as the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, they might not need any additional privileges. So PR is None (N). Wait, but maybe the attacker needs to have some privileges. Let me think again. The PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, then the attacker would need to have local access, which is already a privilege. So PR is None (N) because the attacker is already local. Or is it High? Wait, the PR metric options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to have some privileges, like root, then it's High. But in this case, the attacker is local, so they might already have the necessary privileges. So PR is None (N). Hmm, but maybe the PR is Low. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is local, they might not need any additional privileges. So PR is None (N). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS definitions. PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, then they don't need any additional privileges. So PR is None (N). So I'll go with PR: N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered when creating a new control group. The user interaction is not required. The attacker can exploit this without any user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The description says that the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the fix is to check if the platform has the counters. The vulnerability leads to a NULL pointer dereference, which is a crash. The scope here is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel) and doesn't allow the attacker to gain access to other components. So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability causes a NULL pointer dereference, which could lead to a crash. However, the description doesn't mention any data being leaked. So Confidentiality is None (N). Wait, but if the crash could lead to information disclosure, maybe it's Low. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which could lead to a crash. However, the description doesn't mention any modification of data. So Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability causes a NULL pointer dereference, which could lead to a crash. This would affect the availability of the system. So Availability is High (H). Because the crash would make the system unavailable.\n\nWait, but the CVSS scoring for Availability is High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause denial of service. So in this case, the crash would be a denial of service, so A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nWait, but I need to check again. Let me re-examine the metrics.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attack vector is Local (L). Correct.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps. The code is already in place, so the attack is straightforward. So AC is L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be local, but since the attacker is already local, PR is None (N). Correct.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): No user interaction is required. So UI is N.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (kernel), so scope is Unchanged (U). Correct.\n\nConfidentiality (C): No data is disclosed, so C is N.\n\nIntegrity (I): No data is modified, so I is N.\n\nAvailability (A): The crash leads to denial of service, so A is H.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.7000000000000002, "success": true}

This vulnerability allows attacker to manipulate SQL queries and access sensitive database information, such as table names and sensitive data. Version 3.4.6 fixes the issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a SQL injection vulnerability in WeGIA. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in a web endpoint, so the attacker would need to send a request through the network. That points to AV:N (Network). But wait, sometimes if it's a local exploit, but since it's a web app, it's network-based. So AV:N makes sense.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). SQL injection typically requires the attacker to craft specific input, which might be considered low complexity because it's a single input parameter. So AC:L (Low).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker doesn't need any prior access; they can exploit it from the network. So PR:N (None).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says the attacker can manipulate SQL queries to access data. If the user doesn't need to interact, like the attack is automated, then UI:N (None). But if the user has to click a link, maybe UI:R. But the CVE says it's a vulnerability in a parameter, so likely no user interaction needed. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability allows access to sensitive data, but does it change the scope? If the attack affects the same scope (like the same database), then S:U (Unchanged). If it allows access to other systems, then S:C. But the description mentions accessing database info, which is within the same scope. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The attacker can access sensitive data, so C:H (High).\n\nIntegrity (I). The description doesn't mention modifying data, just accessing it. So I:N (None).\n\nAvailability (A). No mention of denial of service, so A:N (None).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Wait, but the example in the question had I:H and A:H. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nThe vulnerability allows access to sensitive data (C:H), but does it affect integrity or availability? The description says \"access sensitive database information, such as table names and sensitive data.\" No mention of modifying data (so I:N) or causing a DoS (A:N). So the initial assessment is correct. But maybe the user interaction is required? Let me re-read the CVE. The endpoint is a PHP file, so the attack is via HTTP request. The user doesn't need to interact beyond the initial request. So UI:N. So the vector is as above. But maybe the scope is changed? If the attacker can access other parts of the system, but the description doesn't say that. So S:U. So the final answer should be the vector with those values.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 1.3000000000000007, "success": true}

The attack requires Bitdefender BOX to be booted in Recovery Mode and that the attacker be present within the WiFi range of the BOX unit.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is an improper access control in Bitdefender Box 1, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to downgrade the firmware to an older version. The attack requires the device to be booted into Recovery Mode and the attacker to be within the WiFi range.\n\nStarting with the base metrics. Let's go one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The attacker needs to be within the WiFi range. WiFi is a network-based attack vector. So AV should be Network (N). But wait, the attack requires the device to be in Recovery Mode. Does that change the vector? Hmm. Recovery Mode might be a local condition, but the attacker has to be on the same network. Wait, the attacker is within WiFi range, which is a network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The attack requires the device to be in Recovery Mode. But the attacker doesn't need any special tools or steps beyond being in range. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker is unauthenticated. So no privileges are needed. PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says the attacker needs to be present within WiFi range. But does that require user interaction? The attacker doesn't need to interact with the user; they just need to be in range. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows downgrading firmware, which affects the same component (the device's firmware). The scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope of the vulnerability. Wait, but if the attack affects different components, like changing the firmware, maybe the scope is Changed (C). Wait, the scope is about whether the attack affects a different component. If the vulnerability is in the firmware, and the attack is about downgrading, which is part of the same component, then S is Unchanged (U). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The scope is whether the attack impacts a different component. If the vulnerability is in the firmware, and the attack is about downgrading, which is part of the same component, then the scope remains the same. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can downgrade the firmware, which might allow them to access older versions. But the main issue here is that the attacker can change the firmware, which affects integrity. However, if the firmware is signed, maybe the attacker can't read the firmware's contents. But the description says the attacker can downgrade to an older version. So maybe confidentiality isn't directly affected. Wait, the vulnerability is improper access control, allowing the attacker to change the firmware. So confidentiality might not be a direct impact. But the attacker could potentially access data if the firmware is compromised. However, the description doesn't mention data exposure. So maybe C is None (N). Wait, but the attacker can change the firmware, which might allow them to access data. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the attacker can exploit this to gain access to the device's data. But the description doesn't specify that. So perhaps C is None (N). Wait, but the attack is about downgrading, which is more about integrity. So maybe C is None (N), I is High (H), and A is High (H) because the attacker can change the firmware (integrity) and potentially cause denial of service (availability). Wait, but the attacker can downgrade, which might not directly affect availability unless the older firmware has a bug. But the description doesn't mention that. So maybe A is None (N). Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me check the metrics again.\n\nConfidentiality (C): If the attacker can access the firmware, maybe they can read data. But the description says the attacker can downgrade the firmware. So maybe the confidentiality isn't directly affected. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can change the firmware, which is a high impact on integrity. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): If the attacker can downgrade the firmware, maybe the device becomes unstable or crashes, leading to availability issues. But the description doesn't specify that. However, the attack requires the device to be in Recovery Mode, which might be a specific state. So maybe A is None (N) unless the downgrade causes a denial of service. Since the description doesn't mention that, I'll assume A is None (N).\n\nWait, but the attack allows the attacker to downgrade to an older version. If the older version has a vulnerability, that could lead to other issues. But the CVSS metrics are based on the direct impact. So for the base score, the metrics are based on the immediate impact. So if the attacker can change the firmware, that's a high integrity impact. Availability might not be directly affected unless the downgrade causes the device to stop working. But the description doesn't mention that. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:N (None), UI:N (None), S:U (Unchanged), C:N (None), I:H (High), A:N (None).\n\nWait, but the user interaction is None because the attacker doesn't need to interact with the user. The attack requires the device to be in Recovery Mode, but that's a state the attacker can trigger. So UI is None.\n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N.\n\nBut wait, the initial analysis said that the attack allows downgrading firmware, which could affect availability if the older firmware has issues. But the description doesn't mention that. So maybe A is None. However, if the attacker can change the firmware, that could lead to denial of service. But without explicit mention, it's safer to assume A is None.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the attack requires the device to be in Recovery Mode, which might be a specific state. If the attacker can force the device into that mode, maybe that's a local attack. Wait, the attacker is within WiFi range, which is network. So AV is Network. But if the attacker has to be physically present to boot into Recovery Mode, that might be a local attack. Wait, the description says the attacker needs to be present within the WiFi range. So that's a network-based attack. So AV is Network.\n\nSo the final vector is as above. Let me check again.\n\nAnother point: the attack requires the device to be in Recovery Mode. How is that achieved? If the attacker can trigger that mode remotely, then it's network. If it's a local action, like physical access, then AV would be Local. But the description says the attacker is within WiFi range, which is network. So AV is Network.\n\nSo the final vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N.\n\nBut wait, the initial thought about confidentiality. If the attacker can downgrade the firmware, maybe they can access data stored in the device. But the description doesn't mention that. So C is None. So the answer would be as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "score": 1.7999999999999998, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the bpf_sk_select_reuseport() function, where there's a memory leak. The issue is that a TCP ESTABLISHED socket might have had SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPF set before it became established. The fix involves dropping the reference in error paths to prevent memory leaks.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is a system-level component. The memory leak could be exploited by a local attacker, as the issue is related to kernel code. However, the description doesn't mention if it's accessible over the network. Since it's a kernel vulnerability, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to have local access to the system. But wait, sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger them via network. However, the description doesn't specify that. So I'll assume AV is Local (L) because the problem is in the kernel's internal handling, which typically requires local access.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity here is about how hard it is for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability. The fix involves dropping references in error paths, which suggests that the exploit might require some specific conditions. However, the description doesn't mention any complexity in the attack. Since the memory leak is a straightforward issue, the attack complexity is likely Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps to exploit it.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have some level of privilege. However, the problem is about a memory leak, which might not require elevated privileges. But since it's a kernel vulnerability, the attacker might need to be local. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is local, they might already have privileges. But the description doesn't specify if the exploit requires any specific privileges beyond being local. So PR is likely None (N) because the attacker doesn't need additional privileges beyond what's required to access the system locally.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a memory leak, which is a resource issue. Memory leaks typically don't require user interaction because they can be triggered by the attacker's actions without needing the user to do anything. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope refers to whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the memory leak is within the kernel, and the fix is about dropping references, the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope of the vulnerability; it's still within the same component (kernel).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The memory leak could lead to data being lost or not properly managed, but the description doesn't mention any data exposure. So Confidentiality is None (N) because there's no disclosure of data.\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the issue is a memory leak, which affects availability more than integrity. However, if the memory leak leads to corruption or incorrect data handling, it might affect integrity. But the description doesn't mention that. So Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion, which affects availability. The memory leak could cause the system to run out of memory, leading to denial of service. Therefore, Availability is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together, the vector would be AV:L, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. Wait, but the user mentioned that the answer should be in the format with the exact string. Let me double-check each metric again.\n\nWait, for Attack Vector, if the vulnerability is in the kernel, but the exploit requires local access, then AV is Local (L). Attack Complexity is Low (L) because the exploit is straightforward. Privileges Required is None (N) because the attacker is local. User Interaction is None (N). Scope is Unchanged (U). Confidentiality and Integrity are None (N) because the issue is a memory leak, not data exposure or modification. Availability is High (H) because the memory leak can lead to denial of service. So the vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the example given in the problem has C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the CVE description.\n\nThe CVE is about a memory leak. Memory leaks can affect availability because they can lead to resource exhaustion. However, the description doesn't mention any specific impact on confidentiality or integrity. So C and I are None. But sometimes, if the memory leak is in a critical component, it might be considered as affecting availability. So A is High. So the final vector would be as above. But I need to make sure. Let me check the CVSS metrics again. For example, if the vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a denial of service, then A is High. So yes, A is High.

This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted NAS packet.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a buffer overflow in Magma's code. I need to figure out each of the base metrics.\n\nFirst, Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in a function that processes a NAS packet. Since the NAS packet is part of the network communication, the attack vector is likely Network (N). Attackers would send a malicious packet over the network to trigger the buffer overflow. So AV:N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The buffer overflow requires the attacker to craft a specific NAS packet. This seems like a low complexity because the attacker doesn't need special tools or knowledge beyond creating the packet. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior access. They can exploit this from the network without authentication.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is None (N) since the attack can be done automatically without user action. The DoS is triggered by the crafted packet alone.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't change the scope. The attack affects the same component (the system processing the NAS packet) and doesn't allow elevation of privilege.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is None (N) because the buffer overflow leads to DoS, not data disclosure. But wait, maybe there's a chance of data leakage? The description says DoS, so probably C:N.\n\nIntegrity (I) is None (N) as well. The DoS is about availability, not altering data. Unless the buffer overflow could modify data, but the description doesn't mention that. So I:N.\n\nAvailability (A) is High (H) because the DoS would make the service unavailable. The buffer overflow could crash the system, leading to a denial of service.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Wait, but the user's example had C:H, I:H, A:H. Did I miss something? Let me check again.\n\nThe description says the vulnerability allows attackers to cause a DoS via a crafted NAS packet. So the main impact is availability. But maybe the buffer overflow could also lead to arbitrary code execution, which would affect confidentiality and integrity. However, the CVE description doesn't mention that. It only mentions DoS. So I should stick to the given info. So C:N, I:N, A:H. But maybe the DoS is considered a high impact on availability. So A:H. The other metrics are as above.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a WordPress plugin vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via shortcodes, which are part of the WordPress content. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated (contributor-level or higher), they can't exploit it from a remote network. So AV should be Local (L) because the attack requires the attacker to be logged in. Wait, but the description says \"authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions\". So the attack vector is Local because the attacker has to be authenticated and access the site. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description mentions insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The attacker doesn't need to do anything complex; they just need to input malicious code into the shortcodes. So AC is Low (L) because the attack doesn't require complex steps.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs some level of access but not full privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since the attacker is already authenticated, PR is Low (L) because it's not requiring root or admin privileges, just contributor-level. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says the script executes when a user accesses the injected page. So the user has to visit the page, which implies some user interaction. But the question is whether the UI is required. If the attacker injects the script, and then the user has to click on it, then UI is Required (R). But if the script is automatically executed when the page is loaded, maybe UI is None (N). Wait, the description says \"inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the user has to access the page, which is part of the attack. So UI is Required (R) because the user has to interact with the page for the script to execute. Wait, but sometimes in XSS, the user interaction is required. For example, if the attacker injects the script, and the user has to click on a link or view the page. So UI is Required (R). But I need to check the exact definition. The UI metric is whether user interaction is required for the attack to succeed. If the attacker injects the script, and the user has to visit the page, then the user interaction is required. So UI is R. But maybe the attack is considered to have no user interaction because the script is executed automatically when the page is loaded. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The vulnerability is stored XSS, which typically requires the user to visit the page. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI is R. But some sources might say that for stored XSS, the user interaction is required. So I'll go with UI: Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new attack vector that affects a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the plugin, and the attack affects the same component (the user's page), the scope is Unchanged (U). So S: U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can inject scripts, which could potentially steal data. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can access sensitive information. Wait, but the description says \"inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the attacker can execute scripts, which could lead to stealing cookies, session tokens, etc. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can modify the page content, but the description says it's stored XSS. Wait, stored XSS allows the attacker to inject scripts that are stored on the server and executed when users visit the page. So the attacker can modify the page's content (integrity) by injecting scripts. So I is High (H) because the attacker can alter the page's content, which affects integrity.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't directly affect availability. The attacker can't cause denial of service here. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: Low (L)\nUI: Required (R)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: High (H)\nI: High (H)\nA: None (N)\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about UI. Let me check again. The user has to access the page, which is part of the attack. So the user interaction is required. So UI is R. But some might argue that the user interaction is not required because the script is executed automatically. However, in stored XSS, the user interaction is required because the user has to visit the page. So UI is R. But maybe the answer expects UI to be N. Wait, the CVSS definition for UI: \"User interaction is required for the attack to succeed.\" If the attacker injects the script, and the user has to access the page, then the user interaction is required. So UI is R. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS documentation. According to CVSS v3.1, UI is \"None (N) if the attack can be performed without any user interaction, or Required (R) if the attack requires the user to perform some action (e.g., clicking a link).\"\n\nIn this case, the attacker injects the script, and the user has to access the page. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI is R. So the vector would have UI:R.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me think again. If the attacker injects the script into a page, and then the user visits that page, the script is executed. So the user has to interact with the page. Therefore, UI is Required (R). So the answer would have UI:R.\n\nSo the final vector is:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but the user might have a different take. Let me check the original description again. The description says \"authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the user has to access the page, which is part of the attack. Therefore, UI is Required (R). So the answer should have UI:R.\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: if the attacker can inject the script, and the user doesn't need to do anything else, but the script is executed when the user accesses the page. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI is R.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 1.1999999999999993, "success": true}

The user provided a CVE description, and I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string. Let me start by recalling the CVSS v3.1 base metrics and their definitions.\n\nFirst, the CVE says there's a pre-authentication deserialization vulnerability in the SMA1000 Appliance Management Console and Central Management Console. The vulnerability allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands under specific conditions. \n\nLet me go through each metric one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The description mentions a remote attacker. Since the attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, and the attack is remote, AV should be Network (N). Because the attacker can exploit this from the network without needing to be on the same network or physically present.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a deserialization issue. Typically, deserialization vulnerabilities can be exploited with low complexity if the attacker can send a crafted payload. Since the attacker doesn't need to have any prior authentication, and the attack is possible with a single request, AC is likely Low (L). But I need to check if there's any complexity involved. If the attacker needs to craft a specific payload, maybe that's low complexity. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker is unauthenticated, so PR is None (N). The attacker doesn't need any privileges to exploit this.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says \"pre-authentication\" and the attacker can execute commands remotely. It doesn't mention any user interaction required, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope refers to whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the attack allows executing OS commands, which could affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system, the scope is Changed (C). Wait, but the original description says \"pre-authentication\" and the attack is on the management consoles. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to execute commands, that's a change in scope because it's affecting the system's resources beyond the initial component. So S:C.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can execute OS commands, which could lead to accessing sensitive data. So confidentiality is High (H). Because the attacker could read files, access data, etc.\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, executing OS commands could allow modifying system files or configurations, so integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The attacker could potentially cause denial of service by executing commands that crash the system or consume resources. So availability is High (H).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the scope. If the vulnerability is in the management console, and the attacker can execute OS commands, that's a change in scope because the attacker can affect the system's resources beyond the initial component. So S:C. But sometimes, if the attack is within the same component, maybe it's unchanged. Hmm. Let me think again. The management console is part of the system, so if the attacker can execute OS commands, that's affecting the system's availability, confidentiality, and integrity. So the scope is changed because the attack affects the system's resources beyond the initial component. Therefore, S:C.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (remote), AC:L (low complexity), PR:N (no privileges), UI:N (no user interaction), S:C (scope changed), C:H, I:H, A:H.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the scope is correct. Let me check the CVSS definition for scope. Scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to create, modify, or delete resources that are not part of the original component. In this case, the management console is part of the system, so if the attacker can execute OS commands, they can affect the system's resources, which is a different component. Therefore, the scope is changed. So S:C is correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: the attack is pre-authentication, so the attacker doesn't need to be authenticated. So PR:N. The user interaction is none, so UI:N. The attack vector is network because it's remote. Attack complexity is low because the attacker can send a crafted payload without needing to have any prior access. So the metrics seem correct.\n\nSo the final vector string should be as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.1999999999999993, "success": true}

This may result into secret data or pointers revealing the layout of the address space to be included into a deserialized data structure, which may potentially lead to thread crashes or cause denial of service conditions.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description, and I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let me start by recalling the CVSS v3.1 base metrics and their definitions.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the vulnerability is due to an integer underflow during deserialization. The attacker can exploit this without authentication. Since the deserialization is happening over a network (like a network service), the attack vector is likely Network (N). But wait, if the deserialization is part of a local application, maybe it's Local (L). But the description mentions \"any unauthenticated user,\" which suggests that the attack can be done remotely. So AV:N makes sense here.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The integer underflow requires the attacker to craft a specific input. If the attacker needs to create a specific payload, that's High complexity. But sometimes, if the exploit is straightforward, it might be Low. However, since it's a deserialization issue, which often requires precise input, I think AC:H is correct.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior access. The user is unauthenticated, so PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is None (N) because the attack can be done without any user interaction. The user just needs to send the malicious data.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't change the scope. The attack affects the same component or system, so S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is High (H) because the issue allows reading out of bounds memory, which could expose secrets or pointers. That's a confidentiality issue.\n\nIntegrity (I) is High (H) because the attacker could modify data structures, leading to thread crashes or denial of service. Wait, the description mentions thread crashes and denial of service, which are availability issues. But the initial part about reading out of bounds memory affects confidentiality. However, the integrity might be High if the attacker can alter data. But the description says \"read out of bounds heap memory\" which is more about confidentiality. Hmm, maybe I need to check again. The problem states that the attacker can read secret data or pointers, which is confidentiality. But the denial of service (DoS) is availability. So for Integrity, maybe it's None? Wait, the description says \"may result into secret data or pointers revealing the layout of the address space to be included into a deserialized data structure, which may potentially lead to thread crashes or cause denial of service conditions.\" So the thread crashes and DoS are availability issues. So for Integrity, maybe it's None? Or is there a possibility of modifying data? The original issue is about reading, not modifying. So I think Integrity is None (N). Wait, but the problem says \"may potentially lead to thread crashes or cause denial of service conditions.\" Thread crashes and DoS are availability (A). So for Integrity, maybe it's None. But the initial part about reading out of bounds memory is confidentiality. So C:H, I:N, A:H?\n\nWait, the user needs to determine each metric. Let me re-express:\n\nConfidentiality (C): High (H) because the attacker can read secret data or pointers. That's a confidentiality issue.\n\nIntegrity (I): None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't allow modification of data, just reading. Unless the deserialization could be manipulated to alter data structures, but the description doesn't mention that. It's about reading out of bounds, which is confidentiality.\n\nAvailability (A): High (H) because the denial of service (thread crashes, DoS) is an availability issue.\n\nSo the metrics would be:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:H (High complexity), PR:N (None), UI:N (None), S:U (Unchanged), C:H (High), I:N (None), A:H (High).\n\nWait, but the user's example answer has I:H. Let me check again. The original description says \"may result into secret data or pointers revealing the layout of the address space to be included into a deserialized data structure, which may potentially lead to thread crashes or cause denial of service conditions.\" So the first part is confidentiality (C:H), the second part is availability (A:H). Integrity (I) is not mentioned as being affected. So I:N.\n\nBut maybe the thread crashes could be considered as integrity? No, thread crashes are more about availability. So I think I:N is correct.\n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but the example given in the problem's final line example has I:H. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem says \"read out of bounds heap memory. This may result into secret data or pointers revealing the layout of the address space to be included into a deserialized data structure, which may potentially lead to thread crashes or cause denial of service conditions.\"\n\nSo the first part is confidentiality (C:H), the second part is availability (A:H). Integrity (I) is not directly mentioned. Unless the attacker can modify the data structure, but the description says \"read out of bounds\" which is reading, not modifying. So I:N.\n\nBut maybe the thread crashes are due to the attacker modifying the data structure, leading to integrity issues. Wait, if the attacker can read out of bounds, maybe they can overwrite data, leading to integrity issues. But the description doesn't mention that. It's about reading, not writing. So I think I:N is correct.\n\nSo the final vector would be AV:N, AC:H, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:H.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me check the CVSS metrics again. For example, if the vulnerability allows reading data, that's C:H. If it allows modifying data, that's I:H. If it causes DoS, that's A:H. So in this case, the answer would have C:H, A:H, and I:N.\n\nSo the vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the attack complexity is High. Let me think again. Attack Complexity (AC) is Low if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without requiring special conditions. High if the attacker needs to have some specific conditions. For deserialization issues, the attacker needs to craft a specific input, which is a high complexity. So AC:H is correct.\n\nSo the final answer should be as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.6999999999999993, "success": true}

The user provided a CVE description about a NULL dereference in the Linux kernel's pinctrl driver. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the kernel, so if an attacker can exploit it remotely, it would be Network (N). But wait, the issue is a NULL dereference in a function that's part of the kernel's pinmux handling. If the vulnerability is triggered by local access, like through a local user or process, then AV would be Local (L). But the description doesn't specify if it's local or remote. However, kernel vulnerabilities are often local unless there's a way to exploit them remotely. Since the fix is about a NULL pointer in a function that's part of the driver, maybe it's local. But I need to think carefully. If the attacker needs to be local to exploit this, then AV is Local. But if the vulnerability can be triggered via a network attack, then it's Network. The description doesn't mention any network component, so I think AV is Local (L). Wait, but sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger them via user input. However, without more info, I'll assume it's Local. So AV: L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires the attacker to have a specific condition, like the pdesc being null. The fix adds a null check. So the complexity is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to perform multiple steps. The null check is a simple check, so AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to have some privileges to trigger this. Since it's a kernel vulnerability, maybe the attacker needs to be a local user with some privileges. But the description doesn't specify. If the vulnerability can be exploited by a local user without needing elevated privileges, then PR is None (N). But if the attacker needs to be root or have some privileges, then it's High. However, the fix is about a NULL dereference, which might be exploitable by a local user. So PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges beyond being local.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is a NULL dereference, which can be triggered without user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't change the scope. The attack affects the same component (the kernel module) and doesn't allow elevation of privilege. So S: U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability leads to a NULL pointer access, which could potentially allow reading memory or causing a crash. But the description doesn't mention data disclosure. So C is None (N) unless the crash leads to information leakage. But the CVE is about a NULL dereference, which is more about a crash. So C: N.\n\nIntegrity (I). If the NULL dereference allows modifying data, then I would be High. But the description doesn't mention that. It's a crash, so maybe I is None. However, sometimes a NULL pointer dereference can be exploited to cause arbitrary code execution, which would affect integrity. But the fix is just adding a null check, so maybe it's a crash without data modification. So I: N.\n\nAvailability (A). The NULL dereference could lead to a crash, which affects availability. So A is High (H). Because the crash would make the system unavailable.\n\nWait, but the user might have to be local. Let me check again. If the attacker is local, then the availability impact is High. So A: H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the user's example had C:H, I:H, A:H. But in this case, the vulnerability is a NULL dereference leading to a crash. So maybe the impact is High on Availability.

A known situation is the failure of a websocket handshake will trigger a local reply leading to the crash of Envoy. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.33.1, 1.32.4, 1.31.6, and 1.30.10.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in Envoy's ext_proc HTTP filter, which can crash if a local reply is sent to an external server due to a lifetime issue. The crash happens when a websocket handshake fails, leading to a local reply that causes the crash. The fix is in specific versions.\n\nNow, the base metrics for CVSS v3.1 are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is triggered by a local reply sent to an external server. Wait, the description says \"if a local reply is sent to the external server\". So the attack vector here is local? Or is it network? Hmm. Wait, the attack is initiated by the local system, but the reply is sent to an external server. Wait, maybe the attacker is local to the system where Envoy is running. Because the crash is due to a local reply. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be on the same system as Envoy. But wait, the description mentions that the crash is triggered by a local reply. So the attacker would have to be local to the system where Envoy is running. So AV is Local (L). But wait, maybe the attack is through a network? Let me think again. The problem is that the filter's lifetime issue causes a crash when a local reply is sent. So the attacker would have to be able to trigger that local reply. If the attacker is on the same system, then AV is Local. But if the attacker is remote, maybe through a network, but the description says \"local reply\" which implies that the reply is generated locally. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity here is whether the attack requires multiple steps or not. The description says that the failure of a websocket handshake triggers the local reply. So the attack is straightforward once the handshake fails. So the complexity is Low (L) because it doesn't require much effort beyond the handshake failure.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any special privileges. The vulnerability is triggered by a local reply, which suggests that the attacker has local access. But the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. Since the attacker is local, maybe they need to have some privileges. Wait, but the description doesn't mention any specific privileges. If the attacker is local, they might already have access, so PR is None (N)? Wait, no. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is local, they might not need any additional privileges beyond being able to interact with the system. So PR is None (N). Wait, but maybe the attacker needs to have some privileges to trigger the local reply. But the description doesn't specify that. So I think PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says that the failure of a websocket handshake triggers the crash. So the attacker would need to cause the handshake to fail. If the attacker can do this without user interaction, then UI is None (N). But if the user has to interact, like clicking a link, then UI is Required (R). The description doesn't mention any user interaction, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The crash is in Envoy itself, so the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't affect a different component. Wait, but if the crash leads to a denial of service, that's an availability issue. But the scope is about whether the attack affects a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the same component (Envoy), the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability causes a crash, which might lead to data loss or exposure. But the description doesn't mention any data being leaked. So Confidentiality is None (N). Wait, but if the crash leads to a denial of service, that's an availability issue. But the question is about confidentiality. Since there's no mention of data being accessed or leaked, C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the crash doesn't affect the integrity of the system. The data isn't modified, so Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The crash leads to the service stopping, which is a denial of service. So Availability is High (H) because the service becomes unavailable.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The crash is due to a local reply. So the attacker can cause the service to crash, leading to denial of service. So A is High (H). \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the Attack Vector. Let me re-examine. The attack is triggered by a local reply. So the attacker is local. So AV is Local (L). But if the attack is through a network, then AV would be Network (N). Wait, the description says that the local reply is sent to the external server. So the attacker is on the same system as Envoy, and the reply is sent to an external server. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is local to the system where Envoy is running. So AV is Local (L). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.2999999999999998, "success": true}

The logic in commit 4f408e1fa6e1 (\"ibmvnic: retry reset if there are no other resets\") introduces an issue that results in a 32 byte memory leak whenever the last rwi in the list gets processed.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a memory leak in the Linux kernel's ibmvnic driver. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is a system-level component. The memory leak occurs when processing the last rwi in the list. Since the issue is related to kernel code, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to have local access to the system. But wait, could it be Network (N)? No, because the memory leak isn't exposed over the network. It's a kernel-level issue, so the attacker has to be local. So AV is Local (L).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is a memory leak. The fix was introduced in a commit, and the issue is that the code doesn't free the rwi structure when the last one is processed. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps. They just need to trigger the reset process, which might be straightforward. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to have local access to the system, but the vulnerability is in the kernel. If the attacker is already local, they might not need elevated privileges. However, the kernel is a core component, so maybe the attacker needs to have some level of access. Wait, the memory leak is a resource issue, not a privilege escalation. So PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges beyond local access. Wait, but the kernel is running with high privileges. If the attacker is local, they can already access the kernel. So PR is None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't require additional privileges beyond what's already needed for local access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The memory leak occurs automatically when the reset process is triggered. The user doesn't need to interact with the system for this to happen. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The scope refers to whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the memory leak is within the same component (the kernel's ibmvnic driver), the scope is Unchanged (U). The vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to gain access to a different component or escalate privileges beyond what's already possible. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C). The memory leak doesn't expose any confidential data. It's just a memory leak, so confidentiality is not affected. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I). Similarly, the memory leak doesn't modify any data. The integrity of the system isn't compromised. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A). The memory leak could lead to a denial of service if the memory is exhausted. However, the description mentions a 32-byte leak, which is a small amount. But in CVSS, even a small leak could be considered as High (H) if it's a resource exhaustion. Wait, the CVSS v3.1 defines Availability as High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to deny service. However, the description says \"memory leak whenever the last rwi in the list gets processed.\" A memory leak could lead to resource exhaustion over time, which would affect availability. But the question is whether the impact is High. Since the leak is 32 bytes, maybe it's considered Low. But in CVSS, even a small leak might be considered as Low. However, the user might need to consider if the leak can be exploited to cause a denial of service. If the leak is not exploitable for DoS, then A is None. But the description doesn't mention that. The problem is that the memory leak is a resource issue, which could affect availability. So maybe A is Low (L) or High (H). But the CVSS guidelines for Availability: High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause denial of service. Since the leak is a memory leak, which could lead to DoS, but the impact is not certain. However, the CVSS scoring for Availability is based on the potential impact. If the vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service, then A is High. But the description doesn't specify that the leak leads to DoS. It's just a memory leak. So maybe A is None (N). Wait, but the CVSS v3.1 defines the base metrics. For Availability, the impact is High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause the system to crash or become unavailable. Since the memory leak is a resource issue, but the description doesn't mention that it leads to a crash. So maybe A is None (N). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. According to the CVSS v3.1, the Availability metric is High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause the system to crash or become unavailable. If the memory leak is not sufficient to cause a crash, then A is None. However, the problem is that the memory leak could be exploited to cause a denial of service over time. But the description doesn't specify that. So perhaps the answer is that A is None (N). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Low (L) because the leak is a resource issue, but not a high impact. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The CVSS v3.1 defines the impact metrics. For Availability, High means the attacker can cause the system to crash or become unavailable. If the memory leak is not sufficient to cause that, then it's Low or None. Since the description says \"memory leak\", which is a resource issue, but not necessarily leading to a crash. So maybe A is None (N). But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Low (L) because the leak could be considered as a resource exhaustion, which is a low impact. But I'm not sure. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example answer has A:H. Wait, the example given in the problem's final line is Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. But that's just an example. The actual answer depends on the specific vulnerability. In this case, the memory leak is a resource issue. If the leak is not exploitable for DoS, then A is None. But if the leak can be exploited to cause DoS, then A is High. The description says \"memory leak whenever the last rwi in the list gets processed.\" So the leak is a small amount (32 bytes), which might not be enough to cause a DoS. Therefore, the impact on availability is None. So A is None (N). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Low (L) because the leak could be considered as a resource exhaustion, which is a low impact. But I think the correct approach here is to consider that the memory leak is a resource issue, which could affect availability. However, since the leak is small, the impact is low. So A is Low (L). But I'm not certain. Let me check the CVSS guidelines again. The CVSS v3.1 defines the impact metrics. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause the system to crash or become unavailable, then A is High. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a denial of service, but not a crash, then it's High. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a denial of service but not a crash, then it's High. However, if the vulnerability is a memory leak that doesn't lead to a crash, then the impact on availability is Low. But the problem is that the description doesn't specify whether the leak leads to a DoS. So perhaps the answer is that A is None (N). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Low (L) because the leak is a resource issue. But I think the correct approach here is to assume that the memory leak could be considered as a low impact on availability. So A is Low (L). But I'm not certain. Let me proceed with that. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: Low (L)\n\nWait, but the example in the problem's final line has A:H. But that's just an example. The actual answer depends on the specific vulnerability. In this case, the memory leak is a resource issue. If the leak is not exploitable for DoS, then A is None. But if the leak can be exploited to cause a DoS, then A is High. The description says \"memory leak whenever the last rwi in the list gets processed.\" So the leak is a small amount (32 bytes), which might not be enough to cause a DoS. Therefore, the impact on availability is None. So A is None (N). \n\nBut I'm still not sure. Let me think again. The CVSS v3.1 defines the base metrics. For Availability, the impact is High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause the system to crash or become unavailable. If the memory leak is not sufficient to cause that, then A is None. However, if the leak is a resource issue that could lead to a denial of service over time, then it's considered as High. But the description doesn't mention that. So perhaps the answer is that A is None (N). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Low (L) because the leak is a resource issue, which is a low impact.

The RCE allows attackers to access sensitive data, so C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can modify data or system files, so I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A).

This vulnerability affects Firefox < 135, Firefox ESR < 115.20, Firefox ESR < 128.7, Thunderbird < 128.7, and Thunderbird < 135.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring problem. The user provided a CVE description about a race condition during delazification leading to a use-after-free in Firefox and Thunderbird. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, I'll recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The base metrics are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a race condition during concurrent delazification. A race condition typically involves multiple threads or processes accessing shared resources, which could be exploited locally or remotely. But since the description mentions \"concurrent delazification,\" which is a process that might be happening within the same application, maybe it's a local attack. However, if the race condition can be triggered remotely, then AV would be Network (N). But the description doesn't specify if the attack is remote or local. Wait, the vulnerability is in Firefox and Thunderbird, which are web browsers. A race condition in a browser's internal process might be exploitable via a local attack, but if an attacker can trigger it through a web page, that would be network. Hmm. But the description says \"concurrent delazification\" which is a process that might be part of the browser's rendering or memory management. Since the attacker would need to have some local access to trigger the race condition (like through a malicious website that the user visits), maybe AV is Network (N) because the attack can be initiated remotely via a web page. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the race condition requires local access, like a local user with access to the system, then AV would be Local (L). But given that browsers are often attacked via web pages, I think AV is Network (N). Let me note that as AV:N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is a race condition, which usually requires some specific timing or conditions. For example, the attacker needs to trigger the race condition at the right time. This might be considered high complexity because it's not straightforward. However, if the race condition can be triggered with minimal effort, maybe it's low. But since it's a race condition, the complexity is often considered high because the attacker has to coordinate events precisely. So AC:H.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability is a use-after-free, which typically requires the attacker to have some level of access. However, in many cases, such vulnerabilities can be exploited without any prior privileges. For example, a local user could exploit it if they can trigger the race condition. But if the attacker needs to have some privileges, like being a local user, then PR would be Low (L). Since the description doesn't mention any specific privileges needed beyond the user being able to trigger the exploit (like visiting a malicious site), PR is likely Low (L). Wait, but if the attacker is a local user, then PR is Low. If it's a remote attacker, then PR is None. But since the attack is via a web page, the attacker doesn't need to have any privileges beyond the user's account. So PR:N. Wait, but the user might be a local user, so maybe PR is Low. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Let me think again. Use-after-free vulnerabilities in software can often be exploited by a local user, but if the exploit is triggered via a web page, the attacker doesn't need to have any specific privileges beyond the user's account. So PR is None (N) because no additional privileges are required beyond the user's existing access. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is a race condition during delazification. If the user needs to interact with the application (like clicking a link or visiting a malicious site), then UI is Required (R). But if the attack can be triggered automatically without user interaction, then UI is None (N). Since the description doesn't mention any user interaction required, but the attack is via a web page, which would require the user to visit the site. However, in some cases, the exploit might be triggered automatically when the page is loaded. So maybe UI is None (N) because the user doesn't need to interact beyond visiting the site. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the user has to perform some action, like clicking a button, then UI is R. But the description doesn't specify. Since the vulnerability is a race condition, it's possible that the attack can be triggered without further user interaction once the malicious content is loaded. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S). The scope refers to whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component or privilege level. Since this is a use-after-free in the application itself, the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't elevate privileges. The attacker can't gain access to other components or systems beyond what's already possible. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). A use-after-free can lead to arbitrary code execution, which would allow the attacker to read sensitive data. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). Similarly, if the attacker can exploit the use-after-free, they might be able to modify data, leading to High (H) integrity impact.\n\nAvailability (A). The use-after-free could lead to crashes or denial of service, so A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:H (High complexity), PR:N (None), UI:N (None), S:U (Unchanged), C:H, I:H, A:H.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n\nWait, but I need to double-check the Attack Complexity. For a race condition, is the complexity high or low? The CVSS guidelines state that if the attack requires the attacker to have some specific conditions or timing, it's high. Since a race condition requires precise timing, the complexity is high. So AC:H is correct.\n\nPR:N because no additional privileges are needed beyond the user's existing access. UI:N because the user doesn't need to interact beyond visiting the site. Scope is unchanged because the attack doesn't elevate privileges. So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.5999999999999996, "success": true}

The user provided a CVE description about a Stored XSS vulnerability in the ElementsKit plugin. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the URL attribute of a custom widget. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have Contributor-level access, that suggests the attack is happening through the local network or the application itself. Wait, but the description says \"authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access\". So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be logged in and have access to the system. But wait, sometimes if the attack is via a widget that's part of the site, maybe it's considered Local. Alternatively, if the attacker can inject the script into a page that others access, maybe it's Network? Hmm. Wait, the vulnerability is stored, so the attacker can inject the script into a page that others view. But the attacker needs to be authenticated to do that. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker has to be logged in to the site. So AV:L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The description says \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping\". The attacker doesn't need to do anything complex; they just inject the script. So Attack Complexity is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to be authenticated with Contributor-level access. So PR is Low (L) because it's not requiring admin privileges, just Contributor. Wait, but the question says \"authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above\". So the privileges required are Low (L) because Contributor is a lower privilege level than admin. So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says the script executes when a user accesses the injected page. So the user has to visit the page, which implies that User Interaction is Required (R). Wait, but sometimes if the script is stored and executed automatically, maybe UI is None. Wait, the user has to access the page, so the attacker doesn't need to interact with the user. Wait, the user is the one accessing the page. So the attacker injects the script, and when the user visits the page, the script runs. So the user interaction is not required by the attacker, but the user has to access the page. But according to CVSS, UI is whether the user interaction is required for the exploit to succeed. In this case, the attacker injects the script, and the user's access is what triggers the exploit. So the user interaction is not required by the attacker. Wait, but the user has to be the one accessing the page. So the attacker doesn't need to interact with the user, but the user's action (visiting the page) is necessary. However, in CVSS, UI is whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack is triggered by the user visiting the page, then the user interaction is required. Wait, no. The user interaction is required if the attacker needs the user to take some action, like clicking a link. In this case, the user just needs to view the page. So maybe UI is None (N) because the attacker can inject the script, and the user's access is automatic. Wait, but the user has to access the page. So the user interaction is required. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check. For example, if the attack is a stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact with the attacker, but the user's action (visiting the page) is required. However, in CVSS, UI is whether the attack requires user interaction. If the user has to click a link or take some action, then UI is R. But if the user just views the page, then maybe UI is N. Wait, the CVSS definition says: \"User interaction is required for the attack to succeed.\" So if the user has to click a link or take some action, then UI is R. But in this case, the user just needs to access the page, which is part of normal usage. So maybe UI is N. Wait, but the attacker has to inject the script into the page, which is done by the attacker. The user's access is what triggers the exploit. So the user interaction is not required by the attacker. Therefore, UI is N. Wait, but the user is the one who is accessing the page. So the user's action is required. But the attacker doesn't need to interact with the user. So maybe UI is N. I think in this case, the user interaction is not required. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts, which can affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Since the scope is unchanged, the attack can only affect the same security scope. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The attacker can inject scripts, which can steal data. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can modify the page content, so I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A). The attacker could potentially cause denial of service, but the description doesn't mention that. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Then the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but the user interaction was a point of confusion. Let me double-check. The user has to access the page, but the attacker doesn't need to interact with the user. So UI:N. Yes, that's correct.

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of U3D files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25557.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a PDF-XChange Editor vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose information. Since the attacker can exploit this remotely, AV should be Network (N). But wait, the user interaction is required. Wait, the user has to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. So the attack vector is through the network, but the user has to interact. Hmm, but AV is about how the attack is delivered. If the attacker can send a malicious file via the network (like a U3D file), then AV is Network. But maybe the user has to open the file, which is a local action. Wait, the user interaction is required, but the attack vector is network because the attacker can send the malicious file over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The flaw is due to lack of proper validation, which might be a low complexity. Since the attacker doesn't need to have any special privileges or complex steps, AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The description says the attacker can leverage this with other vulnerabilities to execute code. But for the base metric, PR is about the privileges needed to exploit. Since the vulnerability is in the parsing of U3D files, which is part of the application, maybe the attacker doesn't need any privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. So UI is Required (R). Wait, the description says \"User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability\". So UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows disclosure of information. The scope is whether the attack affects a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the parsing of U3D files, which is part of the same application, the scope is Unchanged (U). Unless the attack can affect other components, but the description doesn't mention that. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The issue results in information disclosure. So C is High (H) because sensitive data is exposed.\n\nIntegrity (I): The description mentions that the attacker can leverage this with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code. But the base metric for I is about whether the vulnerability allows modification. Since the initial flaw is an out-of-bounds read, which is about disclosure, not modification. So I is None (N) unless the vulnerability can be used to modify data. But the description doesn't mention that. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which might not directly affect availability. But the note says that the attacker can use it with other vulnerabilities to execute code. However, the base metric for A is about whether the attack affects availability. Since the initial issue is disclosure, not denial of service, A is None (N).\n\nWait, but the description says \"execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process\". That might imply that the vulnerability could be used to affect availability if the code execution leads to crashes or other issues. But the base metric for A is about the impact on availability. However, the initial vulnerability is an information disclosure, not directly affecting availability. So maybe A is None (N). But the note says that the attacker can leverage this with other vulnerabilities. However, the base metric is about the direct impact. So I think A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:N (None), UI:R (Required), S:U (Unchanged), C:H (High), I:N (None), A:N (None). \n\nWait, but the user interaction is required, so UI is R.

The user provided a CVE description about a Reflected XSS vulnerability in the Newsletters plugin for WordPress. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, let's recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The ones mentioned are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a Reflected XSS, which typically requires the attacker to trick the user into clicking a malicious link. Since the user has to be tricked, the attack vector is likely Network (N) because the attacker can send a malicious link via email or other network means. Wait, but sometimes Reflected XSS can be considered as Local (L) if it's through a local context. But in this case, the description says unauthenticated attackers can inject scripts if they trick an admin into clicking a link. So the attack vector is Network because the attacker can send the malicious link over the network. So AV:N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). Reflected XSS usually requires the attacker to craft a link and get the user to click it. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need any special tools or steps beyond creating the link. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability is in the \"to\" parameter, and the attacker doesn't need any prior access. The user is unauthenticated, so PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The attack requires the user to click a link, which is a user interaction. So UI:R. Wait, but the description says \"unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick an admin user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\" So the user has to click the link, which is user interaction. Therefore, UI:R.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the plugin, and the attack is on the admin user, but the scope here is unchanged because the attack doesn't elevate privileges. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The attack allows injecting scripts, which could steal data. So confidentiality is high (H) because the attacker can read sensitive information.\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can inject scripts, which could modify data. So integrity is high (H) as well.\n\nAvailability (A). The attack doesn't directly affect availability, so A:N.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For Reflected XSS, the impact on confidentiality and integrity can be high. Availability is not directly affected unless the script causes a denial of service, which isn't mentioned here. So C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the User Interaction. The description says \"unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick an admin user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\" So the user has to click the link, which is user interaction. Therefore, UI:R. But some might argue that if the attack is via a link in an email, maybe it's considered as requiring user interaction. So UI:R is correct here.\n\nYes, that's right.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.9.6.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the EventON Pro plugin for WordPress. The issue is that there's a missing capability check in the 'assets/lib/settings/settings.js' file, allowing authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts would execute when a user accesses the injected page. The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.9.6.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The attacker needs to be authenticated, as the vulnerability is for authenticated users. But the attack vector here is Local (L) because the attacker has to be logged into the WordPress site. Wait, but sometimes if the attack is via a plugin, maybe it's network? Wait, no. The attacker is already authenticated, so the attack vector is Local. Because the attacker is on the same system or network, but the plugin is part of the WordPress site. Wait, the attack vector is how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. Since the attacker is authenticated, they can access the system locally. So AV is Local (L). But wait, maybe the attack is via the web interface, which is network? Hmm. Wait, the attack vector is about how the attacker can reach the vulnerability. If the attacker is already authenticated, they can access the system via the web interface, which is network. Wait, but the attack vector is determined by the method the attacker uses to exploit the vulnerability. For example, if the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network, then AV is Network (N). But in this case, the attacker is authenticated, so they have to be on the same network or have access to the system. Wait, maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be logged in. Wait, the CVSS defines AV as Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), or Physical (P). For a web application, if the attacker is authenticated, they can access the system via the web interface, which is considered a network attack. Wait, but the attack vector is about the method of exploitation. If the attacker is already authenticated, they can exploit the vulnerability through the web interface, which is a network attack. So AV would be Network (N). Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The attack vector is the path the attacker takes to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is authenticated, they can access the system via the web (network), so AV is Network. But some sources say that if the attacker is authenticated, the attack vector is Local. Wait, maybe I need to check the CVSS definitions. According to CVSS v3.1, Attack Vector (AV) is the method by which the vulnerability is exploited. For example, if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network, AV is N. If the attacker needs to be on the same physical machine, it's P. If the attacker is on the same network but not directly connected, it's A. If the attacker is already authenticated, then the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is already on the system. Wait, no. Wait, the attack vector is about the method of exploitation. If the attacker is authenticated, they can exploit the vulnerability through the web interface, which is a network-based attack. So AV would be Network (N). But I'm not sure. Let me check some examples. For example, if a vulnerability allows an authenticated user to execute code, the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is already on the system. Wait, but in web applications, even authenticated users are accessing via the network. So maybe AV is Network. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The CVSS defines AV as the method by which the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is authenticated, they can exploit the vulnerability through the web interface, which is a network-based attack. So AV would be Network (N). But some sources might consider it Local (L) because the attacker is already logged in. Wait, but the attack vector is about the method of exploitation, not the authentication status. So if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network, AV is N. If the attacker needs to be on the same system, it's L. In this case, the attacker is authenticated, so they can access the system via the web (network), so AV is Network (N). But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check the example given in the CVE description. The attacker is authenticated, so they can inject scripts into pages. So the attack is done via the web interface, which is a network attack. Therefore, AV is Network (N). Wait, but maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is already authenticated. Hmm. I think I need to refer to the CVSS guidelines. According to the CVSS v3.1 documentation, Attack Vector (AV) is the method by which the vulnerability is exploited. For example, if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network, AV is N. If the attacker needs to be on the same physical machine, it's P. If the attacker is on the same network but not directly connected, it's A. If the attacker is already authenticated, then the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is already on the system. Wait, but in web applications, even authenticated users are accessing via the network. So maybe AV is Network (N). This is confusing. Let me think of another example. If a vulnerability allows an authenticated user to read files, the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is already on the system. But in a web app, the attacker is accessing via the network. So maybe AV is Network (N). I'm not sure. Let me check the official CVSS documentation. According to the CVSS v3.1 specification, Attack Vector (AV) is the method by which the vulnerability is exploited. For example, if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network, AV is N. If the attacker needs to be on the same physical machine, it's P. If the attacker is on the same network but not directly connected, it's A. If the attacker is already authenticated, then the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is already on the system. Wait, but in a web application, the attacker is accessing via the network. So maybe AV is Network (N). Alternatively, if the attacker is already authenticated, the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is already on the system. I think the correct answer here is Local (L) because the attacker is authenticated and can exploit the vulnerability through the web interface, which is considered a local attack. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should look for similar examples. For example, if a vulnerability allows an authenticated user to execute code, the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is already on the system. But in reality, the attacker is accessing via the network. Hmm. I think I need to make a decision here. Let's proceed with AV as Network (N) because the attack is done over the network. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is already authenticated. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 examples. For example, a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to read data would have AV as Local (L). So in this case, the attacker is authenticated, so AV is Local (L). Therefore, AV is Local (L). \n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity is whether the attack requires special conditions. The description says that the attacker needs to have Subscriber-level access. So the attack requires the attacker to have a certain level of access. But the attack complexity is about the steps needed to exploit the vulnerability. If the attack requires the attacker to have a certain privilege level, that's part of the Privileges Required (PR) metric, not the attack complexity. So AC is Low (L) because the attack doesn't require any special steps beyond the attacker being authenticated. Wait, but the attack complexity is about the difficulty of the attack. If the attack is simple, then AC is Low. Since the attacker can exploit the vulnerability by being authenticated, the attack complexity is Low (L). \n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have Subscriber-level access or higher. So the privileges required are Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to be an admin, just a Subscriber. Wait, but the PR metric is about the level of privileges the attacker needs to have before exploiting the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have a certain privilege level, that's considered. For example, if the attacker needs to be an admin, then PR is High (H). But in this case, the attacker can be a Subscriber, which is a lower privilege level. So PR is Low (L). \n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says that the attacker can inject scripts into pages that execute when a user accesses them. The user interaction is required? The attacker injects the script, and then when a user visits the page, the script runs. So the user interaction is required (R) because the user has to access the page for the script to execute. Wait, but the attacker injects the script, and the user's interaction is needed for the script to run. So UI is Required (R). \n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The description says that the vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts into pages, which affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Since the vulnerability is in the plugin, and the attack affects the same component (the WordPress site", "prediction": "", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass the plugin's blacklist and upload .phar or other dangerous file types on the affected site's server, which may make remote code execution possible on the servers that are configured to handle .phar files as executable PHP scripts, particularly in default Apache+mod_php configurations where the file extension is not strictly validated before being passed to the PHP interpreter.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a WordPress plugin vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to exploit it. Since the attacker doesn't need to be authenticated and can do this remotely, AV should be Network (N). Because the attack is done over the network without needing to be on the same system.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions that the attacker can bypass the blacklist and upload dangerous files. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need special skills or steps beyond exploiting the vulnerability. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior access or privileges. They can exploit it from outside the system.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is None (N) since the attack can be done without any user interaction. The attacker just uploads the file, and the server processes it.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't change the scope. The same component (the plugin) is affected, and the attack doesn't elevate privileges beyond what's already possible.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is High (H) because the attacker can upload files that might lead to remote code execution, which could allow them to access sensitive data. However, the description says \"may make remote code execution possible,\" so the impact on confidentiality is high.\n\nIntegrity (I) is High (H) as the attacker can upload malicious files, which could alter the server's data or code, leading to unauthorized modifications.\n\nAvailability (A) is High (H) because the attack could lead to denial of service if the uploaded files cause the server to crash or be overwhelmed, or if the attacker exploits the code execution to take control, disrupting services.\n\nPutting it all together, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. Let me double-check each metric to ensure they align with the description. Yes, the attack is remote, low complexity, no privileges, no user interaction, same scope, high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts.

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `editar_permissoes.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `msg_c` parameter. The application fails to validate and sanitize user inputs in the `msg_c` parameter. This lack of validation permits the injection of malicious payloads, which are reflected back to the user's browser in the server's response and executed within the context of the victim's browser. This issue has been addressed in release version 3.2.6. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a Reflected XSS vulnerability in WeGIA. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a Reflected XSS, which means the attack is delivered via a link or some input that's reflected back to the user. Since the user has to click on the malicious link, the attack vector is Network (N). Wait, but sometimes XSS can be considered Local if it's in the same context. But in this case, the input is in a parameter, so it's delivered over the network. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires the attacker to inject a script into the msg_c parameter. The application doesn't validate or sanitize it. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need any special tools or steps beyond injecting the payload. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker doesn't need any prior access or privileges. They just need to get the user to click the malicious link. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The user has to click the link, so there's some interaction. But the UI metric here is whether the user interaction is required. Since the user has to click the link, that's required. Wait, but in the case of XSS, the user interaction is required for the attack to work. So UI:R? Wait, no. Wait, the UI metric is about whether the user interaction is required. For example, if the attack requires the user to click a link, then UI:R. But in some cases, like stored XSS, the user might not need to interact. But in reflected XSS, the user has to click the link. So UI:R. Wait, but the CVSS definition says UI:R means the user interaction is required. So in this case, the user has to click the malicious link, so UI:R. But I need to check. Wait, the description says the payload is reflected back to the user's browser. So the user has to be tricked into clicking the link, which is user interaction. So UI:R. But some sources might say that for XSS, UI is not required. Wait, no. Because the user has to be tricked into clicking the link. So the user interaction is required. So UI:R. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The CVSS UI metric is whether the attack requires user interaction. For example, if the attack is delivered via a link and the user has to click it, then UI:R. If the attack is automatic, like a stored XSS where the user doesn't need to do anything, then UI:N. So in this case, since the user has to click the link, UI:R. But I need to confirm. Let me check the CVSS documentation. According to CVSS v3.1, UI:R means the user interaction is required. So for reflected XSS, the user must click the link, so UI:R. So PR:N, UI:R.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain access to resources beyond those the user has. Since this is a reflected XSS, the attacker can't access other resources beyond the user's session. So the scope is Unchanged (U). So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts that execute in the user's browser. This can steal session cookies, etc., so confidentiality is compromised. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can modify the page content, but in reflected XSS, the attacker can't modify the user's data unless they have some way to do so. Wait, but in reflected XSS, the attacker can inject scripts that alter the page, but the integrity of the user's data isn't directly compromised. Wait, but the attacker can manipulate the page's content, which could be considered as modifying the integrity. However, in the case of reflected XSS, the attacker can't change the data stored on the server, but they can alter the page's content. So maybe I:H? Or is it that the integrity is not directly affected? Hmm. Wait, the integrity metric refers to the ability to modify data. If the attacker can inject scripts that alter the page's content, that's a change in the integrity of the application's data. But in this case, the user's data isn't being modified. Wait, maybe the integrity is not directly affected. Wait, the CVSS definition for I is the ability to modify the information that a user can read. So if the attacker can inject scripts that alter the page's content, that's a change in the integrity. So I:H. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the integrity is not affected because the attacker can't modify the data stored on the server. But the user's session might be compromised. Wait, the integrity is about the data that the user can read. If the attacker can inject scripts that alter the page's content, that's a change in the integrity of the application's data. So I:H. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. For example, if an attacker can inject a script that changes the page's content, that's a modification of the data that the user is viewing. So that would be a high integrity impact. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A). The vulnerability doesn't directly affect the availability of the system. The attacker can't cause denial of service. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:N (None), UI:R (Required), S:U (Unchanged), C:H (High), I:H (High), A:N (None).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought UI:R. But some sources might say that for XSS, UI is not required. Wait, the user has to click the link, so UI:R. But maybe the CVSS considers that the user interaction is required. So UI:R. But I need to confirm. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 definitions again. The UI metric is \"User Interaction (UI): None (N) or Required (R)\". For example, if the attack requires the user to take some action, like clicking a link, then UI:R. So in this case, the user has to click the link, so UI:R. So that's correct.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but the answer example given in the problem has UI:N. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The problem says the vulnerability is a Reflected XSS. In some cases, the UI might be considered as not required. Wait, no. Because the user has to be tricked into clicking the link. So the user interaction is required. So UI:R. But maybe the CVSS considers that the user interaction is not required. Wait, no. The user interaction is required for the attack to work. So UI:R. But I'm not sure. Let me think of another example. For example, a stored XSS would have UI:N because the user doesn't need to interact once the payload is stored. But for reflected XSS, the user has to click the link. So UI:R. So the answer should have UI:R. But maybe the user interaction is not required. Wait, the CVSS UI metric is about whether the user interaction is required. If the attack can be triggered without any user interaction, then UI:N. But in this case, the user has to click the link. So UI:R. Therefore, the vector string would have UI:R. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check some references. For example, according to the CVSS documentation, for XSS, the UI is typically R. For example, in the case of reflected XSS, the user must click a link, so UI:R. So I think that's correct. Therefore, the vector string would be as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the mediatek vcodec driver. The issue is that when the driver is in subdev mode, the parameter \"dev->pm.dev\" becomes NULL during the removal of the module. This leads to a kernel crash when trying to rmmod the module.\n\nSo, the main point here is that the vulnerability allows a kernel crash, which is a denial of service (DoS) because the system can't continue operating normally. Now, I need to map this to the CVSS metrics.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The crash occurs when the module is removed, which is a local action. The attacker would need to have local access to the system to rmmod the module. So AV should be Local (L). Wait, but sometimes if the module is loaded and the driver is in subdev mode, maybe it's possible through some local privilege. But the description doesn't mention remote access, so AV is Local.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires that the driver is in subdev mode. But the description doesn't specify if this is a low or high complexity. Since the attacker needs to have the driver in subdev mode, which might be a configuration choice, but the actual exploit might not require much complexity. However, the crash is triggered by a specific condition. I think AC is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to perform multiple steps, just load the module in subdev mode and then remove it.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to have the ability to rmmod the module, which typically requires root privileges. So PR is High (H) because the attacker needs to have elevated privileges to remove the module. Wait, but maybe the module is loaded as a kernel module, and the user can rmmod it if they have the necessary permissions. However, in Linux, rmmod requires root privileges. So PR is High (H) because the attacker needs to have administrative privileges.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The crash occurs when the module is removed, which is a system-level action. There's no mention of needing user interaction, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the kernel, and the crash is a DoS. The scope here is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope; it's still the same component (kernel) being affected. Wait, but if the crash leads to a DoS, does that change the scope? No, because the scope is about whether the attack affects a different component. Since the kernel is the same component, S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C). The crash doesn't leak any data, so C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I). The crash doesn't modify any data, so I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A). The crash causes the kernel to crash, which is a denial of service. So A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:H, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Let me double-check each metric again. \n\nAV: Local because the attacker needs to be on the same system. AC: Low because the attack is straightforward once the module is in subdev mode. PR: High because you need root to rmmod. UI: None. Scope: Unchanged. C, I: None. A: High. That seems right. The base score would be calculated based on these values. The final answer should be the vector string as specified.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.0999999999999996, "success": true}

Improper output encoding in the snipper viewer functionality lead to Cross-Site scripting attacks.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about GitLab CE/EE with a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the snipper viewer functionality. XSS typically allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Since this is a web-based application, the attack vector is likely Network (N) because the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network without needing physical access or local access. So AV:N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions \"improper output encoding\" leading to XSS. For XSS, the complexity is usually low because the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps. They can just inject the script. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) would be None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior access or privileges. They can exploit the vulnerability from a remote user's perspective without needing to authenticate or have any existing privileges.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is Required (R) for XSS because the user has to click on the malicious link or script. However, sometimes XSS can be considered as requiring no user interaction if the script is automatically executed, but in most cases, especially in reflected XSS, user interaction is needed. Wait, the description says \"Cross-Site scripting attacks.\" So maybe it's stored XSS or reflected. If it's reflected, the user has to click on a link, so UI:R. But if it's stored, maybe the user doesn't need to interact. Hmm. The description doesn't specify, but the fact that it's in the snipper viewer might imply that the user is viewing the snipper, so maybe the attacker injects the script into the snipper, and when another user views it, they get exploited. That would be stored XSS, which doesn't require user interaction. Wait, but stored XSS requires the attacker to have access to the application to store the malicious code, but the user interaction is when the user views the content. So maybe UI:R? Or is it considered that the user is already interacting with the application? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. For XSS, the user interaction is typically required because the user has to be tricked into clicking a link or viewing the malicious content. So UI:R. But some sources say that for XSS, UI is not required if it's a stored XSS where the user doesn't need to click anything. Wait, no. If the attacker injects the script into a page that's stored, then when another user visits that page, the script runs. So the user doesn't need to click anything, but the attacker has to get the user to visit the page. So maybe UI:R is not required. Wait, the CVSS UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. For example, if the user has to click a link, that's required. If the script is automatically executed without any user action, then UI:N. But in stored XSS, the user doesn't need to click anything, but the attacker has to get the user to view the page. However, the CVSS UI metric is about the attack's requirement for user interaction. So if the attack can be triggered without any user interaction (like a stored XSS where the user just visits the page), then UI:N. But if the attack requires the user to click a link (reflected XSS), then UI:R. The description says \"improper output encoding in the snipper viewer functionality lead to Cross-Site scripting attacks.\" So maybe it's reflected XSS, where the user has to click on a malicious link. Therefore, UI:R. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check some examples. For example, a reflected XSS would require user interaction, so UI:R. Stored XSS might not require user interaction, but the attacker has to get the user to visit the page. However, the CVSS UI metric is about the attack's requirement. If the attack can be triggered without user interaction, then UI:N. But in this case, the attacker has to inject the script into the snipper viewer, which is part of the application. If the snipper viewer is a feature where users can view snippets, then maybe the attacker can inject the script into a snippet, and when another user views that snippet, the script runs. That would be stored XSS, which doesn't require user interaction. Wait, but the user has to view the snippet. So the attacker has to get the user to view the malicious snippet. But the user's action of viewing the snippet is part of the attack. So maybe UI:R is not required. Wait, the UI metric is about whether the attack requires the user to take an action. If the user is already interacting with the application, then maybe UI:N. But I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the standard for XSS. According to CVSS, for XSS, the UI is typically Required (R) if it's reflected, but for stored XSS, it's sometimes considered as not requiring user interaction. However, the CVSS guidelines might have specific examples. For example, in the case of stored XSS, the user doesn't need to click anything, but the attacker has to get the user to view the content. However, the CVSS UI metric is about the attack's requirement. If the attack can be triggered without any user interaction (like a stored XSS where the user just visits the page), then UI:N. But if the user has to click a link, then UI:R. Since the description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is in the snipper viewer, which is a part of the application where users can view snippets, it's possible that the attacker injects the script into a snippet, and when another user views that snippet, the script runs. So the user's action of viewing the snippet is part of the attack. Therefore, UI:R. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the attack can be triggered without user interaction. Hmm. Let me check the CVSS documentation. According to the CVSS v3.1 documentation, for XSS, the UI is typically Required (R) if the attack requires the user to click on a link or interact with the page. However, if the XSS is stored and the user doesn't need to click anything, then UI:N. But in this case, the snipper viewer might be a feature where the user is viewing the snipper, so the attacker injects the script into the snipper, and when the user views it, the script runs. So the user's action of viewing the snipper is part of the attack. Therefore, UI:R. But I'm not certain. Maybe the answer expects UI:N. Wait, the user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. For example, in reflected XSS, the user has to click a link, so UI:R. In stored XSS, the user doesn't need to click, but the attacker has to get the user to view the page. However, the CVSS UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be triggered without any user interaction, then UI:N. But in stored XSS, the user has to visit the page, which is part of their normal interaction. So maybe UI:N. This is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The CVSS UI metric is about whether the attack requires the user to take an action. If the attack can be triggered without any user action (like a stored XSS where the user just visits the page), then UI:N. But if the user has to click a link (reflected XSS), then UI:R. Since the description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is in the snipper viewer, which is a part of the application where users can view snippets, it's possible that the attacker injects the script into a snippet, and when another user views that snippet, the script runs. So the user's action of viewing the snippet is part of the attack. Therefore, UI:R. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer expects UI:N. Alternatively, maybe the user interaction is not required because the script is automatically executed when the user is viewing the snipper. Wait, but the user has to be viewing the snipper. So the user is interacting with the application. Therefore, UI:N. Hmm. I think I need to make a decision here. Let's go with UI:N because the user is already interacting with the application, and the attack is triggered during that interaction. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability does not change the scope. The attack affects the same component (the application itself) and doesn't allow the attacker to gain access to other components. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is High (H) because XSS can allow the attacker to steal sensitive information, like cookies or session tokens. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I) is High (H) because the attacker can modify the content that users see, leading to potential data tampering. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A) is None (N) because XSS doesn't directly affect the availability of the service. So A:N.\n\nWait, but the description says \"improper output encoding in the snipper viewer functionality lead to Cross-Site scripting attacks.\" So the attack is XSS, which is a type of injection. For XSS, the CVSS metrics are typically: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but earlier I was confused about UI. Let me check standard examples.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring problem. The user provided a CVE description about a SQL Injection vulnerability in the Ebook Downloader plugin for WordPress. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, I'll recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The base metrics are Attack Vector (AV), Attack Complexity (AC), Privileges Required (PR), User Interaction (UI), Scope (S), Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). Each has specific options, and I need to choose the correct one based on the CVE description.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the 'download' parameter. Since the parameter is part of a URL, which is typically accessed over the network, the attack vector is Network (N). But wait, sometimes if the parameter is in a form or a request that's not directly over the network, but in this case, the parameter is part of a URL, so it's network-based. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The description says the vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping and lack of preparation on the SQL query. This suggests that the attacker doesn't need to modify the query in a complex way; they can just append SQL code. So the complexity is Low (L) because the attack doesn't require special tools or steps beyond the initial input.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker is unauthenticated, so they don't need any privileges. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says unauthenticated attackers can exploit this. Since the attack can be done without any user interaction, UI:N.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability allows extracting sensitive information from the database. Since the attack affects the same component (the database) that's being accessed, the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the attack can lead to other components being affected, like if the attacker can modify data or cause denial of service, then scope would be Changed. But the description mentions extracting sensitive info, which is confidentiality. So the scope remains the same component, so S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows extracting sensitive information, which is a high impact on confidentiality. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I). The description doesn't mention any modification of data, so Integrity is None (N). Unless the SQL injection could be used to alter data, but the CVE specifically says \"extract sensitive information\", so I:N.\n\nAvailability (A). The description doesn't mention any denial of service or availability issues. So A:N.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the attack could affect availability. If the SQL injection could cause the database to crash or be overwhelmed, but the CVE description doesn't mention that. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nBut wait, the user might have thought that the attack could lead to other impacts. Let me double-check. The CVE says \"extract sensitive information from the database\", which is confidentiality. So C:H. Integrity and Availability are not mentioned, so they are N. Scope is Unchanged because the attack doesn't change the scope, it's within the same component. So the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in SQL injection, if the attacker can modify data, then I would be High. But the description says \"extract sensitive information\", which is C. So I think the correct values are as above. Let me confirm each metric again.\n\nAttack Vector: Network (N) because the parameter is in the URL, which is network-based.\n\nAttack Complexity: Low (L) because the attacker can just append SQL code without complex steps.\n\nPrivileges Required: None (N) because unauthenticated.\n\nUser Interaction: None (N) because the attack is automated.\n\nScope: Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope, it's within the same component.\n\nConfidentiality: High (H) because sensitive data is extracted.\n\nIntegrity: None (N) because no data modification is mentioned.\n\nAvailability: None (N) because no denial of service.\n\nSo the final vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

The CVE is about a Reflected XSS vulnerability in a WordPress plugin. First, I need to figure out each of the base metrics.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). Reflected XSS typically occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into a web page, which are then executed by the user's browser. Since this is a web-based attack, the vector is Network (N) because the attack can be delivered over the network, like through a link. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps. Just injecting the script into the input, and the user clicks on the link. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior access or privileges. They can exploit this from a remote user's browser without needing to log in. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is Required (R) because the user has to click on the malicious link for the attack to work. The script is reflected in the response, but the user has to take action. So UI:R.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't change the scope. The attack affects the same component (the web page) and doesn't allow elevation of privilege. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is None (N) because the attack doesn't steal data. It's more about executing code, not accessing sensitive information. So C:N.\n\nIntegrity (I) is High (H) because the attacker can modify the web page's content, leading to unauthorized changes. For example, altering the page to display malicious content. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A) is None (N) because the attack doesn't directly impact the availability of the service. The XSS doesn't cause denial of service, but it's more about execution of code. So A:N.\n\nWait, but sometimes XSS can be used to cause DoS, but in this case, the description mentions Reflected XSS, which is more about execution rather than availability.

The user provided a CVE description, and I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let me start by recalling the CVSS v3.1 base metrics and their definitions.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the vulnerability is in an OS Command vulnerability, and the attacker needs to be authenticated with read-only permissions. The attacker can send crafted requests. Since the attacker is authenticated and needs to be on the same network (assuming the system is a server), maybe AV is Network (N)? Wait, but if the attacker is authenticated, does that mean they have access to the system? Wait, the description says \"authenticated attacker with at least read-only permission\". So the attacker has some level of access, but maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because they need to be authenticated. Wait, but the attack is via crafted requests. If the system is a service, maybe the attacker is on the same network. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in an OS command, so maybe the attacker can send commands through a network interface. If the attacker is authenticated, maybe they can send requests over the network. So AV would be Network (N). But I need to check if the attack requires local access. The description says \"authenticated attacker with read-only permission\" which suggests that the attacker is already authenticated, so maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because they have access to the system. Wait, but the attack is via crafted requests. If the system is a web service, the attacker could send requests over the network. So AV would be Network (N). But I'm not sure. Let me check the example. In the example given, the answer was AV:N. So maybe in this case, the attack is via network. Let me proceed with AV:N for now.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says the attacker needs to have read-only permission. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing to elevate privileges, then AC is Low (L). But if the attacker needs to have certain privileges, maybe AC is High (H). Wait, the attack requires the attacker to be authenticated with read-only permission. So the complexity is low because the attacker already has some level of access. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be authenticated, which implies that they have some level of access. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since the attacker is authenticated, but the vulnerability allows them to execute commands, maybe PR is Low (L) because the attacker already has some privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have read-only access, which is a low privilege level, then PR is Low (L). But if the attacker needs to have higher privileges, it would be High. But the description says \"authenticated attacker with at least read-only permission\", so PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The attacker can send crafted requests, which implies that the attack can be done without user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The description says the attacker can execute unauthorized commands. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges or access other components, then the scope is Changed (C). But if the attack is within the same component, then it's Unchanged (U). The description mentions \"execute unauthorized commands via crafted requests\", which might imply that the attacker can perform actions that affect the system's functionality, but it's not clear if it's a different scope. However, since the vulnerability is in the OS command, which is part of the same component, maybe the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the attacker can execute commands, that might allow them to escalate privileges, which would change the scope. But the description doesn't specify that. So I think S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows executing unauthorized commands. If the attacker can read data, then C is High (H). But the description says \"execute unauthorized commands\", which might imply that the attacker can access data (confidentiality) or modify data (integrity). But the exact impact isn't clear. However, since the attacker can execute commands, they might be able to read data, so C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): If the attacker can modify data or system files, then I is High (H). The description says \"execute unauthorized commands\", which could allow modification of data, so I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): If the attacker can cause denial of service, then A is High (H). The description doesn't mention availability, but executing unauthorized commands could lead to system crashes or resource exhaustion, so A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:H. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. Wait, but the example given in the problem had PR:N. Wait, maybe I made a mistake with PR. Let me recheck. The PR metric is the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is authenticated, does that mean they have some privileges? The description says \"authenticated attacker with at least read-only permission\". So the attacker already has some privileges (read-only), but the vulnerability allows them to execute commands. So the PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some privileges (read-only) to exploit the vulnerability. But in some cases, if the attacker doesn't need any privileges, PR is N. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is authenticated, that might mean they have some level of access, but the vulnerability might not require any additional privileges beyond that. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have read-only access, which is a low privilege level. So my initial thought was correct. Therefore, the vector is as above. But I need to make sure. Let me check the example again. The example given in the problem's final line was Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. Wait, in that example, PR was N. So maybe in this case, the PR is N. Wait, why? Because the attacker is authenticated, but maybe the PR is N because the attacker doesn't need to have any privileges beyond being authenticated. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is authenticated, that might mean they have some privileges, but the vulnerability might not require any additional privileges. For example, if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing to have any specific privileges beyond being authenticated, then PR is N. But the description says \"authenticated attacker with at least read-only permission\". So the attacker has read-only access, which is a low privilege level. So PR is Low (L). But maybe the PR is N because the attacker is already authenticated, and the vulnerability doesn't require any additional privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is authenticated, that might be considered as having some privileges, but the vulnerability might not require any additional privileges. For example, if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing to have any specific privileges beyond being authenticated, then PR is N. But the description says the attacker has read-only permission, which is a specific privilege. So maybe PR is Low (L). This is a bit confusing. Let me check the CVSS documentation. According to CVSS v3.1, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have some level of access (like being authenticated), then PR is Low (L). If the attacker doesn't need any privileges, it's N. So in this case, the attacker is authenticated, which implies they have some privileges. Therefore, PR is Low (L). So the vector would have PR:L. But the example given in the problem's final line had PR:N. Wait, maybe the example was different. Let me check the example again. The example given was Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. So in that example, PR was N. But in our case, the attacker is authenticated, so PR should be L. Hmm. Maybe the example was for a different scenario. Let me think again. The description says \"authenticated attacker with at least read-only permission\". So the attacker has read-only access, which is a low privilege level. Therefore, the PR is Low (L). So the vector would have PR:L. But I need to make sure. Another way: if the attacker is authenticated, that might be considered as having some privileges, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing to have any additional privileges beyond being authenticated, then PR is N. But if the attacker needs to have specific privileges (like read-only), then PR is L. So in this case, the attacker has read-only permission, which is a specific privilege, so PR is L. Therefore, the vector would have PR:L. So the final vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. But I need to confirm each metric again. Let me go through each one again.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The attacker is authenticated and sends crafted requests.

This vulnerability allows authenticated users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a stored XSS vulnerability in IBM QRadar SIEM. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is stored XSS, which means the attacker can inject code into the web UI. Since the user is authenticated, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit it. Wait, but stored XSS can be accessed by other users, so maybe it's Network (N)? Hmm, no. Stored XSS is when the attacker injects code that's stored on the server, and then other users (including authenticated ones) can be affected when they visit the page. But the initial attack vector for the attacker to inject the code would be through the web UI, which is local access. Wait, but the user is authenticated, so maybe AV is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit it. Or is it Network (N) because the code is stored and can be accessed by others over the network? I think AV is Local (L) because the attacker has to be authenticated to inject the code. So AV:N might not be right. Wait, no. The attack vector refers to how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is authenticated, then the attack vector is Local (L) because they need to be logged in. But if the code is stored and then accessed by others, maybe the attack vector is Network (N) because the code is delivered over the network. Wait, I'm confused. Let me check. For stored XSS, the attack vector is typically Local (L) because the attacker has to be authenticated to inject the code. Once injected, other users (including authenticated ones) can be affected, but the initial attack vector is Local. So AV:L. Wait, but some sources say that stored XSS is considered Network (N) because the payload is delivered over the network. Hmm. Maybe I need to think about the attack vector as how the attacker can reach the vulnerable component. Since the attacker is authenticated, they can access the web UI, so AV is Local (L). So AV:L. Wait, but the user is authenticated, so the attack vector is Local. So AV:L. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check some examples. For example, if a vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated, then AV is Local. So in this case, the attacker is authenticated, so AV is Local (L). So AV:L.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The complexity is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to perform any special steps beyond injecting the code. Once authenticated, they can inject the script, so the complexity is low. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be authenticated, so PR is Low (L) because they need to have user credentials. So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The user interaction is Required (R) because the user has to visit the page that contains the malicious script. Wait, but the user is the one who is authenticated. Wait, the description says \"authenticated users can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI\". So the attacker is authenticated, and they can inject the code. Then, when other users (including authenticated ones) access the page, the script runs. So for the initial attack, the user (attacker) has to be authenticated, but the user interaction for the victim is required. Wait, the UI metric refers to whether the user (victim) needs to interact with the exploit. In this case, the victim would have to click on a link or view the page with the malicious script. So UI:R. But the original attack requires the attacker to be authenticated, but the UI for the exploit is required. Wait, the UI metric is about whether the user (victim) needs to interact. If the exploit is triggered automatically, then UI:N. But in stored XSS, the victim has to visit the page, so UI:R. So UI:R.\n\nScope (S): The scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability does not allow the attacker to elevate privileges beyond the initial user's privileges. The attacker can't gain higher privileges, so the scope is unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows credentials disclosure within a trusted session. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can steal session cookies or other sensitive data. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can alter the intended functionality, which could lead to modifying data or UI elements. So integrity is High (H) because the attacker can change data or UI. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't directly affect availability, so A:N.\n\nWait, but the description says \"altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.\" So the main impact is on confidentiality (C:H) and integrity (I:H). Availability (A) is not mentioned, so A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:L (Local), AC:L (Low), PR:L (Low), UI:R (Required), S:U (Unchanged), C:H (High), I:H (High), A:N (None).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought AV might be N. Let me recheck. If the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is authenticated, but if the stored XSS is delivered over the network, maybe AV:N. Wait, the attack vector is how the attacker can reach the vulnerable component. If the attacker is authenticated, they can access the web UI, so AV is Local (L). But if the attacker can inject the code via the web UI, which is a local access, then AV:L. However, some sources might consider stored XSS as Network (N) because the payload is delivered over the network. But I think the correct approach here is that the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated to inject the code. So AV:L.\n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about UI. If the user (victim) has to interact with the page, then UI:R. But if the script is executed automatically, then UI:N. In stored XSS, the user (victim) has to visit the page, so UI:R. So UI:R is correct.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 1.1999999999999993, "success": true}

This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /api/backend/v1/user/create of the component User Avatar Handler. The manipulation of the argument Avatar leads to server-side request forgery. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to parse the CVE description and map each metric correctly. Let me start by recalling the base metrics for CVSS v3.1.\n\nThe CVE says the vulnerability is in the User Avatar Handler, specifically the /api/backend/v1/user/create endpoint. The issue is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) caused by manipulating the Avatar argument. The attack can be initiated remotely, which probably affects the Attack Vector (AV). \n\nAttack Vector (AV): Since the attack is initiated remotely, AV should be Network (N). That's straightforward. \n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description doesn't mention any complexity, so I assume it's Low (L). Unless there's a specific step needed, but SSRF often has low complexity because you just send a request with the malicious parameter.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The exploit doesn't require any specific privileges, so PR is None (N). The user doesn't need to be authenticated or have any prior access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says the exploit may be used and the attack is initiated remotely. There's no mention of needing user interaction, so UI is None (N). \n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the server-side, but does it change the scope? If the attack can affect resources beyond the original component, then Scope is Changed (C). But SSRF can lead to accessing internal resources, which might change the scope. However, the description doesn't specify that. Maybe it's Unchanged (U) unless the attack can escalate. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think. If the SSRF allows the attacker to make requests to other internal services, that would change the scope. But the CVE description doesn't mention that. The original component is the User Avatar Handler, so maybe the scope remains unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): SSRF can lead to data exfiltration, so maybe High (H). But if the attack is just making a request, maybe it's Low. Wait, the description says the manipulation leads to SSRF. If the attacker can make the server request any URL, they could potentially access internal resources, which would impact confidentiality. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I): If the attacker can manipulate the server's requests, maybe they can alter data. But the description doesn't mention that. So maybe I:N. Wait, but SSRF can be used to modify data if the server is configured to allow that. However, the CVE description doesn't specify that. So maybe I:N. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the SSRF is used to access internal services, maybe it's not directly affecting integrity. So I:N.\n\nAvailability (A): If the SSRF can cause the server to make requests that consume resources, leading to denial of service, then A:H. But the description doesn't mention that. So maybe A:N. However, sometimes SSRF can be used to cause DoS by making excessive requests. But without explicit info, it's safer to assume A:N.\n\nWait, but the vendor didn't respond, and the exploit is public. So maybe the impact is higher. Let me check again. The problem is that the attacker can manipulate the Avatar argument to cause SSRF. So the attacker can make the server make requests to any URL. That could lead to data exfiltration (C:H), but not necessarily. If the server is making requests to internal services, maybe the attacker can access internal data, so C:H. For integrity, if the server is making requests to a service that allows modification, then I:H. But the description doesn't specify. So maybe I:N. Availability could be H if the SSRF leads to DoS, but again, not mentioned. So maybe A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (remote), AC:L (low complexity), PR:N (no privileges), UI:N (no interaction), S:U (scope unchanged), C:H (confidentiality high), I:N (integrity none), A:N (availability none). \n\nWait, but some sources say that SSRF can have high integrity if the attacker can modify data. But without explicit info, maybe it's safer to go with I:N. Alternatively, if the attack can be used to modify data, then I:H. But the CVE description doesn't mention that. So I think I:N is correct here.\n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But wait, the answer example in the prompt has C:H, I:H, A:H. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem is that the vulnerability is a SSRF. SSRF can be used to access internal services, which would impact confidentiality (C:H). If the attacker can make the server request any URL, they could potentially access internal resources, leading to data leakage. So C:H. For integrity, if the attacker can make the server request a URL that modifies data, then I:H. But the description doesn't specify that. So maybe I:N. Availability could be H if the SSRF leads to DoS, but again, not mentioned. So A:N. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the vendor's response is not mentioned, but the exploit is public. However, the base metrics are based on the vulnerability's characteristics, not the disclosure. So I think the initial assessment holds. \n\nSo the final vector would be AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. But I'm not sure about I and A. Maybe the answer expects I:H and A:H. Let me think again. \n\nIn some cases, SSRF can be used to cause DoS by making the server make requests to external services, which could consume bandwidth or resources. So A:H. But again, the description doesn't mention that. So maybe A:N. \n\nAlternatively, if the attack is a SSRF, the impact on availability could be high if the server is making requests to external services that are not supposed to be accessed, leading to potential DoS. But without explicit info, it's safer to assume A:N. \n\nSo the final vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer expects I:H and A:H. Let me check some examples. \n\nFor example, a SSRF vulnerability might have C:H (confidentiality), I:N (integrity), A:N (availability). But sometimes, if the SSRF can be used to access internal services, maybe I:N. \n\nAlternatively, if the attacker can make the server request a URL that modifies data, then I:H. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think I:N is correct. \n\nSo the final answer would be the vector as above.

The vulnerability exists due to improper handling of the api_endpoint parameter, allowing an attacker to make direct requests to internal network services. This can lead to unauthorized access to internal servers and potentially expose sensitive information, including access to the AWS metadata endpoint.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The CVE is about an SSRF vulnerability in langgenius/dify version 0.9.1. The description says the issue is due to improper handling of the api_endpoint parameter, allowing attackers to make direct requests to internal network services. This can lead to unauthorized access to internal servers and expose sensitive info like AWS metadata.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). SSRF typically allows an attacker to make requests from the server to internal services. Since the attacker can exploit this from the network (like via a web request), AV is Network (N). But wait, sometimes SSRF might require the attacker to be on the same network, but the description mentions internal network services, which could be accessible via the network. So AV:N makes sense here.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is due to improper handling of a parameter. If the attacker can exploit it without needing additional steps, then AC is Low (L). Since the attacker just needs to provide the api_endpoint parameter, which is a single input, the complexity is low. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any prior privileges. They can exploit this from an unauthenticated user. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any need for user interaction. The attack can be done automatically, so UI:N.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows access to internal services, which might be a different scope. But the scope here refers to whether the attack affects a different component. Since the SSRF is within the same application, maybe the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the attacker can access internal services, which are part of the same system, then the scope might not change. However, if the attack leads to accessing external resources (like AWS), that's a different scope. But the description says \"internal network services\", so maybe the scope is Unchanged. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. If the attack is on the same component (like the server's internal services), then S:U. But if the attack can access external resources (like AWS), that's a different scope. However, the description says \"internal network services\", so maybe the scope is Unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability can expose sensitive information, like AWS metadata. So C:High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The description mentions unauthorized access to internal servers, but does it allow modification? The problem is about accessing internal services, not necessarily modifying them. So I:None (N) or maybe Low? Wait, the description says \"unauthorized access to internal servers and potentially expose sensitive information\". So maybe Integrity isn't affected. So I:N.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't mention anything about denial of service. So A:N.\n\nWait, but the user might have to check again. Let me recheck each metric.\n\nAttack Vector: Network (N) because the attacker can send requests from the network to internal services.\n\nAttack Complexity: Low (L) because the attacker just needs to provide the parameter.\n\nPrivileges Required: None (N) because no authentication is needed.\n\nUser Interaction: None (N) because the attack can be done without user interaction.\n\nScope: Unchanged (U) because the attack is within the same component (the server's internal services).\n\nConfidentiality: High (H) because sensitive data is exposed.\n\nIntegrity: None (N) because there's no mention of data modification.\n\nAvailability: None (N) because no denial of service is mentioned.\n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Wait, but the example in the problem shows C:H, I:H, A:H. But in this case, the description says \"expose sensitive information\" which is confidentiality, but maybe the attacker can also access internal services, which might affect integrity if they can modify something. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think I:N is correct. But maybe the answer expects different values. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says \"unauthorized access to internal servers and potentially expose sensitive information, including access to the AWS metadata endpoint.\" So the main impact is confidentiality (exposing data). Integrity and Availability aren't mentioned. So I:N and A:N. So the final vector would be AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. But I'm not sure about the scope. If the attack can access internal services, which are part of the same system, then the scope is unchanged. But if the attack can access external services (like AWS), that's a different scope. However, the description says \"internal network services\", so the scope is unchanged. So S:U. Therefore, the vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `tags.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `msg_e` parameter. The application fails to validate and sanitize user inputs in the `msg_e` parameter. This lack of validation permits the injection of malicious payloads, which are reflected back to the user's browser in the server's response and executed within the context of the victim's browser. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.6. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a Reflected XSS vulnerability in WeGIA. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the tags.php endpoint, and the input is the msg_e parameter. Since the attack is reflected back to the user's browser, it's likely that the attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a malicious link. That would be a Network attack because the payload is delivered over the network. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is Low or High. For XSS, usually, the complexity is Low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any special steps beyond injecting the payload. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None because the attacker doesn't need any prior access; they just need to get the user to click the malicious link. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is Required because the user has to click the link or visit a malicious site. So UI:R. Wait, but the description says the payload is reflected back. If the user is tricked into visiting a URL with the payload, that's user interaction. So UI:R.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to elevate privileges or access other systems. The impact is on the same scope. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is None because the XSS doesn't steal data directly. But wait, if the script can read cookies or other data, maybe C is Low. But the description doesn't mention that. It just says the script is executed in the context of the victim's browser. So maybe C is None. Wait, but the user's session might be compromised. Hmm. The description says the payload is reflected and executed, which could allow stealing session cookies. So maybe C is Low. But the question is about the base metrics. The base metrics are about the impact without considering scope. Wait, the scope is Unchanged, so the impact is on the same component. So for C, if the attacker can read data, then C is Low. But the description doesn't specify. Since it's a reflected XSS, the attacker can inject scripts that can steal data, so C is Low. But maybe the default is None. Wait, the base metrics for C are None, Low, High. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data, then C is Low. But if it's just execution, maybe C is None. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check. Reflected XSS can allow stealing cookies, which would be a confidentiality impact. So C:Low. But maybe the user is supposed to assume that the impact is High if the attack can be used to steal data. Wait, the CVSS scoring for XSS typically has C:High if the attack can be used to steal data. Wait, no. Wait, the base metrics for C are about the confidentiality impact. If the attacker can read data, then C is High. But in the case of XSS, the attacker can inject scripts that can read the user's cookies, which would be a confidentiality impact. So C:High. Wait, but the description says the application fails to validate and sanitize inputs, allowing injection. So the attacker can inject scripts that are executed in the context of the user's browser. That would allow the attacker to steal session cookies, which is a confidentiality issue. So C:High. But maybe the user is supposed to assume that the impact is High. Alternatively, maybe the answer expects C:High. Let me think again. The base metrics for C are None, Low, High. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data, then C is High. If it's just execution without data access, then C is None. But in XSS, the attacker can read data, so C:High. So I think C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I) is None because the attacker can't modify data unless they have some way to do that. But in reflected XSS, the attacker can inject scripts that modify the page, but that's more about the integrity of the page. Wait, the integrity metric refers to the ability to modify data. If the attacker can inject scripts that alter the page's content, that's an integrity impact. But the description says the payload is reflected back and executed. So the attacker can inject scripts that modify the page, which would be an integrity impact. So I:High. But maybe the answer is I:None. Wait, the base metrics for I are about the ability to modify data. If the attacker can inject scripts that alter the page, that's modifying the integrity of the application. So I:High. But maybe the answer is I:None. Hmm. This is tricky. Let me check. For example, in the case of XSS, the integrity impact is High because the attacker can modify the page's content. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A) is None because the vulnerability doesn't directly affect the availability of the system. The attacker can't cause denial of service. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:N (None), UI:R (Required), S:U (Unchanged), C:H (High), I:H (High), A:N (None).\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought UI:R. Let me confirm. The user interaction is required because the user has to click the malicious link. So UI:R. Yes. So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

The plugin prioritizes longer regex patterns over more specific ones when matching paths, which can lead to less restrictive CORS policies being applied to sensitive endpoints. This mismatch in regex pattern priority allows unauthorized cross-origin access to sensitive data or functionality, potentially exposing confidential information and increasing the risk of unauthorized actions by malicious actors.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in the flask-cors plugin. The main issue is an improper regex path matching where longer patterns are prioritized over more specific ones, leading to less restrictive CORS policies on sensitive endpoints. This allows unauthorized cross-origin access, exposing confidential info and enabling unauthorized actions.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is related to how the plugin processes regex patterns. Since the issue is about how the application handles requests, which could be from a network, I think AV is Network (N). But wait, the problem is with the application's internal logic, not necessarily an external network attack. Hmm. Wait, the vulnerability allows unauthorized access via cross-origin, which implies that the attacker could be from a different origin, so that's network-based. So AV:N makes sense.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is due to the regex priority logic. The attacker doesn't need to do anything complex; they just need to send a request that matches the incorrect pattern. So AC is Low (L) because the attack doesn't require special conditions.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any prior access or privileges. They can exploit this from the network, so PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack doesn't require user interaction. The attacker can exploit it automatically, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the confidentiality and integrity of the system. Since the impact is on the same component (the application's CORS handling), the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive data, does that change the scope? Wait, the scope is about whether the attack affects a different component. Since the CORS policy is part of the same application, the scope remains Unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive data, so Confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker could modify data if they can exploit the CORS policy to send requests. But the description mentions unauthorized access to data and functionality, which might imply that the attacker can perform actions, so Integrity could be High (H). Wait, the description says \"exposing confidential information and increasing the risk of unauthorized actions by malicious actors.\" So both confidentiality and integrity are affected. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A): The description doesn't mention any denial of service or availability issues. So Availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Let me double-check each metric again. Attack Vector is network because it's cross-origin. Attack Complexity is low. No privileges needed. No user interaction. Scope unchanged. Confidentiality and integrity high. Availability not affected.

A high privileged attacker with local access could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to BIOS upgrade denial.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in Dell Client Platform BIOS. The goal is to determine each base metric and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the CVE description carefully. The key points are: the vulnerability allows a high-privileged attacker with local access to exploit it, leading to BIOS upgrade denial. \n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The attacker needs local access, so AV should be Local (L). Because the attacker is on the same system, not over the network or adjacent. \n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is High (H) or Low (L). The description doesn't mention any complexity, but since the attacker needs high privileges, maybe the complexity is low? Wait, AC refers to the complexity of the attack. If the attacker can exploit it without needing additional steps, maybe it's Low. But I'm not sure. Wait, the vulnerability is about the Security Version Number being mutable to older versions. If the attacker can exploit it with just local access and high privileges, maybe the complexity is Low. But I need to check. The description says \"high privileged attacker with local access could potentially exploit this vulnerability\". So the attack requires high privileges, but the complexity might be low because it's a single step. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is High (H) because the attacker needs high privileges. The description says \"high privileged attacker\".\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is None (N) because the exploit doesn't require user interaction. The attacker can exploit it without any user action.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability affects the same component (BIOS) and doesn't change the scope. The impact is on the same component, so scope is unchanged.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability leads to BIOS upgrade denial. If the attacker can prevent the BIOS from upgrading, that might affect confidentiality? Or maybe not. Wait, BIOS upgrade denial could allow the attacker to keep the system in an older, vulnerable state. But does that affect confidentiality? Maybe not directly. However, if the attacker can prevent upgrades, they might maintain control over the system, which could be a confidentiality issue if they can access sensitive data. But the description doesn't mention data exposure. Alternatively, maybe the impact is on availability. Wait, the problem is that the attacker can deny the upgrade, which could prevent the system from getting security patches. That might be more about availability. But the question is about the metrics. Let me think again. The vulnerability allows the attacker to prevent the BIOS from upgrading. So, if the system can't be upgraded, the attacker might maintain control, which could affect integrity (if they can modify the BIOS) or availability (if the system can't function properly). But the description says \"BIOS upgrade denial\", which is about preventing the system from updating. That's more about availability. But the CVSS metrics for C, I, A are about confidentiality, integrity, availability. So if the attacker can prevent the upgrade, that might not directly affect confidentiality or integrity, but availability. However, the description says \"leading to BIOS upgrade denial\". So maybe the availability is affected because the system can't upgrade, which could be a denial of service. But the exact impact is not clear. Alternatively, maybe the attacker can modify the BIOS, which would affect integrity. But the description doesn't mention that. The problem is that the vulnerability is about the Security Version Number being mutable to older versions. So maybe the attacker can set the version to an older one, which could allow them to bypass security features. That would affect integrity (since the BIOS is tampered with) and maybe confidentiality if they can access data. But the description doesn't specify. Since the user says \"BIOS upgrade denial\", perhaps the main impact is on availability. But I'm not sure. Let me check the standard CVSS metrics. For example, if the attacker can prevent the system from upgrading, that could be a denial of service, which is availability. So A would be High (H). But maybe the attacker can also modify the BIOS, which would be integrity. However, the description doesn't mention that. The problem is that the description is a bit vague. Let me re-read the CVE description: \"A high privileged attacker with local access could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to BIOS upgrade denial.\" So the main impact is that the system can't upgrade the BIOS. That's a denial of service, so availability is affected. So A would be High. But what about confidentiality and integrity? If the attacker can prevent the upgrade, maybe they can keep the system in a vulnerable state, but that's more about availability. So C and I would be None (N). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the attacker can modify the BIOS, that would affect integrity. But the description doesn't mention that. So maybe C and I are None. But the user might expect that the vulnerability allows the attacker to prevent the upgrade, which could be a denial of service, so A is High. So for C, I, A: C is None, I is None, A is High. Wait, but the problem is that the attacker can prevent the upgrade, which might not directly affect confidentiality or integrity. So C and I would be None. But maybe the attacker can use the vulnerability to maintain control over the system, which could be a confidentiality issue. But without more info, I have to make an educated guess. The standard approach is to look for the impact. Since the description says \"BIOS upgrade denial\", which is a denial of service, so A is High. So A: High. C and I: None. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the attacker can modify the BIOS, which would affect integrity. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think the correct approach is to assume that the main impact is on availability. So A: High. C and I: None. \n\nWait, but the user might have different interpretations. Let me check the standard CVSS metrics. For example, if the vulnerability allows an attacker to prevent the system from upgrading, that's a denial of service, which is availability. So A is High. But if the attacker can also modify the BIOS, that would be integrity. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think the correct answer is A: High, C: None, I: None. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: High (H)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nWait, but the user's example has C:H, I:H, A:H. But in this case, the description doesn't mention confidentiality or integrity. So maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. The vulnerability is about the Security Version Number being mutable to older versions. If the attacker can set the version to an older one, that might allow them to bypass security features, which could affect integrity (since the BIOS is tampered with) and maybe confidentiality if they can access data. But the description doesn't specify. However, the main impact is the denial of upgrade, which is availability. So A is High. But if the attacker can modify the BIOS, that's integrity. But the description says \"leading to BIOS upgrade denial\", not that they can modify the BIOS. So maybe the impact is on availability. Therefore, C and I are None. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the attacker can prevent the upgrade, which could allow them to maintain the system in a vulnerable state, which could be a denial of service (availability) but also could allow them to maintain control, which might be integrity. But without explicit info, it's safer to assume that the main impact is availability. \n\nSo the final vector would be AV:L, AC:L, PR:H, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. \n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: the attacker can prevent the BIOS from upgrading, which could allow them to keep the system in a state where it's vulnerable to other attacks. That might affect confidentiality (if they can access data) or integrity (if they can modify the system). But again, the description doesn't specify. So the safest bet is to go with the information given. The description says \"BIOS upgrade denial\", which is a denial of service, so A is High. C and I are None. \n\nTherefore, the vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

This issue affects Plugin A/B Image Optimizer: from n/a through 3.3.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring problem. The user provided a CVE description about a path traversal vulnerability in a plugin. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, let me recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The ones mentioned are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Each has specific options. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a path traversal, which typically allows an attacker to access files outside the intended directory. Path traversal usually requires the attacker to have some form of access to the application. But since it's a path traversal, the attacker might be able to access files via the web interface. So, if the vulnerability is exploitable over the network, AV would be Network (N). But wait, path traversal could be local if the attacker has access to the server's file system. However, in most web applications, path traversal vulnerabilities are exploited remotely via HTTP requests. So I think AV is Network (N) here.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description doesn't mention any complexity. Path traversal usually doesn't require much complexity. The attacker can just send a malicious URL, so AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability allows path traversal, which might require the attacker to have some privileges. But if the plugin is a WordPress plugin, maybe the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges. If the vulnerability allows access to files without needing to be authenticated, then PR is None (N). But if the attacker needs to be logged in, then it's Low. The description doesn't specify, but since it's a path traversal, it's possible that the attacker can exploit it without authentication. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is a path traversal, which can be exploited without user interaction. The attacker can send a request directly. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The scope refers to whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different component. Since the path traversal allows access to other files, which might be different components, the scope could be Changed (C). But if the vulnerability only affects the same component, then it's Unchanged (U). Wait, path traversal might allow access to other parts of the system, so the scope is Changed (C). But I need to be careful here. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to read files from the server, which is a different component, then the scope is Changed. So S is Changed (C).\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows the attacker to read files, which is a confidentiality issue. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). If the attacker can modify files, then I would be High. But the description mentions path traversal, which is typically about reading files, not modifying. Unless the vulnerability allows writing, but the description doesn't mention that. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A). The vulnerability doesn't mention any impact on availability, like denial of service. So A is None (N).\n\nWait, but I need to check again. The description says \"Path Traversal\" which is about accessing files, so confidentiality is high. Integrity and availability are not mentioned. So I and A are None. But wait, sometimes path traversal can be used to overwrite files, but the description doesn't specify that. So I think I and A are None.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:N (None), UI:N (None), S:C (Changed), C:H (High), I:N (None), A:N (None).\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the scope. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to access other parts of the system, then the scope is Changed. For example, if the plugin's files are in a restricted directory, and the attacker can access other directories, that's a change in scope. So S:C is correct.\n\nBut some might argue that the scope is Unchanged if the vulnerability is within the same component. However, in the case of path traversal, the attacker can access files outside the intended directory, which is a different component. So S:C is correct.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 1.200000000000001, "success": true}

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of MedDream PACS Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DICOM files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-25826.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a buffer overflow vulnerability in MedDream PACS Server. The goal is to determine each base metric and calculate the base score. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The metrics are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description says it's a remote code execution vulnerability. Since the attacker can exploit this from a remote network, AV should be Network (N). That's straightforward.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. Typically, buffer overflows require some complexity, but if the exploit is simple, like just sending a crafted input, AC might be Low (L). The description mentions the lack of proper validation of data length, which suggests that the attack doesn't require complex steps. So AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The description states that authentication is not required. So PR is None (N). The attacker doesn't need any prior access or credentials.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The exploit can be done remotely without needing user interaction. The description says \"remote attackers can execute arbitrary code\" without mentioning any need for user action. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability allows remote code execution, which can lead to changing the scope. However, the question is whether the scope is unchanged or changed. Since the exploit can lead to code execution, which might allow the attacker to take control of the system, the scope could be Changed (C). Wait, but the base metrics for scope are whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. If the exploit allows the attacker to gain higher privileges or access other components, then S is Changed. But in this case, the vulnerability is in the DICOM file parsing, which is part of the service. If the attacker can execute code as the service account, that might be a different scope. However, the base score doesn't consider the scope for the base metrics unless the exploit changes the scope. Wait, the scope is about whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. If the exploit allows the attacker to gain access to other components, then S is Changed. But in this case, the service account is the one being exploited. So maybe the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack is within the same component. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The base score's scope is whether the vulnerability can be exploited to affect resources beyond those directly affected. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to take control of the service, which is a different component, then the scope is Changed. But the base score's scope is about whether the impact is on the same component or a different one. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain administrative privileges, that's a different scope. However, in this case, the service account is the one being exploited. If the service account has elevated privileges, then the scope might be Changed. But the base score's scope is determined by whether the vulnerability can be exploited to affect resources beyond the initial component. Since the exploit allows code execution, which could lead to further access, the scope is Changed (C). Wait, but the base score's scope is whether the impact is on the same component or a different one. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to take control of the service, which is part of the same component, then maybe it's Unchanged. I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS documentation. According to CVSS v3.1, the Scope metric is \"Changed (C)\" if the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new, separate impact on a different component. If the vulnerability can be exploited to affect the same component, then it's Unchanged. In this case, the vulnerability is in the DICOM parsing, which is part of the service. If the attacker can execute code as the service account, which is part of the same component, then the scope is Unchanged. However, if the service account has access to other components, then the scope might be Changed. But the base score's scope is about whether the impact is on the same component. Since the exploit is within the same component (the service), the scope is Unchanged (U). So I'll go with S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows remote code execution, which can lead to unauthorized access to data. So the confidentiality impact is High (H). The attacker can read sensitive information.\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the attacker can modify data or execute code, so integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The buffer overflow could lead to denial of service, so availability is High (H). The attacker can crash the service or cause it to become unavailable.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:N (None), UI:N (None), S:U (Unchanged), C:H (High), I:H (High), A:H (High). \n\nThe vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. \n\nWait, but I need to confirm the scope again. If the exploit allows the attacker to execute code as the service account, which might have higher privileges, then the scope could be Changed. But according to the base metrics, the scope is whether the vulnerability can be exploited to affect resources beyond those directly affected. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to take control of the service, which is part of the same component, then the scope is Unchanged. However, if the service account has access to other components, then the scope is Changed. But the base score's scope is about the impact on the same component. Since the vulnerability is in the service, and the exploit is within that component, the scope is Unchanged. So S:U is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 2.000000000000001, "success": true}

Not all drivers implement that callback, leading to NULL dereferences. Example of affected drivers: ptp_s390.c, ptp_vclock.c and ptp_mock.c. Instead use a dummy callback if no better was specified by the driver.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a Linux kernel vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the attack vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is a system-level component. The issue is that the ->enable callback isn't always set, leading to NULL dereferences. Since the problem is in the kernel, an attacker would need to have local access to exploit this. So AV should be Local (L). Wait, but wait—could it be Network (N)? No, because the vulnerability is in the kernel's internal handling, not through a network. So AV is Local.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The description says that the ioctl and sysfs handlers unconditionally call the callback. The problem is that some drivers don't implement it. So the attacker doesn't need to do anything complex; they just need to trigger the call. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability is in the kernel, so an attacker would need to have local access. But the question is, does the attacker need to have any privileges? Since it's a kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need to be local, but maybe they don't need elevated privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, maybe they don't need any additional privileges. So PR is None (N). Wait, but maybe the attacker needs to have some privileges to call the ioctl or sysfs handlers. Hmm. The description says that the handlers unconditionally call the callback. So if an attacker can trigger the ioctl or sysfs call, they can exploit this. But to trigger that, they need to be local. So PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to have any specific privileges beyond being local. Wait, but maybe the attacker needs to have some level of access. Let me think. The PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, then they can exploit it without needing any additional privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is triggered by calling the ioctl or sysfs handlers. The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges or access to other resources. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the issue is a NULL dereference, which could lead to a crash or privilege escalation. Wait, the scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. But in this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on the system's availability or integrity. Wait, the scope is about whether the impact is on the same component or a different one. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, then scope is Changed. But the description doesn't mention privilege escalation. It's a NULL dereference, which could lead to a crash (availability) or maybe a denial of service. So the scope is Unchanged (U) because the impact is on the same component (the kernel's functionality). So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability leads to a NULL dereference, which could cause a crash. But does it affect confidentiality? Probably not. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I). Similarly, the issue is a NULL dereference, which might not directly affect integrity. Unless the crash allows for some exploitation. But the description doesn't mention that. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A). The NULL dereference could lead to a crash, which affects availability. So A is High (H).\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem is that the callback is not set, leading to a NULL dereference. That would cause a crash, which is an availability issue. So A is High. But what about the other metrics?\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) because the vulnerability is in the kernel, requiring local access.\n\nAC: Low (L) because the attack is straightforward.\n\nPR: None (N) because the attacker needs to be local but doesn't need additional privileges.\n\nUI: None (N) because no user interaction is needed.\n\nS: Unchanged (U) because the impact is on the same component.\n\nC: None (N) because no confidentiality is affected.\n\nI: None (N) because no integrity is affected.\n\nA: High (H) because the crash affects availability.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the scope again. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a crash, which is a denial of service, that's an availability issue. But the scope is Unchanged because the attack doesn't change the scope. So S:U is correct.\n\nBut maybe the scope is Changed if the attack can lead to a different impact. But the description doesn't mention any privilege escalation or other components.

The user provided a CVE description about GitLab EE. First, I need to parse the description to figure out the base metrics.\n\nThe issue allows authenticated project owners to bypass group-level forking restrictions by manipulating API requests. So, the attacker needs to be authenticated, which relates to Privileges Required (PR). Since the user is an authenticated project owner, PR is likely Low (L) because they already have some privileges. Wait, but the description says \"authenticated project owners,\" so maybe PR is None (N)? Wait, no. The PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, then PR is Low (L) because they need to have some level of access. Wait, the CVSS PR metric defines Low as \"low privileges required to exploit the vulnerability,\" which could mean that the attacker needs to be authenticated. So in this case, since the attacker is an authenticated user, PR would be Low (L). But I need to check the exact definition. \n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is exploited via API requests. Since the API is typically accessed over the network, AV would be Network (N). Unless the API is only accessible locally, but the description doesn't mention that. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says the attacker manipulates API requests. If this requires some technical knowledge, like crafting specific requests, then AC is High (H). But if it's straightforward, maybe Low (L). The problem states \"manipulating API requests,\" which might be considered low complexity if the attacker can just send a modified request. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's High because the attacker needs to know the specific API endpoints and parameters. Hmm. Let me think. If the attack requires the attacker to have some knowledge of the API, like knowing the correct endpoints and parameters, that might be considered high complexity. But if it's a simple manipulation, maybe low. I'll go with High (H) for AC.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The attacker can exploit it without needing the user to do anything, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows bypassing group-level forking restrictions. If the attack affects the same security scope (like the same user's project), then Scope is Unchanged (U). If it allows the attacker to affect a different scope, like escalating privileges, then it's Changed (C). But the description says it's about bypassing group-level restrictions, which might be within the same scope. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The issue is about bypassing restrictions, which might not directly affect confidentiality. But if the attacker can access data they shouldn't, then C would be High. However, the description doesn't mention data exposure. So maybe C:N. Wait, but the problem is about bypassing forking restrictions. If the attacker can create a fork without group restrictions, maybe that's more about integrity or availability. Wait, forking could be related to creating new projects or repositories. If the attacker can create a fork, that might not directly impact confidentiality. But if the attacker can access data they shouldn't, then C would be High. Since the description doesn't specify, maybe C:N. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the bypass allows the attacker to create forks, which could be considered as affecting integrity (I) if they can modify data. But the description doesn't mention that. Hmm. Maybe the main impact is on integrity, allowing unauthorized forks. So I:H. But the question is about the base metrics. Let me check again. The problem says \"bypass group-level forking restrictions by manipulating API requests.\" So the attacker can create a fork without the group's restrictions. This might not directly impact confidentiality, but could affect integrity if the forked project is modified. However, the base metrics are about the impact. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a fork, which is a new project, maybe that's more about availability (A) if the system is overwhelmed, but that's not mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the impact is on integrity (I) if the attacker can alter data. But the description doesn't specify. Since the problem is about bypassing restrictions, perhaps the main impact is on integrity (I:H) because the attacker can create unauthorized forks, which might be considered as altering the system's state. Alternatively, maybe it's not affecting any of the three (C, I, A). But the problem states that the vulnerability could allow bypassing restrictions, which might not directly impact any of the three. However, the CVSS requires assigning values. If the description doesn't mention any specific impact, maybe the default is N for all. But that's not right. Let me think again. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to bypass group-level forking restrictions. If the group-level restrictions are about who can fork, then the attacker can create a fork without the group's permission. This might not directly impact confidentiality, but could affect integrity if the forked project is modified. However, the problem doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the impact is on availability if the system is overwhelmed by many forks. But again, not mentioned. Since the description doesn't specify, perhaps the impact is on integrity (I:H) because the attacker can create a fork, which is a change in the system's state. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the impact is on availability (A:H) if the system is affected. But without more info, I might have to make an educated guess. Let me check the original CVE description again. The problem says \"could have allowed authenticated project owners to bypass group-level forking restrictions by manipulating API requests.\" So the main impact is that the attacker can create a fork without the group's restrictions. This might not directly impact confidentiality, but could affect integrity if the forked project is modified. However, the base metrics require assigning values. If the description doesn't mention any specific impact, maybe the default is N for all. But that's not correct. The CVSS requires that the impact is determined based on the vulnerability. Since the attacker can bypass restrictions, which might allow them to create forks, which could be considered as altering the system's state (integrity), so I:H. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the impact is on availability (A:H) if the system is affected. But again, not sure. Let me think of similar examples. If a vulnerability allows an attacker to create unauthorized resources, that might be considered as affecting integrity (I:H) because the system's state is altered. So I'll go with I:H. For confidentiality (C), since the attacker is an authenticated user, maybe they can access data they shouldn't, but the description doesn't mention that. So C:N. Availability (A): If the attacker can create many forks, maybe it's a DoS, but the description doesn't mention that. So A:N. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:H (High complexity), PR:L (Low privileges required), UI:N (No user interaction), S:U (Scope unchanged), C:N, I:H, A:N.\n\nWait, but the user is authenticated, so PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated. So PR:L. \n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. \n\nBut I'm not sure about the attack complexity. If the attacker can manipulate API requests, maybe that's low complexity. For example, if the attacker can just send a modified request, that's low complexity. So AC:L. \n\nLet me re-evaluate AC. The attack complexity is the effort required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have some knowledge of the API, like knowing the correct endpoints and parameters, that's high complexity. But if it's a simple manipulation, like changing a parameter, that's low. The description says \"manipulating API requests,\" which could be considered low complexity. So AC:L. \n\nSo revising the metrics:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:H, A:N. \n\nBut then, what about the impact? If the attacker can bypass forking restrictions, maybe that's more about integrity (I:H) because they can create unauthorized forks. So I:H. \n\nSo the final vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. \n\nBut I need to make sure all the metrics are correctly assigned. Let me check each one again.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): Network (N) because the API is accessed over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L) because the attacker can manipulate requests, which might be straightforward.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated (project owner).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): None (N) because no user interaction is needed.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope (same user's project).\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N) because the issue is about bypassing restrictions, not data exposure.\n\nIntegrity (I): High (H) because the attacker can create unauthorized forks, altering the system's state.\n\nAvailability (A): None (N) because no impact on availability is mentioned.\n\nSo the vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. \n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"authenticated project owners\" which implies that the attacker already has some privileges.

This leads to a DoS attack via remote network. \n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the attack is via remote network. So AV should be Network (N).

The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need special tools or knowledge beyond creating a file.

Since the DoS is on the same server, the scope remains unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't disclose any confidential information. The crash is a DoS, so no data is leaked.\n\nIntegrity (I) is also None (N) because the attack doesn't modify data or compromise the integrity of the system. The server just crashes, but the data isn't altered.\n\nAvailability (A) is High (H) because the DoS attack directly impacts the availability of the service. The server crashes, making it unavailable to legitimate users.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the attack is via remote network, so AV:N. The DoS is a high impact on availability. So the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. \n\nLet me double-check each metric. Attack Vector is definitely Network. Attack Complexity is Low because the attacker just needs to create and upload a file, which is simple. No privileges required, no user interaction. Scope unchanged. No confidentiality or integrity impact, but availability is high. That seems right. So the final answer should be that vector string.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a SQL Injection vulnerability in a WordPress plugin. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the 'category' attribute of a shortcode. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have Contributor-level access, that suggests the attack is through a local vector. Wait, but the user is authenticated, so maybe it's Local (L)? Or is it Network (N)? Wait, the description says \"authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access\". So they have to be logged in, which implies local access. So AV should be Local (L). But wait, sometimes if the attack is through a plugin's shortcode, maybe it's considered network? Hmm, no. Because the attacker has to be authenticated, so they're already on the system. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping and lack of preparation. The attacker can append SQL queries. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any additional steps beyond providing the malicious input. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be authenticated with Contributor-level access. So that's a low privilege requirement. PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The attacker can exploit this without needing the user to do anything. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows extracting sensitive information from the database. Since the attack affects the same scope (the database is part of the same system), the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the attacker can access the database, does that change the scope? Wait, the scope is about whether the attack can affect resources beyond the initial component. Since the plugin is part of the WordPress site, and the attack is on the database, which is part of the same system, the scope is Unchanged (U). So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can extract sensitive information. That's a High (H) impact on confidentiality.\n\nIntegrity (I): The description doesn't mention any modification of data. So Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability is SQL Injection, which could potentially lead to data loss or denial of service, but the description doesn't specify that. Since the CVE only mentions extracting data, maybe Availability is None (N). Wait, but SQL Injection can sometimes lead to DoS. However, the description doesn't mention that. So maybe A is None (N). But I need to check. The original description says \"append additional SQL queries into existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information\". So the main impact is on confidentiality. So A is None.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For Scope (S), if the attack can affect other components, but in this case, the plugin is part of the WordPress site, so the scope is Unchanged. So S:U.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\nWait, but maybe the Attack Vector is Network? Let me think again. The attacker is authenticated, so they have to be on the same network? Or is it local? If the attacker is a user with Contributor access, they can access the site via the web interface. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is already authenticated and can access the site. So AV:L is correct.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in the Jeg Elementor Kit plugin for WordPress. The goal is to determine the base metrics and calculate the base score.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The metrics are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one based on the description.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability allows authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and has access to the system, this is likely a Local (L) attack vector. Because the attacker is already authenticated, they don't need to exploit a network vulnerability. So AV is Local (L).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions that the attacker can extract sensitive data via specific functions. The complexity here is probably Low (L) because the attack doesn't require complex steps. The attacker just needs to have access and use the functions mentioned. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is the level of access needed. The attacker has Contributor-level access, which is a low privilege level. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but in CVSS, PR is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker already has Contributor access, then the PR is Low because they don't need to escalate privileges. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is None (N) because the description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing user input. So UI is N.\n\nScope (S) refers to whether the vulnerability affects a different component. The description says the attacker can extract sensitive data, which is within the same component (the plugin). So Scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C) is High (H) because the vulnerability allows extraction of sensitive private data. The attacker can access confidential information, so C is H.\n\nIntegrity (I) is None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't mention any modification of data. The attacker is extracting data, not altering it. So I is N.\n\nAvailability (A) is None (N) as well. The vulnerability doesn't impact the availability of the system. The attacker is reading data, not causing denial of service. So A is N.\n\nPutting it all together, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Let me double-check each metric again to make sure. AV is Local because the attacker is authenticated. AC is Low because the attack is straightforward. PR is Low because the attacker already has Contributor access. UI is None. Scope is Unchanged. C is High, I and A are None. That seems correct. The base score would be calculated based on these values, but the question only asks for the vector string.

This vulnerability allows an authenticated user to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IBM Sterling B2B Integrator. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, let me recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The base metrics are Attack Vector (AV), Attack Complexity (AC), Privileges Required (PR), User Interaction (UI), Scope (S), Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). Each has specific options, and I need to choose the correct one based on the CVE description.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting issue. XSS typically allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Since the user is authenticated, the attack vector would be through the web interface. But wait, the description says \"authenticated user\" can embed JavaScript in the Web UI. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated to the system. Wait, but sometimes XSS can be considered as Network (N) if the attack is via a web page. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again. In XSS, the attacker can inject code into a web page that is then executed by the user's browser. If the user is authenticated, the attacker might need to be on the same network or have access to the user's session. But in the case of reflected XSS, the attack can be delivered via a link, which would be Network (N). However, the description mentions that the user is authenticated, so maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker has to be logged in. Wait, but the attack vector is about how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can inject code into the web UI, which is accessible via the web, then the attack vector could be Network (N) because the attacker can send the malicious script via a link or something. But the user is authenticated, so maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated. Wait, I'm confused here. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. For XSS, the attack vector is typically Network (N) because the attacker can send the malicious script via a link, which the user clicks. However, if the attacker is already authenticated, maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker has access to the system. Wait, but the user is authenticated, so the attacker might be able to exploit the vulnerability without needing to be on the same network. Hmm. Maybe the correct AV here is Network (N) because the attack can be delivered over the network via a malicious link. But the user is authenticated, so maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker has to be logged in. I need to clarify this. Let me think of examples. For example, if a vulnerability allows an authenticated user to inject code into the web UI, then the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker has to be authenticated and can access the UI. But in some cases, like reflected XSS, the attack can be delivered via a link, which would be Network (N). However, the description says the user is authenticated, so maybe the attack vector is Local (L). Wait, but the user is authenticated, so the attacker can exploit the vulnerability once they are logged in. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated and can access the system. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check some references. For example, in the case of XSS, the attack vector is often considered as Network (N) because the attacker can send the malicious script via a link. However, if the attacker is already authenticated, maybe the attack vector is Local (L). But I think the correct answer here is Network (N) because the attack can be delivered over the network. Wait, but the user is authenticated, so the attacker might not need to be on the same network. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me proceed with AV:N (Network) because the attack can be delivered via a web page, which is network-based. But I'm not 100% certain. Let me note that and move on, then come back if needed.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says the user can embed arbitrary JavaScript code. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any additional steps beyond injecting the script. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user is authenticated, so the attacker needs to have some level of access. However, the description says \"authenticated user\", which implies that the attacker already has credentials. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated, but that's a low privilege requirement. Wait, but in CVSS, PR is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, then PR is Low (L) because it's a low privilege requirement. Wait, no. Wait, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, then PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have a user account. But if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any privileges, then it's None (N). In this case, the attacker is authenticated, so they have some privileges. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but the description says \"authenticated user\", which means the attacker has to be logged in. So the privileges required are Low (L) because the attacker needs to have a valid account. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says the user can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI. For XSS, user interaction is often required. For example, the user has to click on a malicious link. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but in some cases, like stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact if the attacker has already injected the script. Wait, but in this case, the user is authenticated. So if the attacker injects the script into the Web UI, then the user (the authenticated user) would see the malicious code. Wait, maybe the user interaction is not required here. Wait, the description says \"an authenticated user to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI\". So the attacker is the authenticated user, and they can inject the code. So the user interaction is not required because the attacker is already authenticated and can inject the code. Wait, but the user interaction is about whether the user (the victim) has to interact with the malicious content. For example, in reflected XSS, the user has to click on a link. But in this case, the attacker is the authenticated user, so maybe the user interaction is not required. Wait, the description says the attacker can embed the code, which would then be executed when the user (the authenticated user) views the page. So the user interaction is required because the user has to view the page. Wait, but the attacker is the authenticated user. So the attacker can inject the code, and then the user (the same user) would see the malicious code. So the user interaction is not required because the attacker is the user. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. The user is authenticated, so the attacker is the user. So the attacker can inject the code into the UI, and when the user (the attacker) views the page, the code is executed. So the user interaction is not required because the attacker is the user. Therefore, UI is None (N). Wait, but in the case of XSS, the user interaction is required. For example, if the attacker sends a malicious link to the user, the user has to click on it. But in this case, the attacker is the authenticated user, so they can inject the code into the UI, and the user (the same user) would see the code. So the user interaction is not required. Therefore, UI is None (N). Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me check. The CVSS UI metric is whether the user interaction is required for the attack to succeed. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without the user interacting, then UI is None (N). If the user has to click on a link or perform an action, then UI is Required (R). In this case, the attacker is the authenticated user, so they can inject the code into the UI. Once the code is injected, the user (the same user) would see the malicious code when they view the page. So the user interaction is not required because the attacker is the user. Therefore, UI is None (N). But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is UI:R because the user has to be authenticated, but that's not the case. Wait, the user interaction is about the victim's interaction. If the attacker is the user, then the user (the attacker) is the one who is interacting. So the user interaction is not required. Therefore, UI is None (N). So I'll go with UI:N.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. In this case, the vulnerability is in the Web UI, and the attack affects the same component (the user's session). So the scope is Unchanged (U). Because the attack doesn't change the scope; it's within the same component. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows the attacker to alter the intended functionality, leading to credentials disclosure. So the attacker can steal credentials, which affects confidentiality. Therefore, C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can alter the intended functionality, which could lead to changing data or other actions. So the integrity is High (H) because the attacker can modify data or functionality.\n\nAvailability (A):", "prediction": "", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the adicionar_tipo_atendido.php endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the tipo parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.16.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a Stored XSS vulnerability in WeGIA. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the adicionar_tipo_atendido.php endpoint. Since the XSS is stored and executed when users access the page, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated to inject the script. Wait, but if the attacker can inject via a form submission, maybe it's Local. But if the attacker can do it remotely, maybe Network (N). Wait, the description says the script is stored on the server and executed when users access the page. So the attacker would need to have access to the application to inject the script. So AV is Local (L) because the attacker has to be authenticated to submit the payload. But wait, maybe the attacker can exploit this via a remote attack if the application is vulnerable to XSS without authentication. Hmm, but the description doesn't mention if authentication is required. Wait, the vulnerability is stored XSS, which typically requires the attacker to have some form of access to the application. So maybe AV is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated to inject the script. But if the application is publicly accessible, maybe the attack vector is Network (N). Wait, but stored XSS usually requires the attacker to have some way to inject the script, which might be through a form submission. So if the attacker can do that remotely, then AV is Network (N). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. Stored XSS is when the attacker injects a script that is stored on the server and then executed when other users visit the page. For that, the attacker needs to have access to the application to submit the malicious input. So if the application is accessible via the web, the attacker can inject the script by submitting a form, which would be a network attack. So AV would be Network (N). Wait, but maybe the attacker needs to be authenticated to submit the form. If the attacker is not authenticated, they can't inject the script. But the description doesn't specify if authentication is required. Hmm. The problem is that the CVSS metrics are based on the attack vector as per the exploit. If the attacker can inject the script via a network request (like a form submission) without needing to be authenticated, then AV is Network. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, then AV is Local. But the description doesn't mention authentication. So maybe the default is to assume that the attack vector is Network (N) because the script is stored and executed when users access the page, which is a remote attack. So I'll go with AV:N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is a stored XSS. The complexity here is low because the attacker can inject the script with minimal effort. They just need to submit the malicious input. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to have some level of access to inject the script. If the application requires authentication, then PR would be Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated. But if the attacker can inject without authentication, then PR is None (N). The description doesn't specify, but stored XSS typically requires the attacker to have some access, like being logged in. However, if the application is vulnerable to XSS without authentication, then PR is None. But since the description doesn't mention authentication, maybe it's safer to assume that the attacker needs to be authenticated. Wait, but the problem is that the CVSS metrics are based on the exploit. If the attacker can inject the script without needing any privileges, then PR is None. But if they need to be authenticated, then PR is Low. Since the description doesn't specify, but stored XSS can be exploited without authentication if the input is accessible to unauthenticated users. However, in many cases, stored XSS requires the attacker to have some form of access. But without more info, maybe the default is PR:N. Wait, but the example given in the problem might have different assumptions. Let me check. For example, if the attacker can inject the script via a form submission, which is a common scenario, then PR would be Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated to submit the form. But if the form is accessible to anyone, then PR is None. Since the description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is stored, I think the attacker needs to be authenticated to inject the script. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but maybe the attacker can inject the script without authentication. For example, if the form is public. But the description doesn't say. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The CVSS PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, then PR is Low. If not, then PR is None. Since the description doesn't mention authentication, but stored XSS can be exploited without authentication if the input is accessible. However, in many cases, stored XSS requires the attacker to have some access. But without knowing, maybe the default is PR:N. Wait, but the example given in the problem might have different assumptions. Let me check the example. The example given in the problem's final line is Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. So in that example, PR is N. So maybe the assumption here is that the attacker doesn't need any privileges. But in this case, the stored XSS is in a form that requires the attacker to submit the script. If the form is accessible to anyone, then PR is N. If the form requires authentication, then PR is L. Since the description doesn't specify, but the example uses PR:N, maybe the assumption is that the attacker can exploit it without needing any privileges. So I'll go with PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is stored XSS, which is executed automatically when users access the page. So no user interaction is required. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is stored XSS, the attacker can inject scripts that affect the same component (the application itself), so the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C). The attacker can steal user data via XSS, so confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can modify data stored on the server, so integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A). The attacker can't directly affect availability, so A is None (N).\n\nWait, but stored XSS can lead to session hijacking, which affects availability? Or maybe not. Availability is about denial of service. Since the attacker can't directly cause a denial of service, A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:N (None), UI:N (None), S:U (Unchanged), C:H (High), I:H (High), A:N (None).\n\nSo the vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but the example in the problem's final line has A:H. But in this case, the vulnerability is stored XSS, which doesn't directly affect availability. So A should be N. But maybe the example is different. Let me check again. The example given in the problem's final line is Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. But that's just an example. The actual answer here depends on the specific vulnerability. Since the stored XSS can't directly affect availability, A is N. So the correct vector would have A:N. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. If the attacker can inject scripts that cause the application to crash, then A would be High. But the description doesn't mention that. So A is N.\n\nSo the final vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 3.6999999999999993, "success": true}

This issue affects MB-Secure: from V11.04 before V12.53 and MB-Secure PRO from V01.06 before V03.09.Honeywell also recommends updating to the most recent version of this product.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about an OS command injection vulnerability in Honeywell MB-Secure. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is an OS command injection, which typically allows an attacker to execute commands on the system. If the vulnerability is exploitable over a network, AV would be Network (N). But if it's local, then Local (L). The description mentions \"Privilege Abuse,\" which might imply that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have some local access. However, command injection can often be done remotely if the input is not properly sanitized. But the description doesn't specify if it's remote or local. Wait, the problem says \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command\" which is a common vector for remote attacks. But the exact attack vector depends on how the input is handled. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I need to infer based on typical scenarios. If the vulnerability allows remote execution without authentication, AV would be Network. But if it's local, then Local. The description says \"Privilege Abuse,\" which might suggest that the attacker needs to have some level of access, but maybe not. Hmm. Let me think again. OS command injection can be exploited remotely if the input is accessible via a web interface or similar. So I'll assume AV is Network (N).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The complexity here refers to how difficult it is for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have some specific conditions, like being authenticated, that might increase complexity. But if the attack is straightforward, like sending a malicious command via a web form, then AC is Low (L). Since the description doesn't mention any additional steps, I'll go with Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability allows Privilege Abuse, which suggests that an attacker can gain higher privileges. But does that mean the attacker needs to have some initial privileges? If the vulnerability allows escalation, then PR might be Low (L) if the attacker can exploit it without needing prior privileges. Wait, the description says \"Privilege Abuse\" which might mean that the attacker can abuse their existing privileges to gain more. But the initial exploitation might not require any privileges. So PR could be None (N) if the attacker can exploit it without needing any prior access. However, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, then PR would be Low (L). The description doesn't specify, but since it's a command injection, maybe it's possible to exploit without authentication. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). If the attack requires user interaction, like the user having to click a link or confirm something, then UI is Required (R). But if the attack can be automated, then UI is None (N). Since it's a command injection, it's likely that the attacker can send the malicious input without user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The scope refers to whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. If the vulnerability allows privilege escalation, then the scope is Changed (C). The description mentions Privilege Abuse, which implies that the attacker can gain higher privileges, so the scope is Changed (C).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability allows Privilege Abuse, which could affect all three. If the attacker can execute commands, they can read files (C), modify data (I), and potentially cause denial of service (A). So all three are High (H). But wait, the description says \"Privilege Abuse\" which might mean that the attacker can gain higher privileges, which would affect all three. So C, I, and A are all High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Network (N)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Changed (C)\nC: High (H)\nI: High (H)\nA: High (H)\n\nThe vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\nWait, but the scope is Changed (C), so the vector should have S:C. Let me check the metrics again. Yes, the scope is Changed (C) because the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, which is a different component.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a Reflected XSS vulnerability in the Simple Amazon Affiliate plugin for WordPress. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, let's recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The ones mentioned are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a Reflected XSS, which typically requires the user to click on a malicious link. That means the attack vector is through the network, right? Because the attacker sends a malicious link (like in an email or a message) that the user clicks. So AV should be Network (N). Wait, but sometimes XSS can be considered as Local if it's in the same context. But in this case, since it's Reflected, the attack is delivered via a link, so AV:N makes sense.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). Reflected XSS usually doesn't require much complexity. The attacker just needs to get the user to click the link. So the complexity is Low (L). Because there's no need for the attacker to perform multiple steps or have any special setup. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker doesn't need any privileges. The user is unauthenticated, so the attacker can exploit this without needing to log in. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The user has to click the link, so there's a requirement for user interaction. Therefore, UI:R. Wait, but the description says \"unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\" So the user has to take an action, which is user interaction. So UI:R. But wait, sometimes in CVSS, if the attack requires the user to click a link, it's considered as requiring user interaction. So UI:R.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since this is a Reflected XSS, the attack affects the same component (the user's browser), so the scope is Unchanged (U). So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts, which can steal data. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can read sensitive information from the user's session. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can inject scripts, which could modify the page content. So integrity is High (H) because the attacker can alter the data. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A). The vulnerability doesn't directly affect availability. The attacker can't cause denial of service here. So A:N.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For Reflected XSS, the main impact is on confidentiality and integrity. Availability is not directly affected unless the attacker can cause a DoS, which isn't mentioned here. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the UI. The user has to click the link, so UI:R. But sometimes, in some cases, if the attack is delivered via a link, maybe it's considered as requiring user interaction. So UI:R is correct here.\n\nAnother thing to check: the scope. Since the attack is on the same component (the user's browser), the scope is unchanged. So S:U.\n\nYes, that seems right.

An attacker could send a specially crafted URL request containing \"dot dot\" sequences (/../) to view arbitrary files on the system.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The CVE is about IBM InfoSphere Information Server 11.7 allowing remote attackers to traverse directories via a crafted URL with \"dot dot\" sequences. So, the vulnerability is a directory traversal, which is a type of path traversal attack.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The attacker is sending a request over the network, so AV should be Network (N). Because the attack is done remotely without needing physical access or being adjacent.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The attack requires the attacker to craft a specific URL with \"../\" sequences. This seems like a low complexity because it doesn't require special tools or knowledge beyond knowing the exploit. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior access or privileges. They can exploit this from the network.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is None (N) since the attack can be done automatically without needing user input. The attacker just sends the request, and the system processes it without user action.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't change the scope. The attack affects the same component or system that's being targeted, so the scope isn't changed. Wait, but sometimes directory traversal can lead to accessing other parts of the system. Hmm. But according to the description, it's about viewing arbitrary files. If the system is designed to allow access to certain files, but the attacker can access others, maybe the scope is unchanged. Or maybe it's changed if the attack can access other parts. But I think in this case, since it's a directory traversal, the scope is unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is High (H) because the attacker can read arbitrary files, which is a confidentiality issue. They can access sensitive data stored on the server.\n\nIntegrity (I) is None (N) because the attack doesn't allow modifying files. The attacker can only read, not alter them. So no integrity impact.\n\nAvailability (A) is None (N) as well. The attack doesn't affect the availability of the system. The server is still operational, just the attacker can read files.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Wait, but the example in the problem shows a different vector. Let me check again. The example given in the problem's final line is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. Wait, but in my case, I thought I was N. But maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the vulnerability.\n\nThe problem states that the attacker can view arbitrary files. So confidentiality is high. But what about integrity? If the attacker can read files, but not modify them, then I is N. But maybe the attacker can overwrite files if they can write, but the description says \"traverse directories\" and \"view arbitrary files\". So no modification. So I remains N. Availability is also not affected. So the vector would be AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. But the example in the problem's final line has I:H. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the attack allows the attacker to modify files. But the description says \"view arbitrary files\", not modify. So I think I is N. But maybe the attacker can overwrite files if they can write. However, the description doesn't mention that. So I think I is N. So the vector would be C:H, I:N, A:N. But the example in the problem's final line has I:H. Wait, maybe the example is different. Let me check the problem again. The example given is Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. But that's just an example. The actual answer depends on the specific CVE.\n\nWait, the user's example is just an example, not the actual answer. So I need to focus on the given CVE. The CVE allows directory traversal, which is a way to access files. So confidentiality is high. But if the attacker can read files, that's C:H. Integrity is not affected unless they can modify files. Since the description doesn't mention modification, I is N. Availability is also not affected. So the vector would be AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. But maybe the user interaction is required? Wait, the attack is done via a URL, so no user interaction. So UI:N. So the final vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But I need to make sure all the metrics are correct.\n\nWait, maybe the scope is changed. If the attacker can access files outside the original scope, then S:C. But the problem says \"view arbitrary files on the system\". If the system is designed to serve certain files, but the attacker can access others, then the scope is changed. For example, if the application is supposed to serve only certain files, but the attacker can access others, that's a change in scope. So S:C. But I'm not sure. Let me think. The scope is changed if the attack affects a different component or system. For example, if the vulnerability allows access to another part of the system, then S:C. But in this case, the attacker is accessing files on the same system, so maybe the scope is unchanged. So S:U. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS documentation. Scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to create, modify, or delete resources that are not directly affected by the vulnerability. In this case, the attacker is accessing files, which might be part of the same component. So maybe S:U. But if the system is designed to have certain access controls, and the attack bypasses that, leading to access to other parts, then S:C. But without more info, I think S:U is safer. So I'll stick with S:U.\n\nSo the final vector is AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. But I need to check if any of the other metrics are different. For example, maybe the attack requires some privileges. But the description says \"remote attacker\", so PR:N. Attack complexity is low because the attacker just needs to send a crafted URL. So AC:L.

This is why information about affected and unaffected releases are unavailable.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to parse the CVE description and map each part to the base metrics. Let me start by recalling the CVSS v3.1 base metrics.\n\nThe description says the vulnerability is in aaluoxiang oa_system up to a certain commit. The issue is a path traversal in the ProcedureController.java file. The attack can be initiated remotely, and the exploit is public. The product doesn't use versioning, so affected versions aren't specified.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions the attack can be initiated remotely. That points to AV:N (Network) because the attacker doesn't need to be local or physical. So AV is Network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description doesn't mention anything about the complexity. Since there's no info, I should assume the default, which is Low (L). But wait, sometimes if the exploit requires specific conditions, it might be High. But here, since it's a path traversal, maybe it's low complexity. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in a controller, so maybe the attacker doesn't need any privileges. The description doesn't say anything about needing admin access. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The exploit is public and can be used, but does it require user interaction? The description doesn't mention that. If the attack can be done without user interaction, then UI:N. But sometimes path traversal might require some input from the user, but in many cases, it's automated. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability affects different components. The description says the product doesn't use versioning, but the vulnerability is in a specific file. Since the attack is on the application's functionality, and the scope is unchanged (the same component is affected), S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): Path traversal can allow reading files, so confidentiality could be high. But the description doesn't specify. However, since it's a path traversal, it's possible to access sensitive data, so C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I): If the attacker can modify files, then integrity would be high. But the description mentions path traversal, which is more about reading than writing. However, sometimes path traversal can be used to overwrite files. But the description doesn't specify. Since it's a path traversal, maybe the integrity is not directly affected. Wait, but the question is about the impact. If the vulnerability allows reading files, then confidentiality is high. If it allows writing, then integrity. But the description says \"manipulation leads to path traversal\", which is typically about reading. So maybe I:H is not correct. Wait, but maybe the attacker can overwrite files. Hmm. The description doesn't specify, so maybe I should assume that the integrity is not affected. But the problem is that the user might not have enough info. However, in the absence of specific info, perhaps the default is N. Wait, but the CVSS scoring requires making an educated guess based on the description. Since the vulnerability is a path traversal, which can lead to reading files, so confidentiality is high. But if the attacker can overwrite files, then integrity is high. But the description doesn't mention that. So maybe the answer is C:H and I:N. Wait, but the user might have to make a choice. Let me check again. The description says \"manipulation leads to path traversal\". Path traversal typically allows access to files outside the intended directory, which could be used to read files (confidentiality) or write files (integrity). But without explicit info, maybe the default is to assume that the impact is on confidentiality. However, sometimes path traversal can be used to overwrite files. But since the description doesn't specify, perhaps the answer is C:H and I:N. Alternatively, maybe the answer is C:H and I:H. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The problem states that the vulnerability is in the ProcedureController.java, which is a controller. If the path traversal allows the attacker to read files, then C:H. If it allows writing, then I:H. But the description doesn't specify. However, in many cases, path traversal is considered to allow reading, so C:H. But maybe the answer expects that since it's a path traversal, the integrity is not directly affected. Wait, but the user might have to make a choice. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example answer has C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, but that's just an example. Let me think again. The problem says the exploit is public and may be used. So the impact could be high on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. But without more info, maybe the answer is C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, but availability? If the attack is path traversal, maybe it doesn't directly affect availability. Unless the attacker can cause denial of service. But the description doesn't mention that. So A:N. But the example answer has A:H. Hmm. Maybe the answer is C:H, I:H, A:H. But I'm not sure. Let me check the original description again. The vulnerability is a path traversal. Path traversal can allow reading files, which is confidentiality. If the attacker can overwrite files, that's integrity. But the description doesn't specify. So maybe the answer is C:H, I:N, A:N. But that's not certain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is C:H, I:H, A:N. But I'm not sure. This is a bit tricky. Let me proceed with the assumption that the vulnerability allows reading files (C:H) and not affecting integrity (I:N) and availability (A:N). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is C:H, I:H, A:H. But I need to make a decision here. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example answer has C:H, I:H, A:H. So maybe the answer expects that. But I need to justify. Alternatively, maybe the answer is C:H, I:N, A:N. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem says the exploit is public and may be used. So the impact could be high on confidentiality. If the attacker can read files, that's C:H. If they can write, that's I:H. But the description doesn't specify. So perhaps the answer is C:H, I:N, A:N. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is C:H, I:H, A:N. But I need to make a choice. Let me proceed with C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the example answer has A:H. Maybe the answer is C:H, I:H, A:H. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is C:H, I:N, A:N. Hmm. This is a bit of a problem. Let me check the original description again. The vulnerability is a path traversal. Path traversal can be used to read files, which is confidentiality. But if the attacker can overwrite files, that's integrity. But the description doesn't mention that. So maybe the answer is C:H, I:N, A:N. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is C:H, I:H, A:N. But I need to make a decision. Let me proceed with C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the example answer has A:H. Maybe the answer is C:H, I:H, A:H.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain the administrator's token by sending a payload in the published chat. When the administrator views the conversation content through the monitoring/log function using Firefox, the XSS vulnerability is triggered, potentially exposing sensitive token information to the attacker.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is an XSS in langgenius/dify versions before 1.1.3, specifically affecting Firefox. The attacker can get the admin's token by sending a payload in a published chat. When the admin views the conversation via the monitoring/log function in Firefox, the XSS is triggered, exposing the token.\n\nSo, the main points here are: XSS vulnerability, affects Firefox, requires the admin to view the conversation, and the token is exposed. Let's break down each metric.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The attacker needs to send a payload in the chat. Since the admin has to view the conversation, which is a user action, but the attack is triggered when the admin accesses the monitoring/log. However, the payload is sent via the chat, which might be a network-based attack. Wait, but the admin has to be logged in to view the conversation. So maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because the admin is already authenticated and the payload is delivered through the application's interface. But wait, the payload is sent by the attacker to the chat, which is a network-based attack. Hmm. Wait, the attacker sends a payload in the published chat. So the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can send the payload over the network, and the admin accesses the chat through the browser. But the admin has to be logged in, so maybe it's Local? Or is it Network because the payload is sent via the network? I think AV is Network (N) because the attacker can send the payload through the network, and the admin's browser is the target. But maybe it's Local (L) because the admin is already authenticated and the attack is within the application. Wait, the attack vector is how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can send the payload via the network (like a web page), then AV is Network. But if the attacker needs to be on the same network or have local access, it's different. Since the vulnerability is in the chat, which is a web-based interface, the attack vector is likely Network (N). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The attacker sends a payload in the chat, which is a web-based interaction. The admin then views the chat, which is a user action. So the attack vector is Network because the payload is delivered over the network, and the admin's browser is the target. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The attacker needs to send the payload, and the admin has to view the conversation. Is the complexity low or high? If the attacker can send the payload without needing any special setup, then AC is Low (L). Since the attacker can just send the payload in the chat, and the admin's action is required to trigger the exploit, but the complexity is low because the attacker doesn't need to have any special privileges or setup. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any privileges to send the payload. The admin has to be logged in, but the attacker doesn't need to have admin privileges. The PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to have any privileges to exploit the vulnerability. Wait, but the admin is the one who is affected. However, the attacker doesn't need to have admin privileges; they just need to send the payload. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The admin has to view the conversation content. So the user interaction is Required (R) because the admin has to take an action (viewing the conversation) to trigger the exploit. So UI:R.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows the attacker to obtain the admin's token. The scope is Changed (C) because the attack affects a different component (the admin's token) than the one that was exploited. Wait, the vulnerability is in the chat, but the impact is on the admin's token. So the scope is Changed (C) because the attack affects a different component (the admin's token) than the one that was exploited. Wait, the original component is the chat, but the impact is on the admin's token. So the scope is Changed (C). But I need to check the CVSS definition. Scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. If the attack can be used to gain access to a different component (like the admin's token), then S:C. So S:C.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can obtain the admin's token, which is sensitive information. So C:High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability doesn't mention any modification of data, so I:None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't mention any denial of service, so A:None (N).\n\nWait, but the XSS can lead to stealing the token, which is a confidentiality issue. So C:H. Integrity and Availability are not affected. So the metrics would be:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:C, C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nWait, but the user interaction is required (UI:R) because the admin has to view the conversation. So that's correct. Scope is Changed (C) because the attack affects the admin's token, which is a different component. So the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if the scope is correct. The original component is the chat, and the impact is on the admin's token. So the scope is Changed (C). So yes, S:C.\n\nBut some might argue that the scope is Unchanged if the attack is within the same component. But since the token is part of the admin's account, which is a different component, the scope is Changed. So S:C.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

This can cause a deadlock in the scenario reported by syz-bot below: CPU0 CPU1 CPU2 ---- ---- ---- lock(console_owner); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(console_owner); As commit dbdda842fe96 (\"printk: Add console owner and waiter logic to load balance console writes\") said, such deadlock can be prevented by using printk_deferred() in kmalloc() (which is invoked in the section guarded by the port->lock). But there are too many printk() on the kmalloc() path, and kmalloc() can be called from anywhere, so changing printk() to printk_deferred() is too complicated and inelegant. Therefore, this patch chooses to specify __GFP_NOWARN to kmalloc(), so that printk() will not be called, and this deadlock problem can be avoided.

First, I need to understand the CVE description. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to a deadlock caused by calling printk() under a lock. The patch uses __GFP_NOWARN with kmalloc() to prevent printk() from being called, thus avoiding the deadlock.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so it's a local attack. But wait, the lockdep error shows that the issue is when a process is holding a lock and then tries to acquire another lock, which is a local scenario. So AV is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be in the kernel space, which is local.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity here is high because the attacker needs to be in the kernel, have the specific conditions where the locks are held, and the patch requires changing kmalloc() to use __GFP_NOWARN. It's not a simple exploit, so AC is High (H).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be in the kernel, so they already have high privileges. So PR is High (H) because the exploit requires kernel-level access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability doesn't require user interaction. The deadlock occurs during normal operation, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to gain higher privileges. The issue is about a deadlock, not escalating privileges.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability could lead to a deadlock, which might cause the system to hang, but does it affect confidentiality? The problem is about a deadlock, not data exposure. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the integrity isn't directly affected. The issue is about a deadlock, not data modification. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The deadlock can cause the system to hang, which affects availability. So A is High (H).\n\nWait, but the CVSS scoring for availability is based on the impact on system availability. If the system can't function properly due to a deadlock, that's a high impact. So A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: H (High)\nPR: H (High)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Wait, but I need to check again. Let me verify each metric again.\n\nAttack Vector: Local (L) because the attacker needs to be in the kernel, which is local.\n\nAttack Complexity: High (H) because the exploit requires specific conditions and changes to the code, which is complex.\n\nPrivileges Required: High (H) because the attacker must already be in the kernel.\n\nUser Interaction: None (N) because no user interaction is needed.\n\nScope: Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't allow privilege escalation.\n\nConfidentiality: None (N) because no data is leaked.\n\nIntegrity: None (N) because no data is modified.\n\nAvailability: High (H) because the system can become unresponsive.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

First, I need to parse the CVE description and map each metric correctly. Let me start by recalling the base metrics for CVSS v3.1.\n\nThe CVE says the vulnerability is in H3C SecCenter SMP-E1114P02 up to 20250513. The affected function is operationDailyOut in /safeEvent/download. The issue is path traversal via the filename argument, and the attack can be launched remotely. The exploit is public and the vendor didn't respond.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions the attack can be launched remotely. So AV should be Network (N) because the attacker doesn't need physical access or local access. They can exploit it over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description doesn't specify if the attack requires complex steps. Since path traversal is often a simple exploit, maybe AC is Low (L). But I need to check if there's any mention of complexity. The exploit is public, but that doesn't directly affect AC. So I'll go with Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in a function that's part of the application. If the attacker doesn't need any prior access, PR is None (N). Since it's a remote exploit, the attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, so PR is N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The exploit is public and can be launched remotely. The description doesn't mention needing user interaction, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows path traversal, which could lead to reading files. If the attack affects the confidentiality (C) but doesn't change the scope (like if it's the same component), then S is Unchanged (U). But if the attack can lead to other components being affected, like changing the scope, then S would be Changed (C). However, the description doesn't mention that. So I think S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): Path traversal can allow reading files, so C is High (H). The attacker can access sensitive data.\n\nIntegrity (I): If the path traversal allows writing, then I would be High. But the description says the argument is manipulated to traverse the path, which is more about reading. So I might be None (N) unless there's a way to modify files. The description doesn't mention that, so I'll assume I is N.\n\nAvailability (A): The exploit doesn't mention any denial of service, so A is None (N).\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check again. The vulnerability is path traversal, which is about accessing files. So C is High. If the attacker can overwrite files, then I would be High. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think I is N. Availability isn't mentioned, so A is N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Then the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But wait, the example in the problem shows C:H, I:H, A:H. Maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says the exploit is public and may be used. The vulnerability is in a function that's part of the application. If the path traversal allows reading files (C:H) and maybe modifying them (I:H) if the attacker can write, but the description doesn't specify that. The original description says \"manipulation of the argument filename leads to path traversal.\" So the attacker can access files, which is C:H. If the attacker can also modify files, then I would be H. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think I is N. Availability isn't mentioned, so A is N. So the vector would have C:H, I:N, A:N. But maybe the vendor's response is not relevant here. Let me confirm the metrics again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the attack can lead to arbitrary file access, which is a high confidentiality impact. So C:H. If the attack doesn't affect integrity or availability, then I:N and A:N. So the final vector is as above.

However, since it's a kernel vulnerability, it's possible that an attacker could exploit it remotely if they can somehow trigger the vulnerability through a network. But the description doesn't mention any network-based exploitation. The issue is related to interrupt handling, which is typically a local privilege escalation problem. So AV is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to be on the same system. Wait, but sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger them via network. However, the description doesn't mention any network-based attack vector. So I think AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires the attacker to have some knowledge of the system's internal workings, like knowing how the interrupt handling is structured. The fix involves changing the lock mechanism, which suggests that the exploit might require specific conditions to be met. However, the complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to have any special tools or knowledge beyond what's necessary to trigger the vulnerability. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have some level of privilege to exploit it. However, the description doesn't specify if the attacker needs to be a privileged user or if it's a privilege escalation. Since the issue is about enabling interrupts in a disabled section, which could be part of a privilege escalation, but the initial access might require local access. However, the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without any prior privileges, then PR is None (N). But if the attacker needs to be a local user with some privileges, then it's Low (L). The description doesn't mention that the attacker needs to be a privileged user, so I think PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability doesn't require any user interaction. The issue is in the code's logic, so an attacker can exploit it without needing a user to click or do anything. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The scope refers to whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain access to a different component or privilege level. Since this is a kernel vulnerability, if exploited, it could allow the attacker to gain higher privileges (like root), which would change the scope. However, the description doesn't explicitly state that the vulnerability allows privilege escalation. But the fact that it's a kernel issue and the fix involves a lock mechanism suggests that it might be a privilege escalation. Therefore, the scope is Changed (C) because the attacker could gain higher privileges.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows the attacker to enable interrupts in a disabled section. This could lead to information leakage if the interrupt handling is used to access sensitive data. However, the description doesn't mention confidentiality issues. So I think C is None (N) unless there's a possibility of data exposure. But since the main issue is about interrupt handling, maybe it's not directly affecting confidentiality. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I). If the attacker can manipulate the interrupt handling, they might be able to alter the system's state, leading to integrity issues. However, the description doesn't mention that. The main issue is about enabling interrupts in a disabled section, which could lead to unexpected behavior, but not necessarily altering data. So I might consider I as None (N). But if the vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution, then I would be High. However, the description doesn't mention that. So I think I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A). The vulnerability could lead to denial of service if the interrupt handling is disrupted. For example, if the interrupts are enabled when they shouldn't be, it could cause the system to crash or behave unpredictably. So A is High (H) because it could lead to system instability or crashes.\n\nWait, but I need to double-check each metric. Let me go through them again.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): Local (L) because it's a kernel vulnerability, requiring local access.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L) because the exploit doesn't require complex steps.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N) because the attacker doesn't need prior privileges to exploit it.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): None (N) because no user interaction is needed.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C) because the vulnerability could allow privilege escalation.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N) unless there's data exposure, which isn't mentioned.\n\nIntegrity (I): None (N) unless the system's integrity is compromised, which isn't clear.\n\nAvailability (A): High (H) because the system could crash or become unstable.\n\nWait, but maybe the scope is Unchanged (U) if the vulnerability doesn't allow changing the scope. If the attacker can't gain higher privileges, then S is Unchanged. But the description mentions that the fix is related to a lock that was incorrectly enabling interrupts, which could be a privilege escalation. However, the original code might have been using raw_spin_lock_irqsave(), which disables interrupts, and the new code with guard(raw_spinlock_irq) might not be doing that. So if the attacker can exploit this, they might be able to enable interrupts when they shouldn't, leading to potential privilege escalation. Therefore, the scope is Changed (C).\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component or privilege level. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges (like root), then the scope is Changed. If it's within the same privilege level, then it's Unchanged. Since this is a kernel vulnerability, and the fix is about interrupt handling, which is a core part of the system, it's possible that the vulnerability could be used for privilege escalation. Therefore, S is Changed (C).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAV: L\nAC: L\nPR: N\nUI: N\nS: C\nC: N\nI: N\nA: H\n\nWait, but maybe the availability is High because the system could crash. So the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nBut I need to check if the other metrics are correct. For example, if the vulnerability allows for privilege escalation, then the scope is Changed. But if the vulnerability is a DoS, then the availability is High. However, the description doesn't mention DoS, but the fact that enabling interrupts in a disabled section could lead to system instability. So A is High.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the integrity is High if the attacker can manipulate the system's state. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think the initial assessment is correct.\n\nSo the final vector would be:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.5999999999999996, "success": true}

This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected Sony XAV-AX8500 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the implementation of ACL-U links. The issue results from the lack of L2CAP channel isolation. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-26284.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a Bluetooth vulnerability in Sony's XAV-AX8500. The goal is to determine each base metric and calculate the base score. Let me start by recalling the CVSS v3.1 base metrics.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication. So, the attacker is on the same network, which would be \"Network (N)\"? Wait, no. Wait, network-adjacent is Adjacent (A), right? Because AV options are Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), Physical (P). So if the attacker is on the same network, that's N. But the description says \"network-adjacent attackers\", which might mean they are adjacent, like on the same local network. Wait, but sometimes \"network-adjacent\" can be considered as adjacent (A), which is a different category. Wait, the exact wording is \"network-adjacent attackers\". Let me check the CVSS definitions. Attack Vector is the path by which the attack is delivered. If the attacker is on the same network, that's AV:N. But if they are adjacent, like physically nearby, that's AV:A. Wait, but the description says \"network-adjacent\", which might imply that the attacker is on the same network, so AV:N. Hmm, but maybe the term \"network-adjacent\" here refers to being on the same local network, which would be AV:N. Wait, but sometimes \"adjacent\" is considered as being on the same network. Wait, I need to be careful here. Let me think again. The vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication. So the attacker is on the same network, which would be AV:N. But maybe the term \"network-adjacent\" is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the attack requires the attacker to be adjacent to the device, like physically nearby, which would be AV:A. But the description says \"network-adjacent\", which might imply that the attacker is on the same network. For example, if the device is connected to a network, and the attacker is on that network, then AV:N. But if the attacker is adjacent to the device, like in the same physical location, that's AV:A. The description says \"network-adjacent attackers\", so maybe it's AV:N. Wait, but the term \"network-adjacent\" is a bit unclear. Let me check the CVSS documentation. According to CVSS v3.1, Attack Vector (AV) is the path by which the attack is delivered. The options are: Network (N) - attack is delivered over a network, Adjacent (A) - attack is delivered via a physically adjacent network, Local (L) - attack is delivered via local access, Physical (P) - attack requires physical access. So if the attacker is on the same network, that's AV:N. If they are adjacent (like on the same local network but not directly connected), maybe AV:A. Wait, but the term \"network-adjacent\" might mean that the attacker is on the same network, so AV:N. However, sometimes \"adjacent\" is considered as being on the same network. Wait, maybe the correct AV here is Adjacent (A) because the attacker is on the same network. Wait, but the description says \"network-adjacent attackers\", which might mean that the attacker is on the same network. So AV:N. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example in the problem's final line is Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. So in that example, AV:N is used. But in this case, the attacker is network-adjacent. Wait, maybe the correct AV is Adjacent (A) because the attacker is on the same network. Wait, but the term \"network-adjacent\" might be a bit of a red herring. Let me think again. The vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication. So the attacker is on the same network, which would be AV:N. But if the attacker is adjacent to the device, like physically nearby, that's AV:A. But the description says \"network-adjacent\", which implies that the attacker is on the same network. So AV:N. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me proceed with AV:N for now, but I'll need to verify.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says that authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. So the attack doesn't require any user interaction, and the complexity is low. Wait, the AC metric is about the complexity of the attack. If the attack requires no user interaction and is easy to exploit, then AC is Low (L). The description says \"Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\" So the attack doesn't require any user interaction, so UI is N. But AC is about the complexity. If the attack can be done without any user interaction, then AC is Low. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The description says \"Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\" So the attacker doesn't need any privileges. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says \"Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\" So the attack doesn't require any user interaction. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges. The description says the attacker can bypass authentication. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain access to the system, then the scope is Changed (C). Wait, the scope is whether the attack affects resources beyond those directly affected. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to bypass authentication, which is a privilege escalation, then the scope would be Changed (C). But I need to check. The scope is \"Unchanged (U) if the vulnerability does not allow the attacker to gain higher privileges, or Changed (C) if the attacker can gain higher privileges.\" Since the attacker can bypass authentication, which is a privilege, then the scope is Changed (C). Wait, but maybe the scope is Unchanged if the attack doesn't allow the attacker to access other resources. Wait, the description says the attacker can bypass authentication on the system. So if the attacker can access the system without authentication, that's a privilege escalation, so the scope is Changed (C). So S:C.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows the attacker to bypass authentication. If the attacker can access the system without authentication, they might be able to read data, so C is High (H). But the description doesn't specify if data is exposed. However, since the attacker can bypass authentication, which is a privilege, it's likely that confidentiality is compromised. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I): If the attacker can modify data, then I is High. The description says the attacker can bypass authentication, but it's not clear if they can modify data. However, since the vulnerability is about authentication bypass, maybe the integrity is not directly affected. Wait, but the description says the attacker can bypass authentication, which might allow them to perform actions that could modify data. However, the problem states that the specific flaw is in the ACL-U links and lack of L2CAP channel isolation. So maybe the attacker can access the system without authentication, which could allow them to modify data. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A): The description doesn't mention anything about denial of service. So A:N.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The description says the attacker can bypass authentication. So if the attacker can access the system without authentication, they might be able to perform actions that could affect availability, but the description doesn't mention that. So A:N.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nAV: N (network-adjacent attackers, but maybe A? Wait, earlier confusion here. Let me re-examine. The description says \"network-adjacent attackers\". According to CVSS, Attack Vector (AV) is the path by which the attack is delivered. If the attacker is on the same network, that's AV:N. If the attacker is adjacent (like on the same local network but not directly connected), that's AV:A. But the term \"network-adjacent\" might mean that the attacker is on the same network. So AV:N. However, sometimes \"adjacent\" is considered as being on the same network. Wait, the term \"network-adjacent\" is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the CVSS documentation again. According to the CVSS v3.1 specification, Attack Vector (AV) is defined as follows:\n\n- Network (N): Attack is delivered over a network.\n- Adjacent (A): Attack is delivered via a physically adjacent network.\n- Local (L): Attack is delivered via local access.\n- Physical (P): Attack requires physical access.\n\nSo if the attacker is on the same network, that's AV:N. If the attacker is adjacent (like on the same local network but not directly connected), that's AV:A. But the description says \"network-adjacent attackers\", which might imply that the attacker is on the same network. So AV:N. However, sometimes \"adjacent\" is considered as being on the same network. Wait, but the term \"network-adjacent\" might be a bit of a misnomer. For example, if the device is connected to a network, and the attacker is on that network, then AV:N. If the attacker is adjacent to the device (like physically nearby), that's AV:A. But the description says \"network-adjacent\", which might mean that the attacker is on the same network. So AV:N.

This issue is fixed in macOS Ventura 13.7.3, macOS Sequoia 15.3, macOS Sonoma 14.7.3. A malicious application may be able to leak sensitive user information.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description and wants me to determine each base metric and then the vector string. Let me start by recalling the CVSS v3.1 base metrics.\n\nFirst, the CVE says a malicious application can leak sensitive user information. The fix is in specific macOS versions. Let me go through each metric one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The description mentions a malicious application. Since it's an application, that's typically local access. But wait, if the app is malicious, maybe it's running on the same system, so AV would be Local (L). But sometimes, if the app is from an external source, maybe it's Network (N)? Hmm. Wait, the description doesn't specify if the attack is through a network or local. But the fact that it's a malicious application suggests that the attacker has some local access. So AV is Local (L). But I need to be careful here. If the app is installed locally, then AV is Local. If it's a remote exploit, then Network. But the description doesn't mention remote, so I think AV is Local.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says the issue was fixed with improved state management. The attack complexity here might be Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to have any special setup. But I'm not sure. If the attack requires some specific conditions, maybe High. But since the fix is about state management, maybe the attack is straightforward. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have some privileges to install a malicious application. But if the app is already installed, maybe the attacker has local access. However, the description doesn't specify if the attacker needs to have any specific privileges. If the app is a local application, maybe PR is None (N) because the attacker can run it locally. But maybe the app needs to be installed, which might require some privileges. Wait, but the problem is about leaking information, so maybe the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The attack is possible without user interaction, like a local app that can access data. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the attack affects a different component. Since the issue is about leaking user information, which is within the same component (the application), the scope is Unchanged (U). Unless the attack can affect other components, but the description doesn't mention that. So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The issue is about leaking sensitive information, so Confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The description doesn't mention any modification of data, so Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): No mention of denial of service or availability issues, so Availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Wait, but the example given in the problem has C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"leak sensitive user information\" which affects confidentiality. But what about integrity and availability? The description doesn't mention any changes to data (integrity) or denial of service (availability). So I and A should be N. But maybe the user is confused. Let me check the example again. The example given in the problem's final line is C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. The actual answer depends on the CVE description.\n\nSo in this case, the CVE is about leaking information, so C is High. I and A are not mentioned, so they are None. So the vector would be AV:L, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. But wait, maybe the attack could affect other components. Wait, the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope. So the answer should be as above.\n\nWait, but sometimes, if the attack can be used to access other components, the scope might be Changed (C). But the description doesn't mention that. So S:U.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But I need to make sure each metric is correct. Let me double-check each one.\n\nAttack Vector: Local (L) because the malicious app is on the same system. Attack Complexity: Low (L) because the attack doesn't require complex steps. Privileges Required: None (N) because the attacker can run the app locally. User Interaction: None (N) because the attack doesn't need user interaction. Scope: Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't affect other components. Confidentiality: High (H) because sensitive info is leaked. Integrity and Availability: None (N) because no data modification or denial of service.

We hold ieee->beacon_lock in position (1) of thread 1 and use del_timer_sync() to wait timer to stop, but timer handler also need ieee->beacon_lock in position (2) of thread 2. As a result, ieee80211_beacons_stop() will block forever. This patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of spin_lock_irqsave(), which could let timer handler to obtain the needed lock.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a deadlock in the Linux kernel's ieee80211_beacons_stop() function. I need to determine the base metrics and calculate the base score.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each metric one by one. \n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is a system-level component. The deadlock occurs between threads, so the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to have local access to the system. But wait, the description mentions threads, which are part of the same process. So maybe it's Local. But sometimes, if the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, it might be Network. However, the example here is a deadlock between threads, which is a local issue. So AV: Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability requires the attacker to have two threads (Thread 1 and Thread 2) that are interacting in a specific way. The complexity here is high because the attacker needs to create a specific scenario where both threads are involved. So AC: High (H).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have some level of privilege. However, the patch is about a deadlock in the beacon handling, which might be accessible to a local user. But the description doesn't specify if it's a privilege escalation. Since the issue is a deadlock, maybe the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges. Wait, but the kernel is a privileged area. If the attacker is local, they might already have privileges. So PR: None (N) because the attacker can exploit it without needing additional privileges beyond what's already present (like local access).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The deadlock occurs without any user interaction. The threads are running as part of the system, so UI: None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the issue is within the same component (the kernel's beacon handling), the scope is Unchanged (U). So S: U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability causes a deadlock, which could lead to denial of service, but does it affect confidentiality? If the deadlock prevents the system from functioning, maybe it's not about confidentiality. However, the description doesn't mention data exposure. So C: None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the integrity isn't directly affected. The issue is a deadlock, which is more about availability. So I: None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The deadlock causes the system to block forever, leading to a denial of service. So A: High (H).\n\nNow, putting it all together. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Wait, but the example in the problem had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says the vulnerability is a deadlock in ieee80211_beacons_stop(). The patch fixes a deadlock, which is a race condition. The impact is that the system can't proceed, leading to a denial of service. So Availability is High. But what about confidentiality and integrity? The description doesn't mention any data being exposed or modified. So C and I are None. But sometimes, if the system is down, it's considered a high impact on availability. So the base score would be AV:L, AC:H, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. \n\nBut wait, the example given in the problem's final line example has C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. The actual answer depends on the specific impact. Since the vulnerability is a deadlock, which is a denial of service, the availability is high. Confidentiality and integrity are not affected. So the correct vector would be AV:L, AC:H, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. \n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the CVSS definitions again. For example, if the vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a denial of service, that's a high impact on availability. So A:H. The other metrics are as above.

The actual answer depends on the specific CVE. In this case, the CVE is about a deadlock, which is a denial of service, so A:H. C and I are not affected.

The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in the Order Attachments for WooCommerce plugin. The issue is that unauthenticated attackers can access sensitive data in the uploads directory.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to access the uploads directory. Since the attacker doesn't need to be authenticated and can access it from the network, AV should be Network (N). \n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC).

The user provided a CVE description about a SQL Injection vulnerability in the Tainacan plugin for WordPress. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the 'collection_id' parameter. Since the parameter is part of a web request, the attack vector is Network (N). Attackers can exploit this remotely over the network, so AV:N makes sense.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions that the vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping and lack of preparation on the SQL query. This suggests that the attack doesn't require complex steps. The attacker can just send a malicious parameter, so Attack Complexity is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The CVE says authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access can exploit this. So, the attacker needs to be authenticated, which is a Low (L) privilege requirement. But wait, the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a Low (L) because it's not requiring root or admin access. So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description doesn't mention any need for user interaction. The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any user action, so UI:N.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability allows extracting sensitive information, which affects confidentiality. However, the scope is whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the attack is on the same component (the database), the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the attack can lead to other impacts, maybe it's Changed. Wait, the scope is about whether the attack affects a different component. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to access other parts of the system, then scope is Changed.

The vulnerability allows extracting sensitive information, so that's High (H) for confidentiality.\n\nIntegrity (I). The description doesn't mention any modification of data, so Integrity is None (N). Wait, but maybe the attacker can modify data? The CVE says \"append additional SQL queries into existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information.\" So it's about reading data, not modifying. So I:N.\n\nAvailability (A).

Fix the validation avoiding the addition.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a Linux kernel vulnerability related to firmware handling. The main issue is an integer overflow in the validation of the number of returned protocols when using the BASE_DISCOVER_LIST_PROTOCOLS. The fix involves avoiding the addition that could cause an overflow.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is a system-level component. If an attacker can exploit this, they might need to be in a local context, like a user with local access. But wait, the description mentions that the vulnerability is in the firmware handling. If the SCMI platform is accessible via a network, maybe it's a network attack. But the problem is in the kernel's handling of firmware, which is typically local. Hmm. The SCMI (System Control and Management Interface) is used for communication between the CPU and other components, so maybe it's a local attack. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the firmware handling, which is part of the kernel. If an attacker can access the system locally, they could exploit this. So AV would be Local (L). But wait, if the SCMI is exposed over a network, maybe it's Network (N). The description doesn't specify, but the fix is in the kernel's code, so maybe it's local. I'll go with Local (L) for AV.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires the attacker to have access to the system and to trigger the protocol enumeration. The issue is with the integer overflow check. The fix is to avoid the addition that causes overflow. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to have any special skills beyond triggering the enumeration. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have local access to the system, but the vulnerability is in the kernel, so maybe they need to be a local user. However, if the vulnerability is in a system call that requires root privileges, then PR would be High. But the description doesn't mention that. The problem is in the firmware handling, which might be accessible to any user. Wait, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so if an attacker can access the system, they might have local privileges. But the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be a local user with no privileges, then PR is None (N). But if the exploit requires root access, then PR is High. The description doesn't specify, but since it's a kernel vulnerability, maybe it's possible that the attacker needs to be a local user with some privileges. However, the problem is in the enumeration process, which might be accessible to any user. I think PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges to exploit it. Wait, but if the vulnerability is in the kernel, maybe the attacker needs to be a local user. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without needing any specific privileges, then PR is N. So I'll go with PR: None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is in the enumeration process. If the attacker can trigger the enumeration without any user interaction, then UI is None (N). The description doesn't mention any need for user interaction, so UI is N.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel's firmware handling, and the fix is to prevent an overflow, the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope. The vulnerability affects the same component (kernel) and doesn't allow elevation of privileges. So S: U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass the check, leading to potential information disclosure. If the overflow allows the attacker to access more protocols, maybe they can read more data. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): If the overflow allows the attacker to modify the protocol list, then I could be High. But the description mentions that the check is bypassed, which might allow unauthorized access to protocols, but not necessarily modification. However, the exact impact isn't clear. The problem is in the validation, so maybe the integrity isn't directly affected. But since the check is bypassed, maybe the attacker can manipulate the protocol list, leading to potential integrity issues. However, the description doesn't specify that. I'll assume that the integrity is not directly affected, so I: N. Wait, but the problem is in the validation, which could allow unauthorized access to protocols. If the attacker can access more protocols, maybe they can read or write data, which would affect confidentiality and integrity. But the description doesn't specify. Since the problem is about the number of protocols being validated, maybe the integrity isn't directly affected. So I: N. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the overflow allows the attacker to manipulate the protocol list, then I could be High. But without more info, I'll go with I: N.\n\nAvailability (A): The overflow could lead to a denial of service if the check is bypassed, causing the system to crash or behave incorrectly. So A is High (H).\n\nWait, but the description says the check is bypassed, which could lead to incorrect behavior. If the system crashes or becomes unstable, that's an availability issue. So A: H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: High (H)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I might be High. Let me check again. The vulnerability is in the validation of the number of protocols. If the check is bypassed, the attacker could potentially access more protocols, which might allow them to read or write data, affecting confidentiality and integrity. However, the description doesn't specify that. Since the problem is about the number of protocols, maybe the integrity isn't directly affected. So I: N. But if the attacker can access more protocols, maybe they can modify the system's behavior, leading to integrity issues. But without explicit info, it's safer to assume that the integrity isn't directly affected. So I: N.\n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H. Wait, but the answer example has C:H, I:H, A:H. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nThe problem is that the check is bypassed, which could allow the attacker to access more protocols. If the protocols are related to system functions, this could lead to unauthorized access to system resources, which would affect confidentiality (C:H). For integrity, if the attacker can modify the protocol list, then I:H. But the description says the check is bypassed, not that the list is modified. So maybe I is N. Availability could be H if the system crashes. So the answer would be C:H, I:N, A:H. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the vulnerability allows the attacker to bypass the check, leading to potential data exposure (C:H) and possibly denial of service (A:H). So the final vector would be AV:L, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:H. But I'm not 100% certain about I. Maybe the answer expects I:H. Let me check the original description again. The vulnerability is in the validation of the number of returned protocols. If the check is bypassed, the attacker could get more protocols, which might allow them to access more data (C:H) or modify the system's behavior (I:H). But without explicit info, it's safer to assume that the integrity isn't directly affected. So I:N. Therefore, the vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 2.2, "success": true}

Such deadlock can happen in the following situation. When all journal buckets are fully filled by active jset with heavy write I/O load, the cache set registration (after a reboot) will load all active jsets and inserting them into the btree again (which is called journal replay). If a journaled bkey is inserted into a btree node and results btree node split, new journal request might be triggered. For example, the btree grows one more level after the node split, then the root node record in cache device super block will be upgrade by bch_journal_meta() from bch_btree_set_root(). But there is no space in journal buckets, the journal replay has to wait for new journal bucket to be reclaimed after at least one journal bucket replayed. This is one example that how the journal no-space deadlock happens. The solution to avoid the deadlock is to reserve 1 journal bucket in run time, and only permit the reserved journal bucket to be used during cache set registration procedure for things like journal replay. Then the journal space will never be fully filled, there is no chance for journal no-space deadlock to happen anymore. This patch adds a new member \"bool do_reserve\" in struct journal, it is inititalized to 0 (false) when struct journal is allocated, and set to 1 (true) by bch_journal_space_reserve() when all initialization done in run_cache_set(). In the run time when journal_reclaim() tries to allocate a new journal bucket, free_journal_buckets() is called to check whether there are enough free journal buckets to use. If there is only 1 free journal bucket and journal->do_reserve is 1 (true), the last bucket is reserved and free_journal_buckets() will return 0 to indicate no free journal bucket. Then journal_reclaim() will give up, and try next time to see whetheer there is free journal bucket to allocate. By this method, there is always 1 jouranl bucket reserved in run time. During the cache set registration, journal->do_reserve is 0 (false), so the reserved journal bucket can be used to avoid the no-space deadlock.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the bcache module. The issue is a deadlock caused by the journal no-space problem during cache set registration. The fix involves reserving one journal bucket to prevent this deadlock.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is a system-level component. The attack vector here is likely Local (L) because the attacker would need to have local access to the system. However, if the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, it might be Network (N). But the description mentions that the problem occurs during cache set registration, which is a local process. So AV is probably Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity here is High (H) because the attacker would need to have a specific setup, like heavy write I/O load, and the exact conditions to trigger the deadlock. It's not a simple exploit, so AC is High.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have local access, but the description doesn't mention needing elevated privileges. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, maybe the attacker needs to be a local user with some privileges. However, the patch is about reserving a bucket during registration, which might not require high privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already in the system, maybe PR is Low (L) because they can exploit it without needing root. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the kernel, so maybe the attacker needs to have local access, but the PR is Low because they don't need to be root. Or maybe it's None (N) if any local user can exploit it. Hmm. The description says the problem occurs during cache set registration, which is part of the system's operation. So maybe the attacker needs to be a local user, so PR is Low (L) because they don't need to have elevated privileges beyond being a local user. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already a local user, then PR is Low. So I'll go with PR: Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The deadlock happens during a specific process, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel) and doesn't allow elevation of privilege. The problem is within the kernel's own processes, so the scope doesn't change. So S: Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a deadlock, which might lead to denial of service, but does it affect confidentiality? The description says the issue is about journal space and deadlock, not data leakage. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the issue is about preventing a deadlock, not about modifying data. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The deadlock can cause the system to hang or not respond, which affects availability. So A is High (H).\n\nWait, but the problem is a deadlock, which is a denial of service. So the availability impact is High. So A: High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: High (H)\nPR: Low (L)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but I need to check again. Let me verify each metric again.\n\nAttack Vector: The vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be on the same system. If it's a remote exploit, it would be Network (N), but the description doesn't mention that. So AV:L.\n\nAttack Complexity: The complexity is High because the attacker needs to have specific conditions (heavy write I/O, cache set registration) to trigger the deadlock. So AC:H.\n\nPrivileges Required: The attacker needs to be a local user, but the patch is about reserving a bucket during registration. Since the attacker is already in the system, PR is Low (L). If the attacker needs to be root, then PR would be High, but the description doesn't indicate that. So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction: None, as the process is automated. UI:N.\n\nScope: Unchanged, because the vulnerability doesn't allow elevation of privilege. S:U.\n\nConfidentiality: No data is leaked, so C:N.\n\nIntegrity: No data modification, so I:N.\n\nAvailability: The deadlock can cause the system to be unresponsive, so A:H.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

According to Documentation/admin-guide/mm/numaperf.rst: \"Some memory may share the same node as a CPU, and others are provided as memory only nodes.\" Therefore, some node CPU masks may be empty and wouldn't have a \"first CPU\". On a machine with far memory (and therefore CPU-less NUMA nodes): - cpumask_of_node(nid) is 0 - cpumask_first(0) is CONFIG_NR_CPUS - cpu_data(CONFIG_NR_CPUS) accesses the cpu_info per-CPU array at an index that is 1 out of bounds This does not have any security implications since flashing microcode is a privileged operation but I believe this has reliability implications by potentially corrupting memory while flashing a microcode update. When booting with CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS=y on an AMD machine that flashes a microcode update. I get the following splat: UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/microcode/amd.c:X:Y index 512 is out of range for type 'unsigned long[512]' [...] Call Trace: dump_stack __ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds load_microcode_amd request_microcode_amd reload_store kernfs_fop_write_iter vfs_write ksys_write do_syscall_64 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe Change the loop to go over only NUMA nodes which have CPUs before determining whether the first CPU on the respective node needs microcode update. [ bp: Massage commit message, fix typo. ]\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's handling of microcode updates for AMD CPUs. The issue arises when the code iterates over all NUMA nodes and accesses per-CPU data for the first CPU of each node's CPU mask. However, some NUMA nodes might not have any CPUs (CPU-less nodes), leading to an out-of-bounds access when trying to access the first CPU of an empty mask. The problem is that this access is out of bounds, which could potentially corrupt memory during a microcode update. The description mentions that while there's no direct security implication (since flashing microcode is privileged), there are reliability issues.\n\nNow, I need to map this to the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. Let's go through each metric one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is triggered when the system has CPU-less NUMA nodes. The code accesses per-CPU data, which is typically local to the CPU. However, the out-of-bounds access is due to incorrect handling of the CPU mask. Since the attack is related to the system's internal state (NUMA nodes and CPU masks), the attack vector is likely Local (L). Wait, but the code is part of the kernel, so an attacker would need local access to exploit this. However, the description says that the issue is a reliability problem, not a security one. But the CVSS metrics are about the potential impact, not the actual security impact. So even if it's a reliability issue, the attack vector would still be Local because the attacker needs to be on the same system. So AV: Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability requires the attacker to have a system with CPU-less NUMA nodes. The code's logic is flawed, but the complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any special steps beyond the system configuration. The out-of-bounds access is a result of the code's logic, so the complexity is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The problem is that the microcode flashing is a privileged operation. However, the out-of-bounds access is a reliability issue. But the CVSS PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. Since the code is part of the kernel, an attacker would need to have some level of access. However, the description says that the issue doesn't have security implications, but the out-of-bounds access could be triggered by any process that calls the microcode update function. But since the microcode flashing is a privileged operation, the attacker would need to have elevated privileges. Wait, but the problem is that the code is accessing per-CPU data, which is local. So maybe the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges, but the code is part of the kernel, so the attack is local. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds access without needing elevated privileges, then PR would be None (N). But the microcode flashing is a privileged operation, so maybe the attacker needs to have some privileges. Hmm. The description says that the issue doesn't have security implications, but the out-of-bounds access could be triggered by any process that calls the microcode update function. However, the microcode update is a privileged operation, so the attacker would need to have the necessary privileges to call that function. Therefore, PR would be High (H) because the attacker needs to have elevated privileges to trigger the microcode update. Wait, but the problem is that the code is accessing per-CPU data, which is local. So maybe the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges, but the code is part of the kernel, so the attack is local. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without needing any privileges, then PR is None. But the microcode flashing is a privileged operation, so the attacker would need to have the necessary privileges to call that function. Therefore, PR is High (H). Wait, but the vulnerability is in the code that's part of the kernel, so even if the attacker is local, they might not need elevated privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is local, they can exploit it without needing any additional privileges. So PR would be None (N). But the microcode flashing is a privileged operation, so maybe the attacker needs to have the necessary privileges to call that function. However, the vulnerability is in the code that's part of the kernel, so the attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds access by calling the microcode update function, which requires elevated privileges. Therefore, PR is High (H). Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the code that's part of the kernel. The attacker needs to be able to trigger the microcode update, which is a privileged operation. Therefore, the attacker would need to have elevated privileges (like root) to call that function. So PR is High (H). But the description says that the issue doesn't have security implications, but the out-of-bounds access could be triggered by any process that calls the microcode update function. So if the attacker can call that function, they need to have the necessary privileges. Therefore, PR is High (H). But maybe the attacker doesn't need to have elevated privileges because the code is part of the kernel, and the attacker is local. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is local, they can exploit it without needing any additional privileges. So PR would be None (N). But the microcode update is a privileged operation, so the attacker would need to have the necessary privileges to call that function. Therefore, PR is High (H). I think the correct answer here is PR: High (H) because the attacker needs to have the privileges to call the microcode update function, which is a privileged operation. So PR is High.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability can be triggered by the system's configuration (CPU-less NUMA nodes) and the microcode update process. The description doesn't mention any user interaction required, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The description says that the issue is a reliability problem, not a security one. However, the out-of-bounds access could affect the system's reliability, but the scope is about whether the impact is on the same component or a different one. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel's microcode handling, and the impact is on the same component (the kernel's memory), the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but the out-of-bounds access could lead to memory corruption, which might affect other components. However, the CVSS scope is about whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. If the vulnerability's impact is on the same component (like the kernel's memory), then the scope is Unchanged (U). But if the attacker can exploit it to gain higher privileges or affect other components, then the scope is Changed (C). However, the description says that the issue doesn't have security implications, so the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability is a reliability issue, not a security one. So the confidentiality impact is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the issue is a reliability problem, so the integrity impact is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The out-of-bounds access could potentially corrupt memory, leading to system instability or crashes. This would affect availability. So the availability impact is High (H).\n\nWait, but the description says that the issue doesn't have security implications, but the reliability implications could lead to memory corruption. So for CVSS, the impact metrics are based on the potential impact, not the actual impact. So even if it's a reliability issue, the availability impact would be High (H) because the system could crash or become unstable. Therefore, A: High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: High (H)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nWait, but earlier I thought PR might be None. Let me double-check. The PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is local, they can exploit it without needing any additional privileges. But the microcode update is a privileged operation. So the attacker needs to have the privileges to call the microcode update function. Therefore, PR is High (H). But if the attacker is local, they can exploit it without needing any privileges, because the code is part of the kernel. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is local, they can exploit it without needing any additional privileges. So PR is None (N). But the microcode update is a privileged operation, so the attacker needs to have the necessary privileges to call that function. Therefore, PR is High (H). This is conflicting. Let me check the CVSS definitions. \n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability can be exploited by a local user without any additional privileges, then PR is None (N). If the attacker needs to have some level of privilege (like root), then PR is High (H). In this case, the attacker needs to be able to trigger the microcode update, which is a privileged operation.

While reading sysctl_icmp_echo_enable_probe, it can be changed concurrently. Thus, we need to add READ_ONCE() to its readers.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring problem. The user provided a CVE description about a data race in the Linux kernel related to sysctl_icmp_echo_enable_probe. I need to figure out the base metrics and calculate the base score.\n\nFirst, I'll recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The metrics are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, specifically in a sysctl variable. Sysctl variables are typically accessed via the kernel's sysctl interface, which is a system call. So, an attacker would need to have local access to the system to exploit this. Wait, but the description mentions that the variable can be changed concurrently while being read. So, the data race is between a read and a write. But how does that affect the attack vector?\n\nWait, the vulnerability is a data race around sysctl_icmp_echo_enable_probe. The problem is that when reading this sysctl variable, it can be changed concurrently. So, the issue is that the read and write operations are not synchronized, leading to a race condition. This could allow a local attacker to modify the value while it's being read, leading to potential issues. But since sysctl variables are usually accessed via the kernel's sysctl interface, which is a local interface, the attack vector would be Local (L). Because the attacker needs to be on the same system to exploit this. So AV is Local (L).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The data race requires that the attacker can both read and write the sysctl variable at the same time. However, the vulnerability is that the read is not protected, so the attacker can trigger the race by reading and writing concurrently. But the complexity here is that the attacker needs to have the ability to both read and write the variable. However, since the sysctl variable is a kernel parameter, the attacker would need to have local access to perform these operations. The complexity is considered Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to have any special tools or steps beyond the basic ability to access the sysctl interface. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to have local access to the system. Since the sysctl interface is typically accessible to users with sufficient privileges, but the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attacker would need to be a local user. However, the question is whether the attacker needs to have any privileges. If the sysctl variable is accessible to any user, then PR would be None (N). But if the variable is protected and requires root privileges, then PR would be High (H). Wait, the description doesn't specify. But in general, sysctl variables can be accessed by users with the appropriate permissions. However, the vulnerability is about a data race, not about privilege escalation. So the attacker would need to be a local user with the ability to read and write the sysctl variable. If the variable is accessible without any privileges, then PR is None (N). But if it's protected, then PR would be High. However, the CVE description doesn't mention that. Since the problem is about a data race, not about privilege escalation, I think PR is None (N) because the attacker can exploit it without needing elevated privileges beyond local access. Wait, but the sysctl interface might require root access. For example, some sysctl variables are only accessible to root. If the variable in question is accessible to any user, then PR is N. If it's only accessible to root, then PR would be High (H). But the description doesn't specify. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. However, in the absence of specific information, I might assume that the sysctl variable is accessible to local users, so PR is None (N). But I need to be careful here. Alternatively, maybe the attacker needs to have some privileges to modify the sysctl variable. If the variable is protected, then PR would be High. But without more info, I think the safest assumption is that the attacker needs to be a local user, so PR is None (N). Wait, but the CVSS PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be a local user with no special privileges (i.e., any local user), then PR is None (N). If the attacker needs to have root privileges, then PR is High (H). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and sysctl variables are typically accessible to root, but maybe the variable in question is accessible to any user. However, the CVE description doesn't specify. This is a bit of a problem. Maybe I should look for similar vulnerabilities. For example, a data race in a sysctl variable that's accessible to any user would have PR:N. If it's only accessible to root, then PR:H. But without knowing, perhaps the default is to assume that the variable is accessible to any user, so PR:N. Alternatively, maybe the attacker needs to have local access, which is considered as PR:N. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be a local user (i.e., have local access), then PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to have any specific privileges beyond being on the system. Wait, no. The PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. For example, if the vulnerability requires the attacker to have root privileges, then PR is High. If the attacker can exploit it as a regular user, then PR is None. So, if the sysctl variable is accessible to any user, then PR is None. If it's only accessible to root, then PR is High. Since the CVE is about a data race in the sysctl variable, which is a kernel parameter, I think that the variable is accessible to users with the appropriate permissions. But without specific info, perhaps the default is to assume that the variable is accessible to any user, so PR:N. However, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check the CVSS guidelines. According to CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability can be exploited by a local user without any additional privileges, then PR is None. If it requires root, then PR is High. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and sysctl variables are typically accessible to root, but maybe the variable in question is accessible to any user. This is a bit of a guess. However, given that the vulnerability is a data race, which is a concurrency issue, the attacker would need to have local access to trigger the race. So PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to have any specific privileges beyond being a local user. So I'll go with PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is a data race, which can be exploited without any user interaction. The attacker can trigger the race by reading and writing the sysctl variable. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The scope refers to whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the data race is within the same component (the kernel), the scope is Unchanged (U). So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The data race could lead to information leakage if the variable is being read and modified concurrently. However, the specific impact here is not clear. The CVE description mentions that the variable is sysctl_icmp_echo_enable_probe, which is a boolean flag. If the data race allows an attacker to modify the value while it's being read, it could lead to incorrect behavior, but not necessarily confidentiality issues. However, if the variable is a sensitive value, then confidentiality could be affected. But the description doesn't specify. Since the problem is about a data race, the impact on confidentiality might be Low (L) if the variable is not sensitive. Alternatively, if the variable's value is used in a way that could expose sensitive information, then C could be High. But without more info, I think the default is to assume that the confidentiality impact is Low (L). However, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the data race could allow an attacker to read data that shouldn't be accessible. But the variable is a boolean, so maybe not. So I'll go with C:L.\n\nIntegrity (I). The data race could allow an attacker to modify the variable while it's being read, leading to incorrect values. This could affect the integrity of the system's state. For example, if the variable controls a feature, changing it during a read could lead to unexpected behavior. So the integrity impact is High (H). Because the attacker can modify the variable, which is part of the system's state, leading to potential integrity issues.\n\nAvailability (A). The data race could lead to a denial of service if the variable is used in a way that causes the system to crash or behave incorrectly. However, the description doesn't mention availability issues. So the availability impact is None (N) unless the data race leads to a crash. But since the CVE is about a data race, it's possible that the impact on availability is Low (L) if the system can still function, or High (H) if it causes a crash. But without specific info, I think the default is to assume that the availability impact is None (N). However, data races can sometimes lead to crashes, so maybe A:L. But the description doesn't mention that. So I'll go with A:N.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the variable is being read and written concurrently. If the variable is a flag that controls some functionality, like enabling or disabling ICMP echo requests, then a data race could lead to the system not functioning as intended.

The user provided a CVE description about a stored XSS vulnerability in modelscope/agentscope. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means the attacker needs to have the user visit a malicious link or page. Since the user is interacting with the application, the attack vector is likely Network (N) because the attacker can exploit this through the network, like a malicious link. Wait, but stored XSS can be triggered when the user visits a page that has the malicious payload already stored. So the attacker might not need to be on the same network, but the user has to click on a link. So AV:N makes sense here.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is Low (L) or High (H). For XSS, the complexity is usually low because the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps. The payload is just inserted into the HTML, so the complexity is low. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any special privileges. They just need to inject the script, which can be done by any user. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is Required (R) or None (N). Since the user has to click on a malicious link or interact with the page that contains the XSS payload, there's some user interaction. Wait, but in stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact beyond visiting the page. The attacker might have already injected the payload, and the user just needs to visit the page. So maybe UI:N? Wait, the description says the user-controllable string (run ID) is appended and rendered as HTML. So the attacker can inject the XSS payload into the run ID, which is then rendered. So the user doesn't need to interact beyond visiting the page. So UI:N? Or is there a need for the user to click on a link? Hmm. The user might have to click on a link that contains the malicious run ID. So maybe UI:N because the user doesn't need to interact beyond visiting the page. Wait, but the user might have to click on a link that's part of the application. So maybe UI:N is correct here. Wait, the CVSS UI metric is whether user interaction is required. For stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact beyond visiting the page. So UI:N. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. If the attacker injects the payload into the run ID, and the user visits the page that displays that run ID, then the user doesn't need to do anything else. So UI:N. So PR:N, UI:N.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) or Changed (C). Since the vulnerability affects the same component (the application's own data), the scope is unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is High (H) because the attacker can steal user data via JavaScript. Integrity (I) is High (H) because the attacker can modify the page's content. Availability (A) is None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't directly affect availability. Wait, but if the attacker can execute arbitrary JS, could that lead to denial of service?

The vulnerability is via the 'post' parameter, which is likely a user input parameter. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated (Subscriber-level access), but the attack is through a parameter that's part of the application's input, I think AV is Network (N) or Local (L). Wait, the description says \"authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access\". So the attack vector is through the network, but the attacker needs to be authenticated. Wait, but in CVSS, AV is about how the attack is delivered. If the parameter is part of a request, like a URL parameter or form input, then AV is Network (N) because it's over the network. But if it's a local file or something, it's Local. But since it's a web parameter, AV is Network. But wait, the user is authenticated, so maybe it's Local? Hmm. Wait, the attack vector is how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, does that affect AV? No, AV is about the path to the vulnerability. If the parameter is in a request, it's Network. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability requires the attacker to have Subscriber-level access. But the complexity here is about how hard it is to exploit. The description says \"insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query\". So the attacker can append SQL queries, which is a low complexity because they just need to input the parameter correctly. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be authenticated with Subscriber-level access. So PR is Low (L) because it's not requiring root or admin privileges, just a user with Subscriber access. Wait, but the question says \"authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above\". So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some level of access, but not the highest. So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The attacker can exploit it without needing the user to do anything. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows extracting sensitive information from the database. Since the attack affects the same component (the database), the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the attacker can access other components, then it's Changed (C). But the description says \"extract sensitive information from the database\", which is part of the same scope. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can extract sensitive information, so C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The description doesn't mention modifying data, so I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability is SQL Injection, which could lead to data loss or denial of service, but the description doesn't specify. However, since the main issue is extracting data, maybe A is None (N). But sometimes SQL Injection can lead to DoS, but the description doesn't mention that. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Wait, but the user's example had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nThe description says \"extract sensitive information from the database\" which is Confidentiality (C:H). Integrity (I) is not mentioned, so I:N. Availability (A) is not mentioned, so A:N. So the vector is as above. But maybe the attacker could also modify data? The description doesn't say that. So I:N and A:N. So the final answer should be that.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

This affects the function test of the file coreframe/app/search/admin/config.php. The manipulation of the argument sphinxhost/sphinxport leads to server-side request forgery. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in wuzhicms 4.1.0, specifically in the test function of coreframe/app/search/admin/config.php. The issue is that manipulating the sphinxhost/sphinxport arguments leads to server-side request forgery (SSRF). The attack can be initiated remotely, and the exploit is public.\n\nAlright, starting with the base metrics. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The description says the attack can be initiated remotely. That means the attacker doesn't need to be physically present or have local access. So, AV should be Network (N) because the attack is done over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description doesn't mention any specific complexity. Since SSRF often requires the attacker to craft specific input, but if it's a simple manipulation of parameters, the complexity might be Low (L). But I need to check if there's any indication of high complexity. Since the exploit is public and the attack is possible remotely, maybe it's low complexity. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability allows the attack to be initiated remotely, but does it require any user privileges? The description doesn't mention needing authentication. So PR is None (N) because no privileges are needed.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The exploit is public and can be used without needing user interaction. The description says \"it is possible to initiate the attack remotely,\" which implies that the attacker can do it without the user's interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope refers to whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the SSRF is a server-side issue, but the description doesn't mention that the attack escalates privileges or affects other components. So the scope is Unchanged (U), meaning the attack doesn't change the scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C): SSRF can potentially allow access to internal resources, which might lead to data exfiltration. So Confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker could access sensitive data.\n\nIntegrity (I): If the SSRF allows the attacker to modify internal resources, then Integrity could be High. But the description doesn't specify that. However, since it's a server-side request, maybe the attacker can manipulate the server's requests, which might affect integrity. But without explicit mention, maybe it's Low (L) or None (N). Wait, the problem says \"manipulation of the argument... leads to server-side request forgery.\" SSRF typically allows the attacker to make the server make requests to internal services. If the server is making requests to internal services, the attacker could potentially modify data or access internal systems. So maybe Integrity is High (H) because the attacker could alter data. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the vulnerability only allows reading data (like internal services), then C would be High, but I and A might be None. Hmm. The description doesn't specify, but since it's a SSRF, which can be used for various purposes, but the question is about the base metrics. The base metrics are about the impact. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to make the server request any internal resource, then the confidentiality could be high (exfiltrating data), integrity could be high (modifying data), and availability could be high (denial of service). But the description doesn't specify. However, the problem says \"manipulation of the argument... leads to server-side request forgery.\" So the main impact is that the server is making requests that the attacker can control. So, for example, if the server is making requests to internal services, the attacker could access internal data (C:H), modify data (I:H), or cause DoS (A:H). But without more info, maybe the default is to assume that all three are High. But I need to check the standard for SSRF. Typically, SSRF can lead to C:H, I:H, and A:H. But sometimes, depending on the scenario. However, the problem says the exploit is public and may be used. So the base metrics would be C:H, I:H, A:H. But I need to be careful. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the test function, so maybe the attacker can make the server make requests to internal services. If the server is making requests to internal services, then the attacker could access internal data (C:H), modify data (I:H), or cause the server to be unavailable (A:H). So all three are High. But maybe the original description doesn't specify, so I have to make an educated guess. Alternatively, maybe the impact is only on confidentiality. But I think in the absence of specific info, the standard approach is to assume that SSRF can lead to all three. So C:H, I:H, A:H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network)\nAC:L (Low)\nPR:N (None)\nUI:N (None)\nS:U (Unchanged)\nC:H (High)\nI:H (High)\nA:H (High)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\nWait, but I need to check if the scope is changed. The scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, then scope would be Changed (C). But in this case, the attack is SSRF, which is a server-side issue. If the attacker can make the server request internal services, but the scope is still the same (the server is the same component), then S:U. So that's correct.\n\nSo the final answer should be the vector string as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "score": 5.500000000000001, "success": true}

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of ServiceStack. Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation. The specific flaw exists within the implementation of the FindType method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25837.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a ServiceStack vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The description says it's a remote code execution vulnerability. The attacker can exploit this remotely, so AV should be Network (N). But wait, the description mentions that interaction with the library is required. Hmm, but the attack vector is still network-based because the attacker can send a request over the network. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The flaw is due to lack of validation of a user-supplied path. The attacker doesn't need to have any special privileges or complex steps. So AC is Low (L) because the attack doesn't require complex steps.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The description says the attacker can execute code in the context of the current process. That implies the attacker doesn't need any prior privileges. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The note says interaction with the library is required. But does that mean user interaction is needed? Wait, the vulnerability requires interaction with the library, but maybe that's part of the attack vector. The UI metric is about whether the user has to interact, like clicking a link. Since the attack is remote and the user might not need to interact beyond the initial request, UI:N. But the description says \"Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability\". Wait, maybe that's a red herring. The UI metric is about whether the user has to take action. If the attack is automated, then UI:N. So I think UI:N.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability affects a different component. The description says the flaw is in the FindType method, leading to code execution. Since the attack can lead to code execution, which is a different component (like system privileges), the scope is Changed (C). Wait, but the original component is the application, and the attack affects the system's availability or other components. So S:C.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows remote code execution, which could lead to data theft. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can execute code, which could modify data. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A). The attacker can execute code, which might lead to denial of service. So A:H.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:C, C:H, I:H, A:H. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H. Wait, but the user's example had S:U. Let me check again. The scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new vulnerability in a different component. Since the code execution could affect the system's availability, maybe the scope is Changed. But sometimes, if the attack is within the same component, it's Unchanged. Wait, the original component is the application, and the attack leads to code execution, which might be a different component. So S:C. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The scope is Changed if the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain system privileges, then the scope is Changed. In this case, the code execution could be in the context of the current process, which might be the same component. But if the process is running as a service with higher privileges, then the scope is Changed. The description says \"execute code in the context of the current process\", which might imply that the process has the same privileges as the application. So maybe the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but the original component is the application, and the attack could lead to compromising the system's availability, which is a different component. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. Scope is Changed if the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new vulnerability in a different component. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain access to a different component, then S:C. If the attack is within the same component, then S:U. In this case, the code execution is in the context of the current process. If the process is running as a service with higher privileges, then the attacker can affect other components. But the description doesn't specify. Since the user says \"execute code in the context of the current process\", maybe the scope is Unchanged. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the scope is Changed because the attack can lead to system-level access. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example had S:U. But in this case, the attack allows code execution, which could be a different component. So maybe S:C. But I'm not certain. Let me go with S:C for now. \n\nSo the final vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H. But I need to make sure. Let me check again. The original component is the application. If the attack allows the attacker to execute code, which could lead to modifying the application's data (integrity) or accessing data (confidentiality), but if the code execution is in the same process, then the scope is Unchanged. However, if the code execution can lead to compromising the system's availability, then the scope is Changed. Since the description says \"execute code in the context of the current process\", which might imply that the process has the same privileges as the application. Therefore, the scope is Unchanged (S:U). Wait, that makes more sense. Because the attack is within the same component. So S:U. Then the vector would be S:U. \n\nSo I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. The scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't affect a different component. The code execution is within the same process, so the scope remains the same. Therefore, S:U. \n\nSo the final vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. \n\nBut wait, the user's example had S:U. Let me check the original problem again. The example given in the problem's final line was Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. So that's the example. So in this case, the scope is Unchanged. Therefore, the correct answer is S:U. \n\nSo the correct vector is AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:H. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\n**Metric Justifications:**\n- **AV:N** - The vulnerability allows remote attackers to exploit the flaw over a network, as the attack vector is network-based.\n- **AC:L** - The attack requires no complex steps, as the flaw is a simple path validation issue.\n- **PR:N** - No prior privileges are needed; an attacker can exploit the vulnerability without authentication.\n- **UI:N** - No user interaction is required beyond the initial attack vector (e.g., sending a malicious request).\n- **S:U** - The scope is unchanged because the vulnerability affects the same component (application process) and does not escalate to a different component.\n- **C:H** - Confidentiality is compromised as attackers can execute code, potentially accessing sensitive data.\n- **I:H** - Integrity is compromised as attackers can modify files or data via arbitrary code execution.\n- **A:H** - Availability is compromised as attackers could cause denial-of-service or disrupt system operations.", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 1.700000000000001, "success": true}

While reading sysctl_tcp_early_retrans, it can be changed concurrently. Thus, we need to add READ_ONCE() to its reader.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring problem. The user provided a CVE description about a data race in the Linux kernel related to sysctl_tcp_early_retrans. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, I'll recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The ones mentioned are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, specifically in a sysctl variable. Sysctl is a system call that allows configuration of kernel parameters. Since this is a kernel-level issue, an attacker would need to have local access to exploit it. So AV should be Local (L), because the attacker has to be on the same system. But wait, sometimes sysctl can be accessed over a network if there's a vulnerability in the network stack. However, the description mentions a data race in a sysctl variable. The fix involves adding READ_ONCE() to prevent concurrent modification. So the vulnerability is about concurrent access, which is a race condition. But the attack vector here is local because the attacker needs to be on the same system to modify or read the sysctl variable. So AV is Local (L).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The data race requires that the attacker can read and write to the same variable concurrently. The complexity here is that the attacker needs to have both read and write access to the variable at the same time. However, the fix is adding READ_ONCE(), which is a low complexity change. But the original vulnerability's complexity is high because the attacker has to coordinate the read and write operations. Wait, the AC metric is about how complex it is for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have both read and write access, that's high complexity. But in this case, the vulnerability is a data race, which might be considered high complexity because the attacker has to time their actions. However, sometimes data races are considered low complexity if the attacker can exploit them without much coordination. Hmm. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The original problem is that the variable can be changed concurrently while being read. So the attacker would need to have both read and write access. But since it's a sysctl variable, which is typically accessed via local system calls, the attacker would need to be local. So the attack complexity is high because the attacker has to perform both read and write operations at the same time. Therefore, AC is High (H). Wait, but some sources say that data races are considered high complexity. So I'll go with AC: High (H).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have local access. But does the attacker need to have any privileges? Since sysctl variables are usually accessible to users with certain permissions, but the vulnerability is about a data race. If the attacker is local, they might already have the necessary privileges. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is local, they might not need any additional privileges beyond being logged in. So PR is None (N). Wait, but maybe the attacker needs to have some privileges to modify the sysctl variable. However, the description doesn't mention that. The fix is adding READ_ONCE() to prevent concurrent modification. So the attacker would need to be able to read and write the variable, which is possible with local access. So PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to have elevated privileges beyond being local. So PR: None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is a data race. Does it require user interaction? The description doesn't mention any. The attacker can exploit it without needing user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges or access to other components. Since this is a data race in a sysctl variable, which is a kernel parameter, the scope is unchanged. The attacker can't elevate privileges beyond what they already have. So S: Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C). The data race could allow an attacker to read data that shouldn't be accessible. However, the specific variable in question is sysctl_tcp_early_retrans, which is a configuration parameter. If the attacker can modify it, they might affect the system's behavior, but not necessarily disclose confidential information. However, if the data race allows the attacker to read the variable when it's being modified, maybe they can get some information. But the description doesn't specify that. So maybe C is None (N). Wait, but the vulnerability is a data race, which could lead to inconsistent data. However, the CVSS scoring for confidentiality is about whether the vulnerability allows unauthorized disclosure of information. If the variable is a configuration parameter, maybe it's not confidential. So C: None (N). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the data race allows the attacker to read the variable when it's being modified, maybe they can get some information. But without more details, it's safer to assume that confidentiality is not affected. So C: None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I). The data race allows the attacker to modify the sysctl variable while it's being read. This could lead to the system using incorrect values, which affects the integrity of the system's configuration. So the attacker can alter the system's behavior, which is a high integrity impact. So I: High (H).\n\nAvailability (A). The data race could cause the system to behave incorrectly, leading to potential denial of service. For example, if the sysctl variable is used in a critical part of the network stack, incorrect values could cause the system to drop packets or crash. So the availability impact is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: High (H)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: High (H)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the confidentiality. Let me check again. The sysctl_tcp_early_retrans is a configuration parameter. If the attacker can modify it, they might change the behavior of the TCP stack. But confidentiality is about data being disclosed. If the variable is a configuration parameter, maybe it's not considered confidential. So C is None. But if the data race allows the attacker to read the variable when it's being modified, maybe they can get some information. However, without specific details, it's safer to assume that confidentiality is not affected. So C: N.\n\nBut maybe the data race could allow the attacker to read the variable when it's being modified, leading to potential information leakage. For example, if the variable is a flag that's being set, the attacker could read it during the modification and get a value that's not intended. However, this is speculative. The CVE description doesn't mention confidentiality impact, so I think C is None.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

Successful exploitation could allow an authenticated low privilege operator user to change the state of certain settings of a vulnerable system.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a privilege escalation vulnerability in HPE Aruba Networking Fabric Composer. The goal is to determine each base metric and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The metrics are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the web-based management interface. Since the attack is through the web interface, which is network-based, AV should be Network (N). But wait, sometimes if it's a local exploit, it's Local (L). But the description says it's a web-based interface, so the attacker would need to access the network. So AV:N makes sense.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions that the user is authenticated and has low privileges. The complexity here is whether the attack requires multiple steps. Since it's a privilege escalation, maybe the complexity is low because the attacker can exploit it with minimal steps once authenticated. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user is already authenticated and has low privileges. The vulnerability allows them to change settings, so the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges. So PR:N. Wait, but the user is authenticated. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, does that affect PR? Wait, PR is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already authenticated, then maybe PR is Low (L) because they need to have some privileges. Wait, the description says \"authenticated low privilege operator user\". So the user already has low privileges, but the vulnerability allows them to escalate. So the PR would be Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some level of access (authenticated) to exploit it. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already authenticated, does that count as PR:N? Or is PR about the privileges needed to exploit, not the authentication? Hmm. Let me check. The PR metric is \"the level of privileges an attacker must have before successfully exploiting the vulnerability.\" So if the attacker is already authenticated, that's part of the exploit. But the PR is about the privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, but the vulnerability allows them to escalate, then maybe PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some privileges (like being authenticated) to exploit it. Wait, but the PR options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, but the vulnerability allows them to escalate, then the PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some level of access (authenticated) to exploit it. Alternatively, maybe PR is N because the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges beyond being authenticated. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already authenticated, then maybe that's considered as having some privileges. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit. So if the attacker needs to be authenticated, but the vulnerability allows them to escalate, then the PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some privileges (like being authenticated) to exploit it. Alternatively, maybe PR is N because the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges beyond being authenticated. Wait, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker is already authenticated, that's part of the exploit. But the PR is about the privileges required to exploit. So if the attacker needs to be authenticated, but the vulnerability allows them to escalate, then the PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some level of access (authenticated) to exploit it. So I think PR is Low (L) here. Wait, but the description says \"authenticated low privilege operator user\". So the user is already authenticated and has low privileges. The vulnerability allows them to escalate. So the PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have low privileges (already authenticated) to exploit it. So PR:L. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit. If the attacker is already authenticated, but the vulnerability allows them to escalate, then the PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some privileges (like being authenticated) to exploit it. So PR:L. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the CVSS documentation. According to the CVSS v3.1 specification, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, then PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some level of access (like being authenticated) to exploit it. So in this case, since the attacker is authenticated, PR is Low (L). So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says \"successful exploitation could allow an authenticated low privilege operator user to change the state of certain settings\". There's no mention of requiring user interaction, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since it's a privilege escalation, the scope is Changed (C) because the attacker can gain higher privileges, which is a different scope. So S:C.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows changing settings, which might not directly affect confidentiality. But if the settings are sensitive, maybe confidentiality is affected. However, the description doesn't mention data exposure. So C is None (N) or Low (L)? Wait, the description says the attacker can change the state of certain settings. If changing settings could lead to unauthorized access to data, then C could be High (H). But the description doesn't specify that. So maybe C is None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't directly impact confidentiality. But if the settings are related to access controls, then changing them could affect confidentiality. However, the description is vague. Since the user is allowed to change settings, but the exact impact isn't clear. The problem is that the CVSS requires us to make an assumption based on the description. Since the vulnerability is a privilege escalation, the main impact is on integrity (changing settings) and availability (if the settings affect system operation). But the description doesn't mention confidentiality. So maybe C is None (N). However, sometimes privilege escalation can allow access to more data, so maybe C is Low (L). But without explicit mention, it's safer to assume C:N. Wait, but the CVSS requires us to make the best possible assessment. If the vulnerability allows changing settings, which could include things like access controls, then confidentiality could be affected. But the description doesn't specify. So perhaps the answer is C:N. Alternatively, maybe the answer is C:L. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The description says \"change the state of certain settings of a vulnerable system.\" If those settings are related to access controls, then confidentiality could be affected. But if they are just configuration settings, maybe not. Since the description is vague, but the main impact is on integrity (changing settings), so maybe C:N. But I'm not sure. Let me check the example. In the example given in the problem, the answer might have C:H if the settings are critical. But the problem says \"change the state of certain settings\", which could be anything. Since the user is an authenticated low privilege user, changing settings might not directly impact confidentiality. So I'll go with C:N.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can change settings, which directly affects the integrity of the system. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The description doesn't mention any impact on availability. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low complexity), PR:L (Low privileges required), UI:N (No user interaction), S:C (Scope changed), C:N (Confidentiality none), I:H (Integrity high), A:N (Availability none).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought PR might be N. Let me recheck. The PR is about the privileges required to exploit. If the attacker is already authenticated, does that count as PR:N? Or is PR about the privileges needed beyond authentication? For example, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, but the vulnerability allows them to escalate, then PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some privileges (like being authenticated) to exploit it. But according to the CVSS definition, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, then that's part of the exploit. But the PR metric is about the privileges required. If the attacker is already authenticated, then PR is Low (L) because they need to have some level of access (authenticated) to exploit it. So PR:L.\n\nSo the vector would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but the example in the problem's final line shows a different format. Let me check again. The user's example is Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. So in that example, PR:N. So maybe in this case, PR is N? Wait, why? Because the attacker is authenticated, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit. If the attacker is authenticated, but the vulnerability allows them to escalate, then the PR is Low (L) because they need to have some privileges (like being authenticated) to exploit it. But maybe the PR is N because the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges beyond being authenticated.

This hole is never initialized. Initialize the struct to zero before using it to avoid pushing uninitialized information to userspace.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a Linux kernel vulnerability related to an information leak in a triggered buffer. The main issue is that a struct'sample' has a hole between temperature and timestamp, which isn't initialized. They fixed it by initializing the struct to zero before using it.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, specifically in a triggered buffer. The struct is used to push data to user space. Since the issue is related to data being pushed to user space, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to be in the same process or have local access to exploit this. But wait, the struct is used in a triggered buffer, which might be part of the kernel's internal handling. However, the problem is that the struct is used to push data to userspace. So, the attacker would need to be in a position where they can access the buffer, which is local. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability requires the attacker to exploit the uninitialized data. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps. They just need to access the buffer and read the uninitialized data. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have some level of privilege. However, the description says it's a local struct, so maybe the attacker is already in the kernel context. But the fix is about initializing the struct before using it. If the attacker is local, they might have already elevated privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. Since the struct is used in the kernel, the attacker would need to have local access, which is considered as having high privileges. Wait, no. The PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attacker would need to have local access (i.e., be a user with local access to the system), which is considered as PR: Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to be root. Wait, no. Wait, the PR metric is defined as None (N), Low (L), High (H). For example, if the vulnerability requires the attacker to have user privileges, then PR is Low. If it requires root, then High. But in this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have local access, which is considered as having some privileges. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already in the system (local user), then PR is Low. But if the attacker needs to be root, then High. However, the description doesn't specify that. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attacker would need to have local access, which is considered as PR: Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to be root. Wait, but maybe the attacker can exploit this without needing elevated privileges. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is an information leak. The attacker can exploit it without any user interaction. The data is pushed to userspace, so the attacker can read it without needing user input. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the data is pushed to userspace, the scope is Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope. The attacker can't elevate privileges or affect other components beyond the initial scope. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability leaks uninitialized data. The data is sensitive, so the confidentiality impact is High (H) because the attacker can read the uninitialized data, which could be sensitive information.\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to modify data. The struct is used to push data, but the issue is about leaking data, not modifying it. So Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't affect availability. The issue is about data leakage, not causing a denial of service. So Availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: Low (L)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: High (H)\nI: None (N)\nA: None (N)\n\nThe vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Wait, but let me double-check. The attack vector is Local (L) because the struct is used in the kernel, and the attacker needs to be local. The attack complexity is Low because the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps. Privileges Required is Low because the attacker needs local access, which is considered as low. User interaction is None. Scope is Unchanged. Confidentiality is High because the data is leaked. Integrity and Availability are None. So the vector is correct.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.5999999999999996, "success": true}

This issue has been patched in version 1.8.180.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring problem. The user provided a CVE description about a mass assignment vulnerability in FreeScout. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, I'll recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The ones mentioned are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a mass assignment issue where the fill() method is called with all client-provided data. Since the application is self-hosted, the attacker would need to be able to send data to the server. That sounds like a network attack because the client can send data over the network. So AV should be Network (N). Wait, but if the application is self-hosted, maybe the attack is local? Hmm. Wait, mass assignment vulnerabilities typically occur when an attacker can send data to the server, which would be over the network. Unless the attacker is on the same machine, but the description doesn't mention that. So I think AV is Network (N).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The fill() method is called with all client data, so the attacker doesn't need to do anything complex. They just send the data. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability allows updating the Customer object, which might require some user privileges. But the description doesn't specify if the attacker needs to be authenticated. Wait, the fill() method is called with all client data, so maybe the attacker needs to be authenticated to send the data. But the problem is that the application doesn't validate the fields, so if the attacker is authenticated, they can exploit this. However, the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, then PR is Low (L). But if the attacker can exploit it without authentication, then PR is None (N). The description says it's a mass assignment vulnerability, which typically requires the attacker to be authenticated to send the data. So PR is Low (L)? Or maybe None? Wait, the fill() method is called with all client-provided data. If the attacker is not authenticated, they might not be able to send data to the server. But if the application is self-hosted, maybe the attacker is on the same network. But the description doesn't specify. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. However, in many cases, mass assignment vulnerabilities require the attacker to be authenticated. So I'll go with PR: Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is triggered by the client sending data, so no user interaction is needed. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the Customer object is being updated, and the vulnerability allows changing the channel and channel_id, which are part of the Customer object, the scope is Unchanged (U). Because the attack doesn't affect a different component, just the same component. So S: U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows an attacker to set arbitrary fields, which could include sensitive data. So if the attacker can set fields like channel and channel_id, they might be able to access or modify confidential information. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can modify the Customer object, which could lead to altering data. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A). The vulnerability doesn't directly affect availability. Unless the attacker can cause a denial of service by modifying data, but the description doesn't mention that. So A is None (N).\n\nWait, but the description says \"mass assignment vulnerability\" which allows the attacker to set unexpected values. So if the attacker can set fields that could lead to data corruption or other issues, maybe Availability is High? But the description doesn't mention any denial of service. So I think A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but I need to check if PR is correct. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, then PR is Low. But if the attacker can exploit it without authentication, then PR is None. The description says the fill() method is called with all client-provided data. If the client is authenticated, then the attacker can send data. But if the application is self-hosted, maybe the attacker is on the same network. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, then PR is Low. If not, then None. Since the description doesn't specify, but mass assignment vulnerabilities typically require the attacker to be authenticated, I think PR is Low. So the answer should have PR:L.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. If the application is self-hosted, maybe the attacker is on the same machine, but that's not specified. The description doesn't mention authentication. However, in most web applications, the client would need to be authenticated to send data. So PR is Low. So I'll stick with PR:L.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "score": 3.8, "success": true}

The user provided a CVE description about Arc before 1.26.1 on Windows having a bypass issue in site settings. The issue allows websites with previously granted permissions to add new permissions when the user clicks anywhere on the site.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the CVE description into the base metrics. Let me recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics: AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Each has specific options.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in site settings, and the user clicks anywhere on the website. Since the attack is initiated through the website, which is a network-based attack, AV should be Network (N). Wait, but the user is interacting with the website, so maybe it's Local (L)? Wait, no. The attack vector is how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the website is the vector, then it's network-based. But if the user is clicking on the site, maybe it's local? Hmm. Wait, the user is on the same network as the website, but the attack is through the website's interface. So AV is Network (N) because the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network. But maybe it's Local (L) if the user is interacting with the site. Wait, the description says the user clicks anywhere on the website. So the attack requires the user to be on the website, which is a local context. Wait, but the website is served over the network. So the attack vector is Network. I think AV is Network (N) because the attack is through the network, even though the user is interacting with the site. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The description says the user clicks anywhere on the website. The attack doesn't require any special setup, so the complexity is Low (L). So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The user has previously granted permissions, so the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges. The PR is None (N) because the attack doesn't require any privileges beyond what the user already has. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The user has to click anywhere on the website. So User Interaction is Required (R). Because the attack requires the user to take an action (clicking), so UI:R.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The description says the website can add new permissions. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to change the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system, then the scope is Changed (C). But if the attack is within the same component (like the user's permissions), then it's Unchanged (U). Wait, the original permissions are already granted, and the attack allows adding new permissions. So the scope is Changed (C) because the attack affects the system's confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Wait, but the user is the one granting permissions. If the attacker can add new permissions, that might affect the system's integrity (since the user's permissions are modified). So Scope is Changed (C). Wait, but the original description says the user has previously granted permissions. The attack allows adding new permissions. So the scope is Changed (C) because the attack affects a different component (the user's permissions) beyond the initial scope. So S:C.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows adding new permissions. If the attacker can access sensitive data, then C is High (H). But the description doesn't mention data exposure. However, adding new permissions might allow the attacker to access more data, so C could be High. But maybe it's Low if the permissions are not about data. Wait, the problem is about bypassing site settings, allowing new permissions. If the permissions are about accessing data, then C is High. But the description doesn't specify. However, since the user is granting permissions, and the attacker can add new ones, it's possible that confidentiality is affected. So I'll assume C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I). Adding new permissions could allow the attacker to modify the system's state, so I is High (H). For example, if the permissions allow the attacker to change settings, that's integrity. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A). The description doesn't mention any impact on availability. So A:N.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The user clicks on the website, which allows adding new permissions. The attack is about bypassing site settings. So the main impact is on the user's permissions, which could affect confidentiality (if the permissions allow access to data) or integrity (if the permissions allow modifying data). But the description doesn't specify. However, in the absence of specific info, the default for C and I is High if the attack allows unauthorized access or modification. But maybe the attack is more about integrity. Alternatively, since the user is the one granting permissions, maybe the attacker can modify the user's settings, which affects integrity. So I:H. Availability is not mentioned, so A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:N (None), UI:R (Required), S:C (Changed), C:H (High), I:H (High), A:N (None).\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the scope is correct. If the attack allows the attacker to add new permissions, which is a change in the user's settings, then the scope is Changed (C) because the attack affects a different component (the user's permissions) beyond the initial scope. So S:C is correct.\n\nBut some might argue that the scope is Unchanged if the attack is within the same component. However, in CVSS, the scope is Changed if the attack can affect resources beyond those that are directly impacted. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify the user's permissions, which could affect other components, then the scope is Changed. So S:C is correct.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "score": 1.0, "success": true}

The interface need to be released before unregistering hci device when usb disconnect. Removing BT usb dongle without properly releasing the interface may cause Kernel panic while unregister hci device.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a Linux kernel vulnerability related to Bluetooth and USB. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack, specifically with USB disconnect handling. The issue occurs when a USB dongle is removed without properly releasing an interface. Since the problem is related to USB, which is a network interface, the attack vector is likely Network (N). Wait, but USB is a physical connection. Hmm. Wait, the attack vector is how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs physical access to the device, then AV would be Physical (P). But the description mentions that removing the dongle (which is a physical action) might cause a kernel panic. However, the vulnerability might be exploitable remotely if the USB device is connected over a network. Wait, but USB is a local connection. So maybe AV is Local (L) because the attacker has to be physically connected to the device. Wait, but the problem is when the dongle is removed. If the attacker can disconnect the USB device, that's a local action. So AV would be Local (L). Wait, but the description says \"Removing BT usb dongle without properly releasing the interface may cause Kernel panic while unregister hci device.\" So the attack requires the attacker to have physical access to the device to remove the dongle. Therefore, AV is Local (L). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The attack vector is how the attacker can reach the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be physically present to remove the dongle, then AV is Physical (P). But if the vulnerability is triggered by a local action (like a local user), then AV is Local (L). Wait, the problem is that the dongle is a USB device. If the attacker is a local user, they can remove the dongle. But if the attacker is remote, they can't. So AV is Local (L). Wait, but the kernel is running on the device, so the attack vector is Local. So AV is Local (L). But I'm not sure. Let me check the CVSS definitions. Attack Vector: Network (N) - attack requires network access. Adjacent (A) - attack requires adjacent network. Local (L) - attack requires local access. Physical (P) - attack requires physical access. Since the attacker needs to be physically connected to the device to remove the USB dongle, maybe AV is Physical (P). But the vulnerability is in the kernel, so maybe the attack is local. Wait, the problem is that the dongle is a USB device. If the attacker is a local user, they can remove the dongle. So AV is Local (L). Hmm. I think AV is Local (L) because the attack is initiated by a local user. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me note that and check other metrics.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says that the interface needs to be released before unregistering the hci device. The complexity here is whether the attacker needs to have some prior access or not. Since the vulnerability is a missing release of the interface, the attack complexity is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps. They just need to remove the dongle without releasing the interface. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any privileges. The vulnerability is in the kernel, so even a local user can trigger it. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The attacker just needs to remove the dongle. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on the kernel's operation (kernel panic), the scope is Unchanged (U). Because the attack doesn't change the scope; it's within the same component. Wait, but if the kernel panic leads to a system crash, which could be considered a different scope. Wait, the scope is whether the attack can affect resources beyond the initial component. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain privileges, then the scope is Changed (C). But in this case, the vulnerability leads to a kernel panic, which is a system crash, but the scope is still the same component (kernel). So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability causes a kernel panic when the USB is disconnected. Does this affect confidentiality? If the kernel panic leads to data exposure, then C would be High (H). But the description doesn't mention data exposure. However, a kernel panic could lead to system instability, but not necessarily data leakage. So maybe C is None (N). Wait, but the problem is that the kernel panic is a result of improper interface release. However, the description doesn't mention any data being exposed. So C is None (N). Wait, but maybe the kernel panic could be considered as a denial of service, which affects availability. Wait, but the question is about the base metrics. Let me check the metrics again. The base metrics are C, I, A. For confidentiality, if the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to data, then C is High. If it's possible, then High. But the description doesn't mention that. So C is None (N). Wait, but the kernel panic could be a result of a flaw that might allow some data to be accessed. But without more info, I think C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability could allow the attacker to modify the kernel's state, leading to a panic. But the description doesn't mention any modification of data. So I is None (N). Wait, but if the kernel panic is due to improper handling, maybe the integrity is not affected. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The kernel panic would cause the system to crash, which is a denial of service. So A is High (H). Because the system becomes unavailable.\n\nWait, but let me recheck. The problem is that when the USB is disconnected without releasing the interface, the kernel panics when unregistering the hci device. So the availability is affected because the system crashes, making it unavailable. So A is High (H).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) - because the attacker needs to be local to remove the USB dongle.\n\nAC: Low (L) - no complex steps required.\n\nPR: None (N) - no privileges needed.\n\nUI: None (N) - no user interaction.\n\nS: Unchanged (U) - the scope is the same component (kernel).\n\nC: None (N) - no confidentiality impact.\n\nI: None (N) - no integrity impact.\n\nA: High (H) - denial of service via kernel panic.\n\nWait, but maybe the scope is Changed (C) if the kernel panic affects the system's availability. Wait, the scope is whether the attack affects a different component. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on the kernel's availability, then the scope is Unchanged (U). Because the attack is within the same component. So S is U.\n\nSo the vector would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nBut wait, the user's example had C:H, I:H, A:H. But in this case, the description doesn't mention confidentiality or integrity. So maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the CVE description.\n\nThe description says that removing the dongle without releasing the interface may cause a kernel panic while unregistering the hci device. The kernel panic is a system crash, which is an availability issue. So A is High. But what about confidentiality and integrity? If the kernel panic is due to a flaw in the code, maybe there's no data exposure or modification. So C and I are None. But maybe the kernel panic could be considered as a different scope. Wait, the scope is whether the attack can affect resources beyond the initial component. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain privileges, then the scope is Changed. But here, the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on the kernel's operation. So the scope remains the same. Therefore, S is Unchanged (U).\n\nSo the final vector would be:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nBut I'm not sure about AV. Let me think again. If the attacker needs to be physically present to remove the USB dongle, then AV is Physical (P). But the attack vector is how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is a local user, then AV is Local (L). But if the attacker needs physical access, then AV is Physical (P). The description says \"Removing BT usb dongle without properly releasing the interface may cause Kernel panic...\" So the attacker has to physically remove the dongle. So AV is Physical (P). Wait, but the kernel is running on the device, so the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker is on the same system. Wait, the attack vector is determined by the method of access. If the attacker is a local user, then AV is Local (L). If the attacker needs physical access, then AV is Physical (P). But in the context of CVSS, the attack vector is about the method of access. For example, if the vulnerability is triggered by a local user, then AV is Local. If it's triggered by a remote attacker, then AV is Network.

The user provided a CVE description about a WordPress plugin vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via a shortcode, which is part of the plugin. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have contributor-level access, that suggests the attack is happening through the application's interface, which is local. But wait, the plugin is part of WordPress, so maybe the attack vector is local because the attacker has to be logged in. But sometimes, if the attack is through a web interface, it's considered Network. Hmm. Wait, the description says \"authenticated attackers with contributor-level access\" so they have to be logged in. That would be Local (L) because the attacker needs to be on the same system or have access to the application's interface. But maybe the attack is via the web, so Network? Wait, the plugin is part of WordPress, so the attacker would need to be on the same network or have access to the site. Wait, the user is authenticated, so maybe it's Local. Let me think again. The attack vector is through the plugin's shortcode, which is part of the WordPress site. So the attacker has to be logged in to the WordPress admin, which is a local attack. So AV is Local (L). But sometimes, if the attack is via a web request, it's Network. Wait, the user is authenticated, so the attack vector is Local. So AV: L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability requires the attacker to have contributor access, but the description says \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.\" So the attack doesn't require any special setup beyond the user input. So the complexity is Low (L). Because the attacker can exploit it without needing to perform additional steps. So AC: L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low privilege level. So PR: L. Because the attacker needs to have some level of access, but not root or admin. So PR: L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says the attacker can inject scripts that execute when a user accesses the page. So the user has to visit the injected page. That implies that the user interaction is required. Wait, but the attacker is authenticated. Wait, the attacker injects the script, and then the user (who is not the attacker) accesses the page. So the user interaction is required. So UI: R. Wait, but the attacker is authenticated, so maybe the user interaction is not required. Wait, the attacker can inject the script, and then the user (any user) who visits the page will execute the script. So the user interaction is required for the script to execute. So UI: R. But some might argue that the attacker can inject the script without user interaction, but the script only executes when a user visits the page. So the user has to interact with the page. Therefore, UI: R.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the plugin, and the attack is on the same component (the plugin's output), the scope is Unchanged (U). Unless the attack can escalate to other components. But the description doesn't mention that. So S: U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can inject scripts, which can steal data. So confidentiality is High (H). Because the attacker can read sensitive information from the user's session or other data. So C: H.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject scripts, which can modify data. So integrity is High (H). Because the attacker can alter the content or data on the site. So I: H.\n\nAvailability (A): The attack is XSS, which doesn't directly affect availability. Unless the script causes denial of service, but the description doesn't mention that. So A: N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the user interaction is required. Let me check again. The attacker injects the script, and then the user has to visit the page. So the user interaction is required. So UI:R. But some might think that the attacker can exploit it without user interaction, but the script is executed when the user accesses the page. So the user interaction is required. So UI:R. But in some cases, if the attacker can inject the script and the user doesn't need to do anything else, maybe UI:N. Wait, the description says \"injected page\" which the user accesses. So the user has to interact with the page. Therefore, UI:R. So the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. But I need to confirm each metric again.\n\nWait, the attack vector: the attacker is authenticated and has contributor access. So the attack is via the application's interface, which is Local (L). So AV:L. Attack complexity is Low because the attacker can exploit it with minimal steps. PR:L because contributor access is a low privilege. UI:R because the user has to access the page. Scope is Unchanged. C:H, I:H, A:N. So the final vector is as above. But I need to make sure. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. For UI, if the attack requires user interaction, then it's R. If the attack can be done without user interaction, it's N. In this case, the script is injected, and the user has to visit the page. So the user interaction is required. So UI:R.

The user provided a CVE description about an out-of-bounds write in RT-Labs P-Net version 1.0.1 or earlier. The vulnerability allows an attacker to crash IO devices by sending a malicious RPC packet.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the attacker sends a malicious RPC packet. Since the attack is initiated over a network (RPC typically uses network protocols), AV should be Network (N). But wait, sometimes RPC can be local if it's within the same system, but the description says \"induce a crash in IO devices that use the library,\" which implies the attacker is targeting devices that are using the library, which might be on the same network. So AV:N makes sense here.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write. For this type of vulnerability, the attack complexity is usually low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any special steps beyond sending the malicious packet. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any prior privileges. The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication, so PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any need for user interaction. The attacker just sends a packet, so UI:N.\n\nScope (S): The scope refers to whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the attack is on the IO devices using the library, and the vulnerability is in the library itself, the scope is unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): An out-of-bounds write can lead to data corruption, but does it affect confidentiality? If the attacker can overwrite memory, they might access sensitive data, but the description mentions a crash, not data disclosure. However, in some cases, such vulnerabilities can lead to information disclosure. But the CVE description doesn't specify that. So maybe C:N. Wait, but the question is about the base metrics. The base score considers the potential impact. If the vulnerability allows writing beyond bounds, it could potentially lead to data corruption, which might affect confidentiality if the attacker can overwrite sensitive data. However, the description doesn't mention that. So maybe C:N. But I need to be careful here. Alternatively, if the attack can lead to arbitrary code execution, that would be a higher impact. But the description says it causes a crash, not execution. So maybe C:N. Wait, but the base metrics are about the potential impact. If the vulnerability can be exploited to cause a crash, that's an availability issue. But the question is about the base metrics. Let me check the standard. For out-of-bounds writes, the impact on confidentiality is usually low or none. But if the attacker can overwrite data structures, maybe they can manipulate the system's state, which could lead to information disclosure. However, without more info, I think the default is to assume that confidentiality is not directly affected. So C:N. Wait, but the base score for confidentiality is about the potential for unauthorized disclosure. If the attacker can overwrite memory, they might access data they shouldn't. But the description doesn't specify that. So maybe C:N. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The base score for confidentiality is High (H) if the vulnerability allows unauthorized disclosure of data. Since the description doesn't mention that, maybe it's N. But sometimes, even if the attack is a crash, the impact on confidentiality could be considered as none. So I'll go with C:N.\n\nIntegrity (I): An out-of-bounds write can allow the attacker to modify data structures, leading to potential integrity issues. So I:H. Because the attacker can alter data, which affects the integrity of the system.\n\nAvailability (A): The attack causes a crash, which affects availability. So A:H. Because the crash would make the device unavailable.\n\nWait, but the base score for availability is High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause denial of service. Since the crash is a denial of service, A:H is correct.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:N (None), UI:N (None), S:U (Unchanged), C:N (None), I:H (High), A:H (High).\n\nWait, but the user's example answer has C:H, I:H, A:H. Let me check again. The example given in the problem is Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. But in the description, the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write that causes a crash. So maybe the confidentiality is not directly affected, but the integrity is high because the attacker can modify data. However, the example answer has C:H. Wait, maybe the example is not the correct one. Let me think again. The example is just an example, not the actual answer. So back to the problem.\n\nThe user's CVE says the attacker can induce a crash. So the impact on availability is high (A:H). For confidentiality, if the attacker can overwrite memory, they might access sensitive data, but the description doesn't mention that. So C:N. But maybe the base score considers that the attack could lead to data corruption, which could be considered as a confidentiality issue. However, the standard for CVSS is that confidentiality is about unauthorized disclosure. So if the attacker can overwrite data, they might not be able to read it unless they can access the memory. So maybe C:N. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the attack could allow the attacker to modify data structures, leading to potential information disclosure. But without more info, it's safer to assume C:N. However, in some cases, even if the attack is a crash, the impact on confidentiality could be considered as none. So I'll stick with C:N.\n\nBut wait, the example answer in the problem has C:H. Maybe the example is not the correct one. Let me check the actual CVSS guidelines. For out-of-bounds writes, the impact on confidentiality is usually not considered high unless the attacker can read data. But if the attack allows the attacker to overwrite data, that's more about integrity. So I think the correct values are C:N, I:H, A:H. But I need to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the crash is a denial of service, which is availability. So A:H. The integrity is high because the attacker can modify data. So I:H. Confidentiality is none because the attack doesn't disclose data. So C:N. So the vector would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H. But the example answer in the problem has C:H. Maybe the example is wrong. But the user's example is just an example, not the actual answer. So I need to proceed with the correct values based on the description.\n\nSo the final vector would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H\n\nBut wait, the user's example has C:H, I:H, A:H. Maybe the example is not the correct one. Let me check again. The CVE says the attacker can induce a crash. So the availability is high. The integrity is high because the attacker can modify data. Confidentiality is none. So the answer should be C:N, I:H, A:H. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the user's example is just an example. So I'll proceed with the values I determined.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.5999999999999996, "success": true}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the'simple_chart' shortcode, which is part of the plugin. The description says that authenticated attackers with contributor-level access can exploit this. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the site, this suggests the attack vector is Local (L). Because the attacker has to be on the same network or have local access to the system, right? Wait, but the plugin is part of WordPress, so maybe the attack is through the web interface. Wait, but the user is authenticated, so maybe AV is Local? Or is it Network? Hmm. Wait, the attack vector is how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. Since the attacker is authenticated and can access the site, the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be on the same system or have local access. But wait, in web applications, sometimes even if the attacker is authenticated, the attack vector is considered Network (N) because the attack is over the network. Wait, I need to clarify. The CVSS defines AV as the attack vector. For example, if the attack requires the attacker to be on the same network, it's Network. If it's through a local exploit, like a physical device, it's Physical. But in this case, the attacker is authenticated and can access the site via the web interface. So the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network. Wait, but the user is authenticated, so maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker has to be logged in. Wait, I'm confused here. Let me check the CVSS definitions again. \n\nAttack Vector (AV) is the method by which the vulnerability is exploited. For example, if the attack can be done over the network without requiring the attacker to be local, then AV is Network (N). If the attacker needs to be on the same network, it's Adjacent (A). If the attacker has local access, it's Local (L). Physical is for physical access. \n\nIn this case, the attacker is authenticated and can access the site via the web interface. So the attack is over the network. Therefore, AV should be Network (N). Wait, but the attacker is authenticated, so maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker has to be logged in. Wait, no. The attack vector is about how the attacker can reach the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it remotely over the network, then AV is Network. If the attacker needs to be on the same system, it's Local. \n\nIn this case, the attacker is authenticated, but the attack is done via the web interface. So the attack is over the network. Therefore, AV is Network (N). \n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says that the vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The attacker needs to have contributor-level access. So the attack complexity is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to perform any special steps beyond having access. Since the attacker is already authenticated, the complexity is low. \n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs contributor-level access. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some level of access, but not root or admin. \n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says that the attacker can inject scripts that execute when a user accesses the page. So the user interaction is Required (R) because the user has to visit the injected page. Wait, but the attacker injects the script, and then the user has to access the page. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI is Required (R). \n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new vulnerability in another component. Since the vulnerability is in the plugin, and the attack is on the same component (the plugin's shortcode), the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the attacker can exploit this to gain more privileges, then scope would be Changed (C). However, the description doesn't mention that. It's a Stored XSS, which is a vulnerability in the same component. So the scope is Unchanged (U). \n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts, which can steal data. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can read sensitive information. \n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject scripts, which can modify content. So integrity is High (H) because the attacker can alter data. \n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability is XSS, which doesn't directly affect availability. So availability is None (N). \n\nWait, but maybe the attacker could cause denial of service by injecting malicious scripts, but the description doesn't mention that. So A is None (N). \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Network (N)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: Low (L)\nUI: Required (R)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: High (H)\nI: High (H)\nA: None (N)\n\nWait, but I need to check again. Let me re-examine the UI. The user interaction is required because the user has to access the page with the injected script. So UI is Required (R). \n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. \n\nWait, but the user is authenticated. Does that affect PR? The PR is the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low privilege level. So PR is Low (L). \n\nYes, that's correct. So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 1.8999999999999995, "success": true}

A low privileged local attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to fully impersonating the user.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a vulnerability in Dell Avamar. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attacker is local. So AV should be Local (L). Because the attacker needs to be on the same system, right? So AV:L.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions \"low privileged local attacker\". The term \"low privileged\" might relate to the privileges required, but the attack complexity here. Wait, the attack complexity is about how hard it is for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have low privileges, that might affect PR, not AC. But the description doesn't mention anything about the complexity of the attack. So maybe AC is Low (L) by default unless there's a reason to think it's high. But I'm not sure. Wait, the problem says to determine each metric based on the description. The description says \"low privileged local attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability\". The attack complexity might be low because the attacker doesn't need to do anything complicated. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker is low privileged. So PR:L. Because the attacker needs to have low privileges to exploit it. So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows the attacker to impersonate the user. If the scope is unchanged, that means the attack doesn't affect other components. But if the attacker can take over the user's privileges, that might be a scope change. Wait, the scope is about whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. If the attacker can impersonate the user, that might be a change in scope. But I'm not sure. Let me think. The original component is the AUI, and the attacker can impersonate the user. If the attacker can take over the user's privileges, that's a change in scope. So S:C. But I need to check. The scope is Changed (C) if the attack affects a different component. If the attacker can take over the user's account, that's a different component. So S:C.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows the attacker to impersonate the user. That would mean they can access the user's data, so confidentiality is High (H). So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I): If the attacker can impersonate the user, they might be able to modify data. So integrity is High (H). I:H.\n\nAvailability (A): The description doesn't mention anything about availability. So A:N.\n\nWait, but the original description says \"fully impersonating the user\". So that would imply that the attacker can access all the user's data (C:H) and possibly modify it (I:H). But availability isn't mentioned, so A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:C, C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nWait, but the scope. Let me double-check. The scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. If the attacker can impersonate the user, that's a different component. So S:C. But if the vulnerability is within the same component, maybe S:U. Hmm. For example, if the vulnerability is in the AUI, and the attacker can impersonate the user, which is part of the same component, then maybe the scope is unchanged. But I'm not sure. The CVSS scope is about whether the attack can affect resources beyond those directly affected by the vulnerability. If the attacker can take over the user's account, that's a different component. So S:C. But I'm not 100% certain. Let me check the CVSS definitions. Scope is Changed if the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new, separate impact. So if the attacker can take over the user's account, that's a different component. So S:C.\n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but the user's answer example had S:U. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The original description says the attacker is a low privileged local attacker. The vulnerability is in the AUI. If the attacker can impersonate the user, that might be within the same component. For example, if the AUI is part of the system, and the attacker can impersonate the user, that's still within the same component. So maybe the scope is unchanged. So S:U. But I'm confused. Let me check the CVSS scope definition. Scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new impact on a different component. If the attacker can take over the user's account, that's a different component. So S:C. But if the vulnerability is in the same component, maybe S:U. For example, if the vulnerability is in the AUI, and the attacker can impersonate the user, which is part of the same component, then S:U. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is S:U. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example answer had S:U. So maybe the correct answer here is S:U. Wait, the example given in the problem is for a different CVE, but the user's example shows S:U. So perhaps in this case, the scope is unchanged. Because the attacker is exploiting the same component (AUI) and the impact is on the same component. So S:U. Therefore, the scope is Unchanged. So S:U.\n\nSo then, the vector would be AV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nBut the original description says \"fully impersonating the user\". That could imply that the attacker can access the user's data (C:H) and modify it (I:H). So the answer would be:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nBut I need to make sure.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request).\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the nosurf middleware for Go, which is supposed to prevent CSRF attacks. The issue is that versions before 1.2.0 don't check the Referer header correctly, allowing attackers to bypass CSRF checks if they control content on the target site or a subdomain. They can manipulate cookies and use the CSRF token to make requests on behalf of the user.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The attacker needs to have control over content on the target site or a subdomain. Since the attacker can exploit this via a subdomain (like attacker.example.com), which is a different domain but related, this would be considered an Adjacent (A) attack vector. Wait, but sometimes subdomains are considered part of the same origin. However, in this case, the attacker is on a subdomain, which is a different origin. But the attack vector here is that the attacker can inject content into the target site or a subdomain. So maybe it's Network (N)? Wait, no. Because the attacker isn't necessarily attacking over the network. They have to have control over the content, which could be via XSS or other means. But the actual attack is done via the browser, so maybe it's Local (L)? Wait, no. The attacker is not directly accessing the system locally. They are exploiting a vulnerability in the application's handling of requests. Hmm. Let me think again. The attack vector here is that the attacker can send a request from a different origin (subdomain) to the target site. So the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can send requests over the network. Wait, but the attacker is on the same network? Or is it that the attacker can send requests from their own site (subdomain) to the target. So the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can send requests over the network. But maybe it's Adjacent (A) because the subdomain is adjacent. Wait, the CVSS defines Attack Vector as the path by which the attack is initiated. For example, Network (N) is when the attack is delivered over a network, like via HTTP. Adjacent (A) is when the attack is delivered via a physically or logically adjacent network, like a local network. But in this case, the attacker is on a different domain but can inject content. So maybe it's Network (N) because the attack is delivered via HTTP requests. Alternatively, if the attacker is on the same network, but the description doesn't specify that. The attacker can be on any site that can inject content into the target. So the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can send requests over the network. Wait, but the attacker is not directly accessing the system. They are exploiting a vulnerability in the application's handling of requests. So the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can send requests from their own site (subdomain) to the target. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity here is whether the attacker needs to perform multiple steps. The attacker needs to have control over the content (like via XSS) and then craft a request. But the description says that the vulnerability is due to the misuse of the Go library, which categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text, so the Referer header isn't checked. So the attack complexity is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to have any special tools or steps beyond exploiting the vulnerability. The attack is straightforward once the attacker has control over the content. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any privileges. They just need to have control over the content on the target site or subdomain. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attacker needs to have the user interact with the malicious content. For example, if the attacker uses XSS, the user has to click on a link. But the description says that the attacker can bypass CSRF checks if they control the content. So maybe the user interaction is required. Wait, the attacker can manipulate cookies and craft requests. But if the attacker can inject content into the target site, then the user might have to interact with that content. For example, if the attacker has XSS on the target site, the user would have to click on a malicious link. So UI:R. But the description says that the attacker can bypass CSRF checks by having control over the content. So maybe the user interaction is required. However, in some cases, if the attacker can inject a request without user interaction, like via a script, then UI:N. But the description mentions that the attacker can manipulate cookies, which might require the user to be logged in. So maybe UI:N? Wait, the attacker can craft cross-site requests to the target site. So the user's browser would send the request, which requires the user to be on the attacker's site. So the user has to be on the attacker's site, which is a subdomain. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI:R. But I'm not sure. Let me check. If the attacker can inject a script into the target site (XSS), then the user would have to interact with that script. So UI:R. But if the attacker can exploit a vulnerability that allows them to send a request without user interaction, like via a stored XSS, then maybe UI:N. But the description says that the attacker can bypass CSRF checks by having control over the content. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI:R.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. In this case, the vulnerability is in the middleware, which affects the application's handling of requests. The attack doesn't change the scope because the attacker is exploiting the same component (the application's handling of requests). So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can access the user's cookies and CSRF token, which is a confidentiality issue. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can modify the user's requests, which could alter data. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't directly affect availability. So A:N.\n\nWait, but the description mentions that the attacker can override the cookie with a new token. That's more about integrity (modifying data) and confidentiality (accessing the token). So C:H and I:H. Availability is not mentioned, so A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:N (None), UI:R (Required), S:U (Unchanged), C:H (High), I:H (High), A:N (None).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought UI:R. Let me check again. The attacker needs to have control over the content, which could be via XSS. If the attacker uses XSS, then the user has to interact with the malicious content. So UI:R. But if the attacker can exploit a vulnerability that allows them to send a request without user interaction, like via a stored XSS, then maybe UI:N. However, the description says that the attacker can bypass CSRF checks by having control over the content. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI:R.\n\nBut some sources say that for CSRF, the user interaction is required. So UI:R. So the vector would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but the answer example in the prompt has UI:N. Let me check again. The example given in the problem is:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\nBut in this case, the user interaction is required. So maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the CVE description.\n\nThe vulnerability allows an attacker who controls content on the target site or subdomain to bypass CSRF checks. The attacker can manipulate cookies. So the attacker needs to have the user interact with the malicious content. For example, if the attacker has XSS on the target site, the user would have to click on a link. Therefore, UI:R. But if the attacker can inject a request without user interaction, like via a stored XSS, then UI:N. However, the description says that the attacker can bypass CSRF checks by having control over the content. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI:R.\n\nBut maybe the user interaction is not required. For example, if the attacker can send a request from their own site (subdomain) to the target site, which is a cross-site request. In that case, the user doesn't need to interact with the malicious content. Wait, but the attacker needs to have the user's browser send the request. So the user has to be on the attacker's site (subdomain) to make the request. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI:R.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. For UI, if the attack requires the user to interact with the malicious content, then UI:R. Otherwise, UI:N. In this case, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability by having the user's browser send a request from their own site (subdomain) to the target. So the user has to be on the attacker's site, which is a subdomain. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI:R.\n\nBut maybe the user doesn't need to interact. For example, if the attacker can inject a script into the target site (XSS), then the user would have to click on a link.

The user provided a CVE description about a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's drm driver. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, so it's related to the kernel's code. Use-after-free issues typically require local access because the attacker needs to be in the same process or have access to the kernel. So AV should be Local (L). Wait, but sometimes if it's a kernel vulnerability, could it be Network? Hmm, no. Use-after-free in kernel code is usually local because the attacker has to be running in kernel mode. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires the attacker to have access to the kernel, but the complexity here is about how hard it is to exploit. The fix involved dropping of_node_put() in parse_dt and calling it in error paths. The original issue was that the host_node was freed but still used. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to do anything complicated. They just need to trigger the code path where the node is freed and then used. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). Since it's a kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need to have kernel privileges. But the description doesn't mention needing elevated privileges. Wait, use-after-free in kernel code usually requires local access, which implies that the attacker is already in the kernel. So PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to have any privileges beyond what's already required to access the kernel. Wait, but maybe the attacker needs to be in the kernel. Wait, PR is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attacker would need to have local access, which is already a privilege. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. So if the attacker is already in the kernel, then PR is None (N) because they don't need to elevate privileges. So PR is N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is a use-after-free, which is typically an automated exploit. The user doesn't need to interact with the system. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit would affect the kernel's integrity and availability, but the scope here is unchanged. Wait, the scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit can lead to privilege escalation, then the scope would be Changed (C). But the description doesn't mention privilege escalation. It's a use-after-free, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, which would change the scope. However, the original description doesn't specify if the scope changes. Wait, the CVSS scope is about whether the vulnerability can affect resources beyond those directly impacted. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, then the scope is Changed. But in this case, the use-after-free could lead to arbitrary code execution, which would change the scope. However, the original description doesn't mention that. The fix is about preventing the use-after-free, which is a memory corruption issue. So the scope might be Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel's memory management). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution, then the scope would be Changed (C) because the attacker can gain control over the system. But the original description doesn't specify that. The problem is that the CVSS scope is about whether the vulnerability can affect resources beyond those directly impacted. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution, then the scope is Changed. However, if the vulnerability is a use-after-free that doesn't lead to privilege escalation, then the scope is Unchanged. Since the description doesn't mention privilege escalation, maybe the scope is Unchanged (U). But I'm not sure. Let me check. The original problem is a use-after-free, which is a memory corruption issue. If the attacker can exploit this to execute arbitrary code, then the scope would be Changed. But the description doesn't specify that. So maybe the scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability is within the same component (the kernel's code). So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The use-after-free could allow the attacker to read memory, which would be a confidentiality issue. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). If the attacker can overwrite memory, they could modify data structures, leading to integrity issues. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A). The use-after-free could lead to a crash or denial of service, so A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:H. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. Wait, but I'm not sure about the scope. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain control, then the scope would be Changed. But the original description doesn't mention that. The fix is about preventing the use-after-free, which is a memory corruption. So maybe the scope is Unchanged. So the answer would be as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.6000000000000005, "success": true}

Improper rendering of certain file types lead to cross-site scripting.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about GitLab CE/EE with a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The issue is about improper rendering of file types leading to XSS. XSS typically occurs when an attacker can inject malicious scripts into content that's viewed by other users. Since this is a web application, the attack vector is likely Network (N) because the vulnerability can be exploited over the network, not requiring physical access or local access. So AV:N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says \"improper rendering of certain file types.\" If the attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious file, that might require some user interaction, but the complexity here is probably Low (L) because the attack doesn't require advanced techniques. The attacker just needs to get the user to interact with the malicious file, which is considered low complexity. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior access or privileges. The vulnerability is in the rendering process, so anyone can exploit it without being authenticated. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is Required (R) because the user has to open the malicious file for the XSS to occur. However, sometimes XSS can be exploited without user interaction if the attacker can inject the script into a page that's viewed by others. Wait, but the description says \"improper rendering of certain file types lead to cross-site scripting.\" If the user has to interact with the file, then UI:R. But if the attacker can inject the script into a page that's served to the user without their action, then UI:N. Hmm. The CVE mentions that the issue is in rendering, which might be triggered when a user opens a file. So maybe UI:R. But I need to check. For example, if the attacker can inject the script into a file that's served to the user, then the user doesn't need to interact. But if the user has to download and open the file, then UI:R. The description isn't clear, but since it's XSS, it's more likely that the user interaction is required. So UI:R. Wait, but some XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited without user interaction if the attacker can inject the script into a page that's viewed by others. However, in this case, the problem is with rendering certain file types. If the file is served to the user, maybe the user has to open it. So UI:R. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. For example, if the attacker can inject a script into a file that's served to the user, then the user doesn't need to interact. But if the user has to download and open the file, then UI:R. Since the description says \"improper rendering of certain file types lead to cross-site scripting,\" it's possible that the user has to interact with the file (like opening it), so UI:R. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer expects UI:N. Wait, in the case of XSS, if the attacker can inject the script into a page that's viewed by the user, then UI:N. But if the user has to click on a link or open a file, then UI:R. Since the problem is about rendering, maybe the user has to interact. So I'll go with UI:R.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to elevate privileges beyond what's already possible. The scope is unchanged, so S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is High (H) because XSS can allow an attacker to steal user data, cookies, etc. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I) is High (H) because the attacker can modify the content that users see, leading to potential data tampering. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A) is None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't directly affect the availability of the service. So A:N.\n\nWait, but the user might have to interact with the file, so UI:R. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. For XSS, the user interaction is required. For example, in the case of reflected XSS, the user has to click on a link. So UI:R. Therefore, the User Interaction is Required. So UI:R.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but some sources might say that for XSS, UI is not required. Let me check. For example, in the case of stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact if the attacker can inject the script into a page that's served to other users. But in this case, the problem is with rendering certain file types. If the attacker can inject a script into a file that's served to the user, then the user doesn't need to interact. But if the user has to open the file, then UI:R. The description says \"improper rendering of certain file types lead to cross-site scripting.\" So maybe the user has to open the file, which would require UI:R. But I'm not entirely sure. However, in many XSS cases, the user interaction is required. So I'll stick with UI:R.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

The user provided a CVE description about memory safety bugs in Firefox and Thunderbird. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the bugs are in Firefox and Thunderbird, which are web browsers. Memory corruption issues in browsers typically allow remote code execution via network-based attacks, like exploiting a web page. So AV should be Network (N) because the attack can be launched over the network without needing physical access or local access.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions \"with enough effort some of these could have been exploited.\" That suggests that the attack isn't trivial and requires some skill or resources. So AC is High (H) because it's not easy to exploit, requiring more effort than a low complexity attack.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the bugs are memory safety issues, which usually don't require any prior privileges.

If a remote attacker gains a user account, they can then exploit the vulnerability to launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. We have already fixed the vulnerability in the following version: File Station 5 5.5.6.4847 and later\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a NULL pointer dereference in File Station 5. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker with a user account to cause a denial of service (DoS). The fix is in version 5.5.6.4847 and later.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attacker needs a user account. That implies the attack is through a network, right? Because the attacker is remote. So AV should be Network (N). Wait, but if the attacker needs to have a user account, does that mean they have to be authenticated? Hmm. Wait, the attack vector here is that the attacker can exploit the vulnerability once they have a user account. So the attack is via the network, but requires authentication. But in CVSS, AV is about how the attack is delivered. If the attacker is remote and needs to be authenticated, AV is still Network (N), because the attack is over the network. But maybe the Attack Complexity (AC) comes into play here. Let me think. The user has to have a user account, which might be considered as requiring some privileges. Wait, but the PR (Privileges Required) is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker already has a user account, maybe that's considered as having low privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have a user account, that might be considered as requiring low privileges (L), because they don't need admin rights. But maybe the PR is None (N) because the attacker can exploit it without needing any privileges beyond having an account. Wait, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker already has a user account, maybe that's considered as having some privileges. But the PR options are None, Low, High. So if the attacker needs to have a user account, that's a low privilege requirement. So PR would be Low (L). Wait, but maybe the PR is None because the attacker can exploit it without needing any specific privileges beyond being authenticated. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the CVSS definitions again. \n\nAttack Vector (AV) is the path by which an attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attack is via the network, AV is N. If it's adjacent, A, etc. The description says the attacker is remote, so AV is N. \n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is whether the attack requires user interaction or not. Wait, no. AC is about the complexity of the attack. If the attack requires the attacker to have some specific conditions, like the user account, that might be considered as high complexity. Wait, the AC metric is whether the attack requires the attacker to have some specific conditions. For example, if the attack requires the attacker to have a user account, that might be considered as high complexity. Wait, no. The AC metric is about the complexity of the attack, not the privileges. Wait, the AC is Low (L) if the attack can be performed without requiring the attacker to have any special conditions, like the user account. Wait, no. Let me recall: Attack Complexity (AC) is the complexity of the attack. If the attack requires the attacker to have some specific conditions, like the user account, that might be considered as high complexity. Wait, no. The AC metric is about the complexity of the attack, not the privileges. For example, if the attack requires the attacker to have a user account, that's part of the privileges required (PR), not the complexity. So AC is about whether the attack requires the attacker to have some specific conditions that are not related to privileges. For example, if the attack requires the attacker to have a user account, that's part of PR. So AC would be Low (L) if the attack can be done with minimal steps. Wait, maybe the AC is High (H) if the attack requires the attacker to have some specific conditions. But I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The attack requires the attacker to have a user account. That's part of the PR (Privileges Required). So PR would be Low (L) because the attacker needs to have a user account, which is a low privilege level. But the AC is about the complexity of the attack. If the attack is straightforward once the attacker has the user account, then AC is Low. So AC would be Low (L). \n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs a user account. So that's a low privilege requirement. So PR is Low (L). \n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing user interaction. So UI is None (N). \n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows a DoS attack. The scope is whether the attack affects a different component. Since the DoS is on the same component (the service itself), the scope is Unchanged (U). \n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows DoS, which doesn't directly affect confidentiality. So C is None (N). \n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the DoS attack doesn't affect integrity. So I is None (N). \n\nAvailability (A): The DoS attack directly affects availability. So A is High (H). \n\nWait, but the description says the attacker can launch a DoS attack. So the availability is High (H). \n\nPutting it all together: \n\nAV: N (Network, since the attacker is remote)\nAC: L (Low complexity, as the attack is straightforward once the attacker has a user account)\nPR: L (Low privileges required, as the attacker needs a user account)\nUI: N (No user interaction required)\nS: U (Scope unchanged, since the attack affects the same component)\nC: N (No confidentiality impact)\nI: N (No integrity impact)\nA: H (High availability impact)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nWait, but I need to check if the PR is correct. The PR is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have a user account, that's a low privilege requirement. So PR is L. \n\nBut maybe the PR is None (N) because the attacker can exploit it without needing any specific privileges beyond being authenticated. Wait, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have a user account, that's a low privilege level. So PR is L. \n\nAlternatively, if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing any privileges (like being an unauthenticated attacker), then PR would be N. But in this case, the attacker needs to have a user account, which implies that they are authenticated. So the PR is L. \n\nSo the final vector is as above. Let me check again. \n\nAnother point: the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker is remote. The attack complexity is Low (L) because the attack doesn't require any special conditions beyond having a user account. The privileges required are Low (L) because the attacker needs to have a user account. User interaction is None (N). Scope is Unchanged (U). Confidentiality, Integrity are None (N), Availability is High (H). \n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.0, "success": true}

The CVE is about vBulletin versions allowing attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via Template Conditionals. The exploit uses a specific syntax like var_dump(\"test\") to bypass security checks. \n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is triggered by crafting template code, which is part of the application's data input. Since the attacker needs to have access to the template engine, which is part of the application's code, this is likely a Local (L) attack. Wait, but if the attacker can send crafted input through the web interface, maybe it's Network (N)? Hmm. Wait, the attack is via the template engine, which is part of the application. So the attacker would need to have access to the application's input, which is typically through the web interface. So maybe AV:N? Wait, no. Wait, the attack is via the template code, which is part of the application's data. So the attacker would need to have access to the application's input, which is usually through the network. Wait, but the attack is not through network, but through the application's own code. Wait, maybe it's Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the application's code or input. Wait, I'm confused. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the template engine, which is part of the application. So the attacker would need to have access to the application's input, which is typically through the web interface. So the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can send crafted input via the web. But wait, the attack is not through network, but through the application's own code. Wait, maybe it's Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the application's code or input. Wait, the description says \"by abusing Template Conditionals in the template engine\". So the attacker is using the template engine's functionality, which is part of the application. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the application's code or input. Wait, but the attacker can exploit this by sending crafted input through the web interface. So the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can send the crafted input via the web. Hmm. I think this is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. For Attack Vector, Network (N) means the attack is delivered over a network. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability through the network, then AV:N. If the attacker needs to be on the same system, then AV:L. In this case, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted input through the web interface, which is a network-based attack. So AV:N. Wait, but the template code is part of the application's data. So the attacker would need to have access to the application's input, which is through the web. So AV:N. But maybe the attack is Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the application's code. Wait, no. The attacker can exploit this by sending input through the web, so it's network-based. So AV:N. \n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires the attacker to craft specific template code. The complexity is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to have any special tools or knowledge beyond knowing the syntax. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any privileges. The vulnerability is exploitable without any prior access. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The exploit is triggered by the attacker's crafted input, which is sent to the application. The user doesn't need to interact. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code, which can lead to full system compromise. The scope is Changed (C) because the attack can affect resources beyond the original component. Wait, but the original component is the template engine. If the attacker can execute arbitrary code, that's a change in scope. So S:C.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can read data, so High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can modify data, so High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The attacker can cause denial of service, so High (H).\n\nWait, but the description says \"execute arbitrary PHP code\". So that would allow the attacker to read, modify, and potentially disrupt the system. So all three (C, I, A) are High. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:N (None), UI:N (None), S:C (Changed), C:H, I:H, A:H.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the scope is changed. The original component is the template engine. If the attacker can execute arbitrary code, that's a change in scope because the attacker can access other parts of the system. So S:C. \n\nYes, that's correct.

The endpoint performs a `HEAD` request to verify the existence of a specified resource without setting a timeout. An attacker can exploit this by sending multiple requests to an attacker-controlled server that hangs, causing the application to block and become unresponsive to other requests.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a denial of service in the typeahead endpoint of h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0. The vulnerability allows an attacker to send multiple requests to a controlled server that hangs, causing the application to block and become unresponsive.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attacker sends requests to an attacker-controlled server. Since the attack is initiated from a remote server, the attack vector is Network (N). Wait, but the endpoint is part of the application, so maybe the attacker is targeting the application's endpoint. But the attack requires the attacker to send requests to the application, which is on the same network. Wait, the description says the attacker sends requests to their own server, which is controlled by them. So the application is being attacked by an external entity. So AV is Network (N) because the attack is from a remote network.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability doesn't mention any complexity. The endpoint doesn't set a timeout, so the attacker can just send multiple requests. Since the attack is straightforward, the complexity is Low (L). No special tools or steps needed beyond sending the requests.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior access or privileges. They can exploit this from the network.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is None (N) because the attack can be automated without user interaction. The application just blocks when the requests are sent.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't change the scope. The attack affects the same component (the application itself) and doesn't allow the attacker to gain access to other components.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't disclose any data. It's a denial of service, so confidentiality isn't impacted.\n\nIntegrity (I) is None (N) as well. The attack doesn't modify data or compromise the integrity of the system.\n\nAvailability (A) is High (H) because the denial of service makes the application unresponsive, which directly impacts availability.\n\nPutting it all together, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Wait, but the user's example had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The vulnerability is a denial of service, which affects availability. So A is High. But what about C and I? The description doesn't mention any data being leaked or modified. So C and I should be None. But sometimes, if the attack can lead to data loss or corruption, but in this case, it's just blocking. So yes, C and I are N. So the final vector is as above. Let me confirm each metric again.\n\nAV: Network (N) because the attack is from a remote server. AC: Low (L) because no complexity. PR: None (N). UI: None (N). S: Unchanged (U). C: None (N). I: None (N). A: High (H).

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a WordPress plugin vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via the 'id' parameter, which is a URL parameter. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have Contributor-level access, but the attack is through a parameter that's part of the URL, I think AV is Network (N). Wait, but the attacker has to be authenticated. Wait, no. Wait, the attack vector here is that the attacker can inject scripts via the 'id' parameter. But how is the attack vector determined? If the attacker can exploit it over the network, then AV is Network. But if the attack requires local access, then it's Local. But the description says \"authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access\". So the attacker needs to be authenticated, which might imply that the attack vector is Local (L) because it's within the same network or system. Wait, but the parameter is in the URL, so maybe it's Network. Hmm. Wait, the CVSS defines AV as Network (N) if the attack can be done over a network, Adjacent (A) if it's from a neighboring network, Local (L) if it's from the same system, and Physical (P) if it's physical access. Since the attacker is authenticated and can inject via a parameter, maybe it's Local. But the parameter is part of the URL, which is accessible over the network. Wait, but the attacker needs to be authenticated. So maybe the attack vector is Local because the attacker has access to the system. Wait, but the parameter is in the URL, so maybe the attack is over the network. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the 'id' parameter, which is part of the URL. So if an attacker can manipulate that parameter, they can inject scripts. But to do that, they need to be authenticated. So the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker has to be logged in and can access the system. Wait, but the parameter is in the URL, which is part of the network. Maybe AV is Network (N) because the attack can be done over the network. But the attacker needs to be authenticated. Hmm. Maybe the correct AV is Local (L) because the attacker has to be authenticated and can access the system. Wait, but the parameter is in the URL, which is part of the network. I think I need to check the CVSS guidelines. According to CVSS v3.1, Attack Vector (AV) is Network if the attack can be done over a network, Adjacent if it's from a neighboring network, Local if it's from the same system, and Physical if it's physical access. Since the attacker is authenticated and can inject via a URL parameter, which is part of the network, but the attacker has to be logged in. Wait, but the attack vector is determined by how the attacker can reach the vulnerable component. If the attacker can exploit it over the network, then AV is Network. But if the attacker needs to be on the same system, then Local. Since the plugin is for WordPress, and the attack is via a URL parameter, the attacker can send a malicious URL to a user, who then visits it. So the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can exploit it over the network. But the attacker needs to be authenticated. Wait, but the attacker is authenticated, so maybe the attack vector is Local. Wait, no. The attacker is authenticated, but the attack is done via a URL parameter. So the attacker can send a malicious URL to a user, who then accesses it. So the attack is over the network. Therefore, AV is Network (N). But the attacker needs to be authenticated. Wait, but the attacker is authenticated, but the attack is done via the URL. So the attack vector is Network. So AV is N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says that the vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The attacker needs to have Contributor-level access. So the attack complexity is High (H) because the attacker needs to have certain privileges (Contributor-level) to exploit the vulnerability. Wait, but the attack complexity is about the complexity of the attack. If the attacker needs to have certain privileges, that's part of the Privileges Required (PR) metric, not AC. So AC is about whether the attack requires the attacker to have specific knowledge or steps. Since the attack is via a parameter, and the attacker can inject the script by manipulating the 'id' parameter, the complexity is Low (L) because it's straightforward. Wait, but the attacker needs to be authenticated. Wait, the attack complexity is about the steps required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it with minimal steps, then AC is Low. So in this case, the attacker can inject the script by manipulating the 'id' parameter, which is a simple step. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have Contributor-level access. So PR is High (H) because the attacker needs to have a certain level of privilege. Wait, but the description says \"authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above\". So the attacker needs to have Contributor-level access. So PR is High (H) because the attacker needs to have a certain level of privilege. Wait, but in CVSS, PR is None (N), Low (L), or High (H). If the attacker needs to have a certain privilege level, then PR is High. So PR is H.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says that the attacker can inject scripts in pages that will execute when a user accesses an injected page. So the user has to access the page, which implies that the attack requires user interaction. Wait, but the user is the one who is being targeted. Wait, the attacker injects the script, and then the user accesses the page. So the user has to click on the malicious link. Therefore, UI is Required (R). Wait, but the description says \"authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the attacker injects the script, and then the user accesses the page. So the user has to interact with the page. Therefore, UI is Required (R). But wait, the user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. So UI is R.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new vulnerability that affects a different component. The description says that the vulnerability is in the 'id' parameter, and the attack allows injecting scripts. Since the attack affects the same component (the plugin), the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability to gain higher privileges or affect other components, then scope is Changed (C). But in this case, the attack is about XSS, which affects the same component. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows injecting scripts, which can steal data. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can read sensitive information. Wait, but the description says the attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts. So the attacker can execute code, which could lead to stealing data, so C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject scripts, which can modify data. So integrity is High (H) because the attacker can alter data.\n\nAvailability (A): The attack is XSS, which doesn't directly affect availability. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: H (High)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nSo the vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but let me check again. The user interaction is required because the user has to access the page. So UI is R. But some might argue that the user interaction is not required because the attacker can inject the script, and the user just needs to visit the page. So UI is R. But in some cases, if the user is not required to interact, like if the script is automatically executed, then UI is N. But in this case, the user has to access the page, so UI is R. So the vector is correct.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 0.6999999999999993, "success": true}

To properly release it, we should call r8712_free_io_queue() in r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit(). Besides, in r871xu_dev_remove(), r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() will be called by r871x_dev_unload() under condition `padapter->bup` and r8712_free_io_queue() is called by r8712_free_drv_sw(). However, r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() does not rely on `padapter->bup` and calling r8712_free_io_queue() in r8712_free_drv_sw() is negative for better understading the code. So I move r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() into r871xu_dev_remove(), and remove r8712_free_io_queue() from r8712_free_drv_sw().\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a memory leak in the Linux kernel's rtl8712 driver. I need to figure out the base metrics for the CVSS score.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is a system-level component. If an attacker can exploit this, they'd need to have local access, right? Because the memory leak is in a driver, which is part of the kernel. So AV should be Local (L) because the attacker has to be on the same system. Wait, but sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely. But this specific issue is about a memory leak in a driver, which is more likely to be local. So AV: Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is a memory leak. The fix involves calling a function to free memory. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps. They just need to trigger the scenario where the memory isn't freed. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to have local access to the system, but the vulnerability doesn't require any specific privileges beyond that. So PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges, just local access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The memory leak can be triggered without any user interaction. The attacker can exploit it by running the affected code, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The scope refers to whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the memory leak is within the same component (the driver), the scope is Unchanged (U). The impact is on the same component, so S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The memory leak could expose sensitive data if the memory contains such information. However, the description doesn't mention data exposure, just a leak. But in CVSS, even a memory leak can be considered as a confidentiality impact if the data is sensitive. However, the description doesn't specify that. So maybe C is None (N) unless there's an assumption. Wait, but the CVSS guidelines might consider memory leaks as a confidentiality issue. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the impact is more on integrity or availability. Wait, the memory leak could lead to denial of service if the system runs out of memory. But the description says it's a potential memory leak, so maybe the impact is on availability. But the question is about the base metrics. Let me check the CVSS definitions again. For confidentiality, it's about unauthorized disclosure of data. If the memory leak is of sensitive data, then C would be High. But the description doesn't specify that. So maybe C is None (N) unless there's an assumption. However, in the absence of specific info, perhaps the default is to assume that a memory leak could lead to confidentiality issues. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the impact is on availability. Wait, the memory leak could lead to resource exhaustion, which affects availability. So A would be High. But the question is about the base metrics. Let me think again. The CVSS base metrics for C, I, A are based on the impact. If the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to data, then C is High. If it allows modification, I is High. If it causes denial of service, A is High. The description says it's a memory leak. So the primary impact is that the system might not free memory, leading to possible resource exhaustion (availability). But the actual impact depends on the context. However, the CVE description doesn't mention any specific data exposure. So maybe C is None (N), I is None (N), and A is High (H). Wait, but the problem is that the memory leak could be exploited to cause a denial of service, which is an availability issue. So A would be High. But the question is about the base metrics. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 definitions again. For example, if the vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a denial of service, then A is High. So in this case, the memory leak could lead to a DoS if the system runs out of memory. Therefore, A is High. But the description doesn't explicitly say that. However, the CVSS scoring requires making assumptions based on the vulnerability's nature. So I think A is High. But what about C and I? If the memory leak doesn't expose data, then C is None. Similarly, if the memory isn't modified, I is None. So C: N, I: N, A: H. Wait, but the user might have different interpretations. Alternatively, maybe the memory leak could be used to read data from the memory, leading to confidentiality. But without explicit info, it's safer to assume that the impact is on availability. So A: H. \n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. Then the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the user's example had C:H, I:H, A:H. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the CVE description. The vulnerability is a memory leak. The fix is to free the memory. If the memory is not freed, it could lead to a denial of service (availability) because the system might run out of memory. So A is High. But confidentiality and integrity? If the memory contains sensitive data, then C could be High. However, the description doesn't mention that. So maybe the answer is C:N, I:N, A:H. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the memory leak could be exploited to read data, leading to C:H. But without explicit info, it's safer to assume that the impact is on availability. So the final vector would be as above. But I need to make sure. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. For example, a memory leak could be considered as a low impact on confidentiality if the data isn't sensitive. But in the absence of specific info, the default is to assume that the impact is on availability. So the answer would be A:H.

Certain error messages could allow Cross-Site Scripting attacks (XSS). for AppSec.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in GitLab. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is related to error messages that could allow XSS. XSS typically occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Since this is a web-based attack, the attack vector is likely Network (N) because the attacker can exploit this from the network, not requiring local access. So AV:N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). For XSS, the complexity is usually low because the attacker doesn't need special tools or knowledge beyond the vulnerability. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) would be None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges to exploit the XSS. They can just inject the script through the error message.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) might be Required (R) if the user has to click on a malicious link or script. However, in some cases, XSS can be exploited without user interaction if the script is automatically executed. But the description mentions error messages, which might require the user to be present to see the error, so maybe UI:R. Wait, but in many XSS cases, the user interaction is required. For example, the user has to be tricked into clicking a link that contains the malicious script. So UI:R. But I need to check. If the error message is displayed to the user, maybe the attacker can inject the script into the error message, and the user's browser executes it when they see the error. So user interaction is required. So UI:R.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to elevate privileges beyond the initial attack. The scope doesn't change; the attack is within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is High (H) because XSS can steal sensitive information like cookies or session tokens, leading to data theft. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I) is High (H) because the attacker could modify the content of the web page, potentially altering data or redirecting users. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A) is None (N) because XSS doesn't directly affect the availability of the service. The service remains operational, but the attack is more about data theft or manipulation.\n\nWait, but I need to double-check each metric. Let me go through again.\n\nAttack Vector: Network (N) because the attack is via the web, so remote.\n\nAttack Complexity: Low (L) because the attacker can exploit it without needing complex steps.\n\nPrivileges Required: None (N) because no authentication is needed.\n\nUser Interaction: Required (R) because the user has to be present to see the error message and execute the script.\n\nScope: Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't allow moving to a different scope.\n\nConfidentiality: High (H) because the attacker can steal data.\n\nIntegrity: High (H) because the attacker can modify data.\n\nAvailability: None (N) because the service isn't disrupted.\n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but some sources might say that for XSS, the UI is not required. Let me think again. If the error message is part of the web application, and the attacker can inject the script into the error message, then the user might be viewing the error message, so the user has to be present. So UI:R. But in some cases, if the error message is automatically generated and the attacker can inject the script into the error message, maybe the user doesn't need to interact. Wait, but XSS typically requires the user to be tricked into clicking a link or visiting a page that contains the malicious script. So in this case, the error message is part of the web application, so the attacker could inject the script into the error message, and when the user sees the error, the script is executed. Therefore, the user interaction is required. So UI:R.\n\nBut I've seen some examples where XSS is considered to have UI:R. So I think that's correct here.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.

In affected versions a user can inject commands via the nmap_cmd parameters. This issue has been addressed in commit `c28e5c8d` and is expected in the next versioned release. Users are advised to filter user input and monitor the project for a new release.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description. The issue is in reNgine, a web app reconnaissance framework. The problem is that a user can inject commands via the nmap_cmd parameters. The fix is in a commit, and they recommend filtering input and waiting for a new release.\n\nSo, the vulnerability is about command injection. Let me break down the metrics one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The user can inject commands via a parameter. Since it's a web application, the attack vector is likely Network (N) because the input is sent over the network, like through HTTP. But wait, if the parameter is part of a request, maybe it's considered Local (L) if the user is authenticated. But the description doesn't mention authentication. The user is just injecting via a parameter, which is typically a network vector. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The attacker needs to have the parameter in the request. If the input is not properly sanitized, the complexity is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need special tools or knowledge beyond sending the request. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user doesn't need any special privileges. The attack can be done by a regular user, so PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any need for user interaction. The injection is done via the parameter, so UI:N.\n\nScope (S): The scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to elevate privileges beyond the initial attack. The attack affects the same component (the web app's processing of the parameter), so S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): If the command injection allows reading sensitive data, then C would be High. But the description doesn't specify that. However, command injection can lead to unauthorized access to data, so maybe C:H. But I need to be careful here. If the command is executed, the attacker could read files, so C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I): If the attacker can modify data, then I would be High. But the description says command injection, which might allow executing arbitrary commands, which could modify data. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A): If the command injection leads to denial of service, then A would be High. But the description doesn't mention that. However, if the command is executed, it could crash the service, so maybe A:H. But again, the description doesn't specify. Hmm. The problem is that the description is vague. The user can inject commands, which could lead to various impacts. But since the CVSS requires us to make the best possible assessment based on the given info, I need to assume the worst case. If the command injection allows for arbitrary code execution, then all three (C, I, A) would be High. But the description doesn't explicitly say that. However, command injection is often considered a high impact because it can lead to full system compromise. So I think C, I, and A are all High.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:H. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. Let me double-check each metric again. Attack Vector is Network because it's via the web. Attack Complexity is Low because no special tools. Privileges None. No user interaction. Scope Unchanged.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a WordPress plugin vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the vulnerability is in the shortcode, and attackers need contributor-level access. Since the attacker has to be authenticated and has access to the site, that suggests the attack vector is Local (L). Because the attacker isn't exploiting something over the network but rather through the local environment, like a logged-in user. So AV:L.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions that the issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps beyond exploiting the input handling. So the complexity is Low (L). AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low privilege level. So PR:L. Wait, but the question says \"authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above\". So the attacker needs to be authenticated, but contributor-level is a low privilege. So PR is Low (L) because it's not requiring high privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a low privilege requirement. So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says the script executes when a user accesses the injected page. So the user has to visit the page, which implies some user interaction. But the question is whether the user interaction is required. The attack requires the user to access the injected page, so UI:Required (R). Wait, but sometimes if the attacker can inject the script and the user just needs to view the page, that's considered requiring user interaction. So UI:R.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The description says it's a stored XSS, so the attacker can inject scripts that execute when users access the page. The scope here is Unchanged (U) because the attack affects the same component (the user's browser accessing the page). Wait, but if the attacker can inject code that affects the same component, then the scope is Unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows injecting scripts, which can steal data. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can read sensitive information. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can inject scripts, which can modify data. So integrity is High (H) because the attacker can alter data. I:H.\n\nAvailability (A). The vulnerability doesn't directly affect availability, unless the script causes a denial of service. But the description doesn't mention that. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the user interaction might be None. Let me check again. The attack requires the user to access the page with the injected script. So the user interaction is required. So UI:R. But sometimes, if the attacker can inject the script and the user just needs to view the page, that's considered requiring user interaction. So UI:R. But maybe the user interaction is not required if the attacker can inject the script and the user's action is just visiting the page. Wait, the CVSS UI metric is whether the user interaction is required for the attack to succeed. If the attacker can inject the script and the user just needs to visit the page, then the user interaction is required. So UI:R. So the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. But I need to make sure. Let me check the exact wording. The description says \"authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the attacker injects the script, and the user has to access the page. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI:R. So the final vector is as above. But wait, sometimes in XSS, if the script is stored and the user just needs to view the page, the UI is required. So yes, UI:R.

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `informacao_adicional.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `descricao` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `informacao_adicional.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed, the malicious payload is executed in the victim's browser, potentially compromising the user's data and system. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.6 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a Stored XSS vulnerability in WeGIA. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in a web application, so the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can exploit it over the network, like through a web request. But wait, the description says it's a stored XSS. Stored XSS means the payload is stored on the server and executed when users access the page. So the attacker doesn't need to be on the same network; they can inject the script via a web request, which is network-based. So AV:N makes sense here.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires the attacker to inject the script into the descricao parameter. The application doesn't validate or sanitize inputs. So the complexity is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need special tools or knowledge beyond knowing the input parameter. It's a straightforward injection without needing to bypass any security measures. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker doesn't need any user privileges to exploit this. They can inject the script from the outside, so PR:N. Even if the user is authenticated, the attacker doesn't need to have any privileges; they just need to find a way to inject the script. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says the script is stored and executed when the page is accessed. The user doesn't need to interact with the payload; it's automatically executed. So UI:N. No user interaction is required.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Since the scope is unchanged (the same component is affected), S:U. Wait, but stored XSS can lead to different impacts. Wait, the scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the attack is on the same component (the web application), the scope is unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The attacker can steal user data via XSS. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can read sensitive information from the victim's browser. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can modify data on the server if they can inject scripts that alter data. But the description says the script is stored and executed when the page is accessed. The stored XSS allows the attacker to inject scripts that can modify data, so integrity is High (H). Wait, but the description says the script is stored and executed, which could allow the attacker to modify data. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A). The vulnerability doesn't directly affect availability. The attacker can't cause denial of service through this method. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Let me double-check each metric again. Yes, that seems right.

A vulnerability has been identified in the ORC C++ LZO decompression logic, where specially crafted malformed ORC files can cause the decompressor to allocate a 250-byte buffer but then attempts to copy 295 bytes into it. It causes memory corruption. This issue affects Apache ORC C++ library: through 1.8.8, from 1.9.0 through 1.9.5, from 2.0.0 through 2.0.4, from 2.1.0 through 2.1.1. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.8.9, 1.9.6, 2.0.5, and 2.1.2, which fix the issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a heap-based buffer overflow in Apache ORC. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the decompression logic, and the issue is triggered by specially crafted ORC files. Since the attacker would need to provide a malformed file, which is typically delivered over a network (like a file download or network service), AV should be Network (N). But wait, if the file is local, maybe it's Local (L)? Hmm. But the description doesn't specify if the file is local or remote. However, buffer overflows in decompression often involve network-based attacks, like a malicious file sent over the network. So I'll go with AV:N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires the attacker to create a specific malformed file. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need special tools or knowledge beyond creating the malformed file. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability is a buffer overflow, which typically doesn't require any prior privileges. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated or have any specific permissions. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description doesn't mention any need for user interaction. The attacker can exploit this by providing the malicious file, which the user might open or process. But if the user has to manually open the file, then UI:R. However, in many cases, such vulnerabilities can be exploited without user interaction if the application processes files automatically. But the CVE description doesn't specify. Wait, the problem says \"specially crafted malformed ORC files can cause the decompressor to...\" So if the application is processing files that the user has uploaded or opened, then UI might be required. But if the application is a service that processes files from the network, maybe UI:N. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. But since the user is recommended to upgrade, and the exploit is via a file, maybe UI:R is possible. Wait, but in many cases, buffer overflows in libraries can be exploited without user interaction if the application is running and the attacker can supply the input. For example, if the application is a server that processes files, the attacker could send the malicious file over the network, and the user doesn't need to interact. So UI:N. I think I'll go with UI:N.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges. Since this is a buffer overflow leading to memory corruption, which could potentially allow code execution, the scope is Changed (C). Because the vulnerability could allow the attacker to gain higher privileges (like executing arbitrary code), which is a change in scope. So S:C.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The buffer overflow could lead to memory disclosure, but the description mentions memory corruption. However, if the attacker can overwrite memory, they might gain access to sensitive data. But the description doesn't specify. However, in many buffer overflow cases, confidentiality can be high if the attacker can read memory. But since the description says \"memory corruption,\" maybe it's not clear. However, the CVSS scoring for confidentiality is high if the vulnerability allows unauthorized disclosure of information. Since the buffer overflow could lead to memory disclosure, I'll assume C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I). The buffer overflow could allow the attacker to modify data structures, leading to arbitrary code execution. So integrity is high (I:H).\n\nAvailability (A). The buffer overflow could lead to a denial of service, as the memory corruption might crash the application. So availability is high (A:H).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:C, C:H, I:H, A:H. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.

This lingering reference comes from a secpath (which holds a ref on the xfrm_state), which is still attached to an skb. This skb is not leaked, it ends up on sk_receive_queue and then gets defer-free'd by skb_attempt_defer_free. The problem happens when we defer freeing an skb (push it on one CPU's defer_list), and don't flush that list before the netns is deleted. In that case, we still have a reference on the xfrm_state that we don't expect at this point. We already drop the skb's dst in the TCP receive path when it's no longer needed, so let's also drop the secpath. At this point, tcp_filter has already called into the LSM hooks that may require the secpath, so it should not be needed anymore. However, in some of those places, the MPTCP extension has just been attached to the skb, so we cannot simply drop all extensions.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to understand the CVE description. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to TCP and secpath handling. The issue is that when deleting a network namespace, a secpath reference isn't properly removed, leading to a lingering reference on an xfrm_state. This could cause issues with resource management, possibly leading to memory leaks or use-after-free scenarios.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, so it's related to system-level code. The problem occurs when deleting a network namespace, which is a system-level operation. However, the attack vector here is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to have local access to the system to delete the network namespace. But wait, the description mentions that the issue arises when the network namespace is deleted. If an attacker can create and delete network namespaces, that's a local attack. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The complexity here is high (H) because the attacker needs to perform specific steps: creating a pair of netns, running a TCP test, deleting the netns. These steps are not trivial and require a certain level of technical knowledge. So AC is High (H).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have local access to the system to perform these actions. However, the vulnerability might not require elevated privileges beyond what a regular user has. Wait, but creating and deleting network namespaces typically requires root privileges. So PR is High (H) because the attacker needs to have elevated privileges to perform these actions. Wait, but the description doesn't explicitly state that. Hmm. If the vulnerability is exploitable by a local user without needing root, then PR would be Low (L). But since network namespace operations usually require root, maybe PR is High (H). But the problem is that the attacker is already in the system, so maybe PR is Low (L) because the attacker is already local. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be root to create and delete netns, then PR is High. But if the vulnerability can be exploited by a local user without needing root, then PR is Low. The description says \"Xiumei reported hitting the WARN in xfrm6_tunnel_net_exit while running tests that boil down to: - create a pair of netns - run a basic TCP test over ipcomp6 - delete the pair of netns\". So the attacker needs to create and delete netns, which typically requires root. Therefore, PR is High (H).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The problem occurs during the deletion of the network namespace. The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The attack is automated, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope is Changed (C) because the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect resources beyond the initial component. For example, the lingering reference could lead to resource leaks or other issues that affect the system's integrity or availability. So S is Changed (C).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability could lead to a situation where the xfrm_state isn't properly released, which might allow an attacker to access data that shouldn't be accessible. However, the description doesn't explicitly mention data exposure. But since the secpath holds a reference to the xfrm_state, which might be related to security policies, there's a potential for confidentiality issues. However, the main issue here is more about resource management. So maybe C is None (N) or Low (L). But if the lingering reference could allow access to sensitive data, then C is High (H). The description says that the xfrm_state is not deleted, which might be part of security policies. So I think C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The issue is about references not being properly released, which could lead to use-after-free or memory corruption. If that's the case, an attacker could potentially modify data structures, leading to integrity issues. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The problem could lead to resource leaks or improper cleanup, which might affect system availability. For example, if the skb is not properly freed, it could lead to memory exhaustion. So A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: High (H)\nPR: High (H)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Changed (C)\nC: High (H)\nI: High (H)\nA: High (H)\n\nNow, the CVSS vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the scope is changed. The scope is Changed (C) because the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect resources beyond the initial component. For example, the attack could lead to a situation where the system's resources are affected, which is a change in scope. So S is C.\n\nBut I need to confirm. The base metrics for CVSS v3.1: Scope (S) is Unchanged (U) if the vulnerability affects the same component, or Changed (C) if it affects a different component. In this case, the vulnerability is in the TCP stack, and the issue is about resource management. If the attack can lead to a different component being affected (like the system's availability), then S is C. So yes, S is C.\n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The issue is in the lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28 where the /bigquery API route doesn't have proper access control. Any logged-in user can create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database, including sensitive data like password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check, but it doesn't verify the user's access level or use access control middleware.\n\nSo, the main points here are that the vulnerability allows any logged-in user to access a sensitive API endpoint, leading to data exposure and potential service disruption. Let's break down each metric.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The API route is accessed over the network, so the attacker would need to send a request to the server. Since the user is logged in, maybe they have some local access? Wait, but the attack is via the API, which is network-based. So AV is Network (N). But wait, if the user is already logged in, does that mean the attack is local? Hmm. Wait, the user is logged in, but the attack is through the API, which is a network service. So the attacker would need to be authenticated (since the user is logged in) but the attack vector is still network-based. So AV is Network (N). Or is it Local (L) because the user is already authenticated? Wait, the attack vector is how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is a logged-in user, they can access the API via the network. So AV is Network (N) because the attack is over the network, even though the user is authenticated. So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability doesn't require any additional steps beyond being logged in. The config check is there but doesn't verify access levels. So the attack is straightforward. So AC is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps. They just need to be logged in and send a request to the API.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The user needs to be logged in, so the attacker must have some level of authentication. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since the user is already logged in, the attacker has the necessary privileges. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated, which is a low privilege requirement. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already authenticated, then they have the necessary privileges. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have a valid account (which is a low privilege requirement). Wait, but maybe the PR is None (N) if the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges beyond being logged in. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already logged in, then they have the necessary privileges. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have a valid account (which is a low privilege requirement). Or is it None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to have any specific privileges beyond being authenticated? Hmm, the PR metric is defined as the level of privileges required for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already authenticated, then they have the necessary privileges. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have a valid account (which is a low privilege requirement). Wait, but maybe the PR is None (N) if the attacker doesn't need to have any specific privileges beyond being authenticated. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already authenticated, then they have the necessary privileges. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have a valid account (which is a low privilege requirement). Alternatively, maybe the PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to have any specific privileges beyond being logged in. Wait, the PR metric is defined as the level of privileges required for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already logged in, then they have the necessary privileges. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have a valid account (which is a low privilege requirement). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS definitions. PR is the level of privileges required for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, then PR is Low (L). If the attacker needs to be a privileged user (like admin), then it's High (H). In this case, the attacker just needs to be logged in, which is a low privilege requirement. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says that any logged-in user can exploit this. So the user doesn't need to interact with the system beyond being logged in. The attack can be automated. So UI is None (N) because no user interaction is required beyond the initial login.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. The vulnerability allows the attacker to access the database and export data, which is the same component (the application's data). So the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the attacker can export the entire database, which includes sensitive data, but the scope is about whether the attack affects a different component. Since the attack is on the same component (the application's data), the scope is Unchanged (U). So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows the extraction of sensitive data like password hashes and secret API keys. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can read sensitive information.\n\nIntegrity (I). The vulnerability allows the attacker to export data, but does it allow modification? The description mentions disruption of services and service integrity breaches. So the attacker can modify the data (like exporting it, which might be considered as modifying the data's integrity if they can alter it). Wait, the description says \"disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches.\" So the attacker can cause integrity issues by exporting data, which might be considered as modifying the data's integrity. But the main point is that the attacker can export the entire database, which is a data integrity issue. Wait, but the integrity metric is about the ability to modify data. If the attacker can export data, that's more about confidentiality. However, the description mentions \"disruption of services\" and \"service integrity breaches,\" which might imply that the attacker can alter the data or the system's state. So maybe Integrity is High (H). But I need to be careful. The main issue here is that the attacker can access sensitive data (confidentiality), but the integrity aspect is about whether the attacker can modify data. The description says \"export the entire database,\" which is more about reading data, not modifying. However, the mention of \"disruption of services\" and \"service integrity breaches\" might imply that the attacker can cause the system to behave incorrectly, which could be an integrity issue. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The main impact here is that the attacker can access sensitive data (confidentiality), which is High. For integrity, if the attacker can modify data, then it's High. But in this case, the attacker is exporting data, which is a read operation. Unless the export process allows the attacker to alter the data, which isn't mentioned. So maybe Integrity is None (N) or Low (L). Wait, the description says \"disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches.\" The service integrity breaches could mean that the attacker can cause the service to behave incorrectly, which might be an integrity issue. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the integrity is not directly affected. So perhaps I should consider that the main impact is confidentiality. But the problem is that the CVSS metrics are separate. So for the integrity metric, if the attacker can modify data, then I is High. If not, then it's None or Low. Since the description doesn't mention the attacker modifying data, but rather exporting it, which is a read, then Integrity might be None (N). However, the mention of \"service integrity breaches\" is a bit ambiguous. Maybe the attacker can cause the service to be disrupted, which could be considered as an availability issue. Wait, the availability is about the ability to deny service. So maybe the disruption of services is under availability. So for integrity, if the attacker can't modify data, then I is None (N). But the description says \"service integrity breaches,\" which might imply that the attacker can alter the data's integrity. But without more info, it's safer to assume that the main impact is confidentiality. So I would set I to None (N) unless there's a clear indication of data modification. But the problem is that the description mentions \"disruption of services\" which is more about availability. So maybe the integrity is not affected. So I: N. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the attacker can export the data, which could be considered as modifying the data's integrity if the data is being altered. But that's not clear. Let me check the CVSS definitions again. The Integrity metric is the ability to modify data. If the attacker can modify data, then I is High. If not, then it's None. Since the attacker is exporting data, which is a read, not a write, then I is None (N). So I: N.\n\nAvailability (A). The description mentions \"disruption of services,\" which could be an availability issue. If the attacker can cause the service to be disrupted, then A is High (H). But the exact impact is not clear. However, the main point is that the attacker can export the entire database, which might not directly affect availability.

This is to prevent a possible integer underflow that might happen when copying the source scatterlist into a linear buffer.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a Linux kernel vulnerability related to the crypto module. The issue is an integer underflow when handling DH Reject requests with a source buffer larger than the key size. I need to determine each base metric and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is a system-level component. If an attacker can exploit this remotely, it would be Network (N). But wait, the description mentions a source buffer that's bigger than the key size. How is this exploited? If the buffer is part of a network request, then AV:N. But if it's a local exploit, like through a local user, then AV:L. The description doesn't specify, but since it's a kernel vulnerability, it's possible that it's exploitable via a local user. Wait, but the fix is about a buffer size check. If the attacker is local, they can create a buffer that's too big. But maybe the vulnerability is exploitable remotely. Hmm. The description says \"source buffer that is bigger than the size of the key.\" If the buffer is part of a network packet, then AV:N. But if it's a local buffer, then AV:L. The CVE is in the crypto module, which might be accessed via network. But without more info, I need to make an educated guess. Since it's a kernel vulnerability, maybe it's local. But sometimes kernel issues can be exploited remotely. Let me think. The underflow occurs when copying a scatterlist into a linear buffer. If the attacker can control the buffer size, maybe through a network request, then AV:N. But if it's a local exploit, like a user with local access, then AV:L. The description doesn't specify, but the fix is for a buffer that's bigger than the key size. If the buffer is part of a network request, then AV:N. But I'm not sure. Maybe the default assumption is that kernel vulnerabilities are local unless stated otherwise. So I'll go with AV:L. Wait, but the user might have to be local to exploit it. So AV:L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability requires the attacker to create a buffer that's larger than the key size. This would be a low complexity because the attacker doesn't need to have any special tools or steps beyond providing the oversized buffer. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have some level of access. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, maybe the attacker needs to be a local user with some privileges. But if it's a privilege escalation, then PR:H. But the description doesn't mention privilege escalation. It's about an integer underflow when copying data. If the attacker is local, they might not need elevated privileges. So PR:N. Wait, but if the attacker is local, they might already have user privileges. So PR:N. Unless the exploit requires root access. The description doesn't say, so I'll assume PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability doesn't require user interaction. The attacker can trigger it by sending a malformed request. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability affects different components. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges (like from user to root), then scope is changed. But the description doesn't mention that. It's about an integer underflow in the crypto module. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to read or modify data, but not escalate privileges, then scope is unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): If the underflow leads to data disclosure, then C:H. But the description says it's to prevent an integer underflow that might happen when copying the source scatterlist into a linear buffer. If the buffer is larger, maybe the underflow could lead to reading memory beyond the intended area, which could leak data. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I): If the underflow allows the attacker to modify data, then I:H. But the description doesn't mention that. It's about copying data, so maybe the integrity isn't directly affected. Unless the underflow allows overwriting data. But the description doesn't specify. So maybe I:N. Wait, but the underflow could lead to arbitrary memory writes, which would affect integrity. But without more info, it's safer to assume that the vulnerability might not directly affect integrity. However, the fix is to prevent an underflow, which could lead to buffer overflows, which can affect integrity. So maybe I:H. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The underflow when copying data could lead to overwriting memory, which could allow the attacker to modify data structures, leading to integrity issues. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A): If the underflow causes a crash or denial of service, then A:H. The description mentions an integer underflow that might happen when copying data. If that leads to a crash, then A:H. But the description doesn't explicitly say that. However, the fix is to prevent the underflow, which could be a DoS. So A:H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:L (Local), AC:L (Low), PR:N (None), UI:N (None), S:U (Unchanged), C:H (High), I:H (High), A:H (High). \n\nWait, but earlier I considered AV:L. But maybe the attack vector is Network. Let me recheck. The vulnerability is in the crypto module. If the attacker sends a network request with a buffer that's too big, then AV:N. But if the attacker is local, then AV:L. The description doesn't specify, but the fix is for a buffer that's bigger than the key size. If the buffer is part of a network packet, then AV:N. But if it's a local buffer, then AV:L. Since the CVE is in the Linux kernel, which is a system component, it's possible that the vulnerability is exploitable via a local user. However, sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely. But without more info, I think the default assumption is that it's local. So AV:L. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example answer has AV:N. Wait, the example given in the problem is for a different CVE, but the user's example shows AV:N. But in this case, the user's CVE is about a buffer size check. If the buffer is part of a network request, then AV:N. But if it's a local buffer, then AV:L. Since the description doesn't specify, but the fix is for a buffer that's bigger than the key size, which could be part of a network request. For example, if the DH Reject request is sent over the network, then the attacker could send a buffer that's too big. So AV:N. That makes more sense. So I should adjust AV to N. \n\nSo revising:\n\nAV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:N (None), UI:N (None), S:U (Unchanged), C:H (High), I:H (High), A:H (High). \n\nBut why would the attack vector be network? Because the DH Reject request is part of a network protocol. So the attacker can send a malformed packet over the network. Therefore, AV:N. That makes sense. So the initial assumption was wrong. So AV:N.\n\nSo the final vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. \n\nBut I need to confirm each metric again. \n\nAttack Vector (AV): Network (N) because the vulnerability is in a network-related component (DH Reject requests). \n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L) because the attacker just needs to provide a buffer larger than the key size. \n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges. \n\nUser Interaction (UI): None (N) because the attack can be automated. \n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't allow privilege escalation. \n\nConfidentiality (C): High (H) because the underflow could lead to data disclosure. \n\nIntegrity (I): High (H) because the underflow could allow modification of data. \n\nAvailability (A): High (H) because the underflow could cause a crash or DoS. \n\nSo the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 4.300000000000001, "success": true}

This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-4166, is fixed in Vault Community 1.19.3 and Vault Enterprise 1.19.3, 1.18.9, 1.17.16, 1.16.20.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description, and I need to figure out each of the base metrics. Let me start by understanding the vulnerability described.\n\nThe CVE is about Vault's kv version 2 plugin exposing sensitive info in server and audit logs when users send malformed payloads during secret creation or updates via the REST API. The fix is in specific versions. \n\nFirst, I need to determine each metric. Let's go step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is triggered via the REST API. Since the API is accessible over the network, the attack vector is Network (N). So AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says it's unintentionally exposing info. The attacker doesn't need to perform any complex steps; it's a flaw in handling malformed payloads. So Attack Complexity is Low (L). AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges. They just need to send a malformed payload. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered by the user submitting a malformed payload. But the user interaction is not required beyond that. Wait, the description says \"when users submit malformed payloads\". So the user has to perform the action, but the attack doesn't require any interaction beyond that. However, in CVSS, UI is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any user interaction, then UI:N. But if the user has to do something, like click a link, then UI:R. Here, the user is submitting the payload, which is part of normal operation. So maybe UI:N. But I need to check. The attack is via the REST API, which is a normal operation. So the user is the one initiating the request. But the attack doesn't require any interaction beyond that. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kv plugin, and the impact is on the same component (exposing logs), the scope is Unchanged (U). So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability exposes sensitive information in logs. So confidentiality is High (H). C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I): The logs are being exposed, but the integrity of the system isn't directly affected. The logs themselves might be tampered with, but the description says it's unintentionally exposing, not modifying. So Integrity is None (N). Wait, but if the logs are being exposed, does that affect integrity? Or is it about the data being exposed? Wait, the logs are part of the system's data. If the logs are exposed, that's a confidentiality issue. Integrity would be about the system's data being modified. Since the logs are being exposed, not modified, I think Integrity is N. So I:N.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't directly impact availability. It's about exposure of data, not causing denial of service. So A:N.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check again. The logs are being exposed, but the availability is about the system's availability. Since the logs are just being logged, not causing the system to crash or be unavailable, A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nWait, but the user might have a different take on Integrity. Let me think again. If the logs are being exposed, does that affect the integrity of the system? Or is it a confidentiality issue? The logs are part of the system's data. If the logs are exposed, that's a confidentiality issue. Integrity would be if the logs are modified. Since the logs are being exposed, not modified, I think Integrity is N. So I:N.\n\nSo the vector would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\nBut wait, the answer example in the prompt has C:H, I:H, A:H. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nThe vulnerability is about exposing sensitive information. That's a confidentiality issue. So C:H. What about integrity? If the logs are being exposed, does that affect the integrity of the system? Or is it just that the logs are being read by unauthorized users? The logs themselves are not being modified, so integrity isn't affected. So I:N. Availability is not affected, so A:N.\n\nSo the final vector is as above. But maybe the user considers that the logs being exposed could be a part of the system's data, so maybe I:N. Alternatively, if the logs are being tampered with, but the description says it's unintentionally exposing, so not tampering. So I:N.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 1.0, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a WordPress plugin vulnerability. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the vulnerability is in the forgot-password shortcode, and attackers need contributor-level access. Since the attacker has to be authenticated and have access to the site, that suggests the attack is via the local network, right? Because they need to be logged in and have access to the WordPress site. So AV should be Local (L). Wait, but sometimes if it's through a plugin, maybe it's adjacent? Hmm. Wait, the description says \"authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above\" can exploit it. So they need to be logged in, which implies they're on the same network or have local access. So AV is Local (L). But wait, maybe it's Network (N) if the attacker can exploit it remotely. Wait, no. The vulnerability is in a shortcode that's part of the plugin. So the attacker has to be logged in, so it's local. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The description mentions insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The attacker doesn't need to do anything complex, just inject the script. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low privilege level. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but the question says PR options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). Contributor-level access is considered a low privilege? Or maybe High? Wait, in CVSS, PR is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have contributor access, which is a role that's not admin, but still has some privileges. But in terms of CVSS, PR is about the level of access required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, then PR is Low (L) because it's not requiring admin privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have contributor access, which is a specific role, but in terms of the CVSS, PR is categorized as Low (L) if the attacker needs to have some level of access, but not necessarily admin. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says the attacker can inject scripts that execute when a user accesses the page. So the user has to visit the injected page. That implies that user interaction is required. Wait, but the attacker injects the script, and then the user has to click on the link or visit the page. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but sometimes if the script is automatically executed when the page is loaded, maybe UI is None. But the description says \"execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the user has to access the page, which requires their interaction. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but maybe the user doesn't need to interact beyond just visiting the page. Wait, the CVSS UI metric is whether the user interaction is required. If the attack requires the user to take some action (like clicking a link), then UI is Required. If the attack is automatic, then UI is None. In this case, the attacker injects the script, and when a user accesses the page, the script runs. So the user has to access the page, which is part of their normal browsing. So maybe UI is None (N)? Wait, but the attacker has to have the user visit the page. So the user interaction is required. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me check. The CVSS UI metric is \"User interaction is required for the attack to succeed.\" If the attack requires the user to take some action, like clicking a link, then UI is R. If the attack is automatic, like the script runs when the page is loaded, then UI is N. In this case, the attacker injects the script into a page, and when a user accesses that page, the script runs. So the user doesn't need to take any action beyond visiting the page. So maybe UI is None (N). Wait, but the user is the one accessing the page. So the user is interacting with the page. But the attack is that the user is being tricked into visiting the page. So the user interaction is required. Wait, but the user is not interacting with the attack itself. The attack is that the attacker injects the script, and the user's access to the page is what triggers the script. So the user's interaction is required. Therefore, UI is Required (R). Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think again. The CVSS UI metric is whether the user interaction is required. If the attack requires the user to take some action (like clicking a link), then UI is R. If the attack is automatic, like the script runs when the page is loaded, then UI is N. In this case, the user is visiting the page, which is part of their normal activity. So the user doesn't need to take any action beyond that. Therefore, UI is None (N). Wait, but the user is the one who is being targeted. So the attacker has to get the user to access the page. So the user interaction is required. But the user is not interacting with the attack; they are just accessing the page. So maybe UI is None (N). I'm a bit confused here. Let me check some examples. For example, a stored XSS where the user is tricked into visiting a page with the payload. In that case, the user interaction is required. So UI is R. Because the user has to click on a link or visit the page. So in this case, the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI is Required (R). So I'll go with UI: Required (R).\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new vulnerability that affects a different component. The description says that the attacker can inject scripts that execute when a user accesses the page. This is a confidentiality and integrity issue, but the scope is unchanged because the attack is within the same component (the plugin). So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C). The attacker can inject scripts, which can steal data. So confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can modify the page content, so integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A). The vulnerability doesn't mention anything about denial of service, so availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) - because the attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the site.\nAC: Low (L) - no complex steps needed.\nPR: Low (L) - requires contributor access, which is a low privilege level.\nUI: Required (R) - user has to access the injected page.\nS: Unchanged (U) - same component.\nC: High (H) - data can be stolen.\nI: High (H) - content can be modified.\nA: None (N) - no availability impact.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought UI might be N. Let me double-check. If the user is required to access the page, then UI is R. But if the script is automatically executed when the page is loaded, then maybe UI is N. But the user has to be tricked into visiting the page, which is a form of user interaction. So UI is R. So the answer should have UI:R.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 1.1999999999999993, "success": true}

First, I need to parse the CVE description and map each part to the base metrics. The description says the vulnerability is in Tenda AC23's API Interface, specifically in the /goform/VerAPIMant file. The issue is that manipulating the 'getuid' argument leads to a denial of service. The attack can be initiated remotely, and the exploit is public.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions the attack may be initiated remotely. So AV should be Network (N) because the attacker doesn't need physical access or local access. \n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC).

The user provided a CVE description about a Stored XSS vulnerability in a WordPress plugin. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is via a shortcode, which is part of the plugin. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated and have contributor-level access, that suggests the attack is happening through the application's interface, which is local. But wait, the user is authenticated, so maybe it's Local (L)? Or is it Network (N)? Wait, the description says \"authenticated attackers with contributor-level access\" so they have to be logged in.

In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it is possible for any authenticated user, through the use of the filemanager to delete any file owned by the user running the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) on the host without any limitation on the filesystem's scope. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to arbitrarily remove content from the Wiki resulting in partial loss of data and defacement/deterioration of the website. In the context of a container installation of YesWiki without any modification, the `yeswiki` files (for example .php) are not owned by the same user (root) as the one running the FPM process (www-data). However in a standard installation, www-data may also be the owner of the PHP files, allowing a malicious user to completely cut the access to the wiki by deleting all important PHP files (like index.php or core files of YesWiki). Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for this issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in YesWiki versions up to 4.4.5. The issue allows any authenticated user to delete any file owned by the FPM process user (like www-data) via the filemanager. This can lead to data loss and website defacement.\n\nStarting with the base metrics. Let's go step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The user can exploit this through the filemanager, which is part of the application. Since the user is authenticated, but the attack is done via the application's interface, I think AV is Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated and access the filemanager. Wait, but the filemanager is part of the application, so maybe it's considered a local attack. Alternatively, if the filemanager is accessible over the network, maybe Network (N). But the description says \"any authenticated user\" can do this, implying they are already logged in. So AV is Local (L) because the attack is done through the application's interface, which is local to the user's session.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The attack requires the user to have access to the filemanager and be authenticated. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need special tools or steps beyond being authenticated. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user needs to be authenticated, which is a low privilege requirement. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but the description says \"any authenticated user\" can do this. So the attacker needs to have an account, which is a low privilege requirement. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The user has to be authenticated, but the attack doesn't require any additional interaction beyond that. The user can perform the action once authenticated. So UI is None (N) because the attack can be done without further user interaction once authenticated.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability affects a different component. The attack deletes files owned by the FPM user, which could be different from the user's own files. However, the scope here is unchanged because the attack is within the same component (the filemanager). Wait, the scope is about whether the attack affects a different component. If the attack allows the attacker to delete files that are part of the same system, then the scope is Unchanged (U). But if the attack allows the attacker to affect a different component (like the server's files), then it's Changed (C). The description mentions that in a container setup, the files are owned by www-data, which is different from the user. So the attack can affect other components (like the server's files), which would change the scope. Therefore, Scope (S) is Changed (C).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can delete files, which could lead to loss of data. However, confidentiality is about unauthorized disclosure. Since the attacker is deleting files, not reading them, confidentiality isn't directly affected. So C is None (N). Wait, but the description says \"partial loss of data\" and \"defacement\". Defacement might involve altering data, which affects integrity. But confidentiality is about data being read. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can delete files, which can alter the system's integrity. So I is High (H) because the attacker can modify or delete files, leading to loss of integrity.\n\nAvailability (A): Deleting critical files like index.php or core files would make the wiki inaccessible, which affects availability. So A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) - because the attack is done through the application's interface, requiring authentication.\nAC: Low (L) - no complex steps needed.\nPR: Low (L) - requires authentication.\nUI: None (N) - no further interaction needed.\nS: Changed (C) - affects different components (server files).\nC: None (N) - no data disclosure.\nI: High (H) - data can be deleted, affecting integrity.\nA: High (H) - service disruption via file deletion.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the scope is correct. The scope is Changed (C) because the attack can affect other components (like the server's files) beyond the user's own data. So yes, S is C. That makes sense. So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H", "score": 1.3000000000000007, "success": true}

The user provided a CVE description about a privacy issue where an app might see a contact's phone number in system logs. The fix is in macOS Sequoia 15.3, iOS 18.3, and iPadOS 18.3.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The issue is about system logs. If an app can access logs, that's typically a local attack because the app is already running on the device. So AV should be Local (L). Wait, but maybe someone could exploit this through network? Hmm, the logs are part of the system, so an attacker would need local access. So AV is Local.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says the app may be able to view the phone number. Is this a low or high complexity? If the attacker needs to have the app installed and access the logs, maybe it's low complexity because it's a straightforward access. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have the app installed, which is a local app. So PR is None (N) because the app is already running and has access to the system. Wait, but maybe the app needs to have certain permissions. However, the description doesn't mention any specific privileges beyond being an app. So PR is None.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The issue is about viewing logs. If the app can do this without any user interaction, then UI is None (N). But maybe the user has to enable something? The description doesn't mention that, so UI is None.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the issue is about viewing logs, which is part of the same component (the app accessing logs), the scope is Unchanged (U). So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The issue is about viewing private data (phone number). So confidentiality is High (H) because the data is sensitive and being exposed.\n\nIntegrity (I): The problem doesn't mention any modification of data, just viewing. So Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): No mention of denial of service or affecting availability. So Availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Wait, but the example given in the problem had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I made a mistake with Integrity. Let me check again. The problem says the app may view a contact's phone number. So that's confidentiality. Integrity would be if the data was modified. Since the issue is about viewing, not altering, I is N. Availability is also not affected. So the vector is correct as above. But wait, the example in the problem's final line had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, maybe I need to check again. The user's example was Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.

The CVE is about a Stored XSS vulnerability in a WordPress plugin. First, I need to figure out each of the base metrics.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). Since it's a web-based vulnerability, the attacker would need to send the malicious payload through the web interface. So AV is Network (N) because the attack can be delivered over the network, like via a web request.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to perform any special steps to exploit the vulnerability. Just injecting the script into the web page would be sufficient, so complexity is low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior access or privileges. They can exploit this from a remote user account, so no special privileges are needed.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is Required (R) because the user has to click on the malicious content. For Stored XSS, the attacker stores the payload, and the user has to interact with the page to trigger the script. So UI is Required.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to elevate privileges or access other systems. The scope remains within the same component, so the scope is unchanged.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is High (H) because the attacker can steal sensitive information from the user's session or cookies. Since it's XSS, the attacker can access the user's data if they are authenticated.\n\nIntegrity (I) is High (H) because the attacker can modify the content of the web page, potentially altering data or defacing the site. The user's data or the site's content could be changed.\n\nAvailability (A) is None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't directly impact the availability of the service.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation and sanitization of user input in SVG markdown support within the chatbot feature. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SVG content, which can execute arbitrary JavaScript code when viewed by an admin, potentially leading to credential theft.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a stored XSS vulnerability in langgenius/dify. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, let's recall the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. The ones mentioned are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means the attacker needs to have some way to inject the malicious code. Since it's a stored XSS, the attacker would need to have access to the application's user input, which is typically a local attack. But wait, the description says the attacker can inject malicious SVG content that executes when viewed by an admin. So the attack vector here is local because the attacker has to be authenticated as a user to inject the content. Wait, but maybe the admin is a user with access. So AV would be Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated to inject the payload. But wait, sometimes stored XSS can be exploited remotely if the attacker can get the victim to view the malicious content. But in this case, the attacker injects the SVG into the chatbot feature, which is then viewed by an admin. So the attack vector is local because the attacker has to be logged in as a user to inject the content. So AV is Local (L). Wait, but maybe the admin is a different user. Hmm. Let me think again. If the attacker can inject the SVG into the system, which is then viewed by an admin, that might be considered a local attack because the attacker is interacting with the application's user interface. But if the admin is a different user, maybe the attack vector is network? Wait, no. Stored XSS typically requires the attacker to have access to the application's user input, which is usually local. So AV is Local (L).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is due to improper validation and sanitization. The attacker needs to inject the SVG content, which is a single step. Since the attacker can exploit this without needing additional steps, the complexity is Low (L). So AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to be authenticated to inject the content. Since the admin is a user, the attacker must have some level of access. But the description says \"an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SVG content, which can execute when viewed by an admin\". So the attacker needs to be authenticated as a user to inject the payload. Therefore, PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have user privileges to inject the content. Wait, but if the attacker is an admin, maybe they already have high privileges. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated to inject the payload, then PR is Low (L). Because the attacker needs to have some level of access (like a user account) to perform the attack. So PR is Low.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is stored, so the attacker's payload is stored and then executed when the admin views the content. The user interaction here is not required because the admin just needs to view the content. So UI is None (N). Because the attack doesn't require any user interaction beyond the initial injection. Wait, but the admin has to view the content. But the user interaction metric refers to whether the user (victim) needs to interact with the exploit. In this case, the admin is the one viewing the content, so the attacker doesn't need to trick the admin into clicking anything. The payload is already stored, so the admin just needs to view the content. Therefore, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new vulnerability that affects a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the chatbot feature, and the attack leads to credential theft, which is a different component (like the admin's session), the scope is Changed (C). Because the attack can affect a different component (the admin's credentials) than the one being exploited. So S is Changed.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows the attacker to steal credentials, which is a high confidentiality impact. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript, which could modify data. However, the description mentions credential theft, which is more about confidentiality. But if the attacker can execute JS, they might be able to alter data. However, the description doesn't explicitly mention data modification. So maybe I is None (N) or Low (L). Wait, the question says \"potentially leading to credential theft\". So the main impact is confidentiality. But the integrity could be low if the attacker can't modify data. However, if the attacker can execute JS, they might be able to manipulate the UI or data. But the description doesn't specify. Since the main impact is credential theft, which is confidentiality, maybe I is None. But I need to check. The CVSS metrics are about the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. If the attacker can execute JS, they might be able to modify data, so I could be High. But the description doesn't mention that. Hmm. The problem says \"potentially leading to credential theft\", which is C. So maybe I is None. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The vulnerability is stored XSS, which allows the attacker to inject code that runs in the context of the admin. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, which is confidentiality. But if the attacker can modify the admin's session, that's integrity. However, the description doesn't mention that. So maybe I is None. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the attacker can modify the admin's data, so I is High. But the description doesn't specify. Since the problem states \"credential theft\", which is C, perhaps I is None. But I need to make a choice here. Let me check the standard for XSS. Typically, stored XSS can lead to confidentiality (stealing cookies) and integrity (modifying data). But the description only mentions credential theft. So maybe I is None. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the attacker can modify the admin's data, so I is High. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example answer has C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, the example given in the problem's final line is Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. But that's just an example. So in our case, the user's description says \"credential theft\", which is C. But the attacker could also modify data, so I could be High. However, the problem says \"potentially leading to credential theft\", so maybe the main impact is C. But the problem might expect that the attacker can also modify data, so I is High. Alternatively, maybe the attacker can't modify data, so I is None. This is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in SVG markdown support within the chatbot feature. If the attacker injects malicious SVG, which executes JS when viewed by an admin. The JS could be used to steal credentials (C), but also could be used to modify data (I). However, the description doesn't mention data modification. So maybe I is None. But I'm not sure. Let me check the standard. In CVSS, for XSS, the impact is usually considered as high for confidentiality (C:H) and integrity (I:H) if the attacker can modify data. But if the attacker can't modify data, then I is None. Since the problem states \"credential theft\", which is C, but the attacker could also modify data. However, the problem doesn't mention that. So maybe I is None. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the attacker can modify the admin's data, so I is High. Hmm. Let me proceed with I as High, since the attacker can execute arbitrary JS, which could lead to modifying data. So I is High.\n\nAvailability (A). The vulnerability doesn't mention any impact on availability. So A is None (N).\n\nNow, let me summarize all the metrics:\n\nAV: Local (L) - because the attacker needs to be authenticated to inject the payload.\nAC: Low (L) - the attack is straightforward.\nPR: Low (L) - the attacker needs to have user privileges to inject the content.\nUI: None (N) - no user interaction required beyond the initial injection.\nS: Changed (C) - the attack affects a different component (admin's credentials).\nC: High (H) - credential theft.\nI: High (H) - attacker can execute JS, which could modify data.\nA: None (N) - no impact on availability.\n\nWait, but earlier I was confused about S. Let me check again. The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to create a new vulnerability that affects a different component. In this case, the attacker exploits the chatbot feature (which is part of the application) and then can steal the admin's credentials. The admin's credentials are part of the same component (the application's user account). So maybe the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, the scope is Changed (C) if the attack affects a different component. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain access to another component, like the database, then it's Changed. But in this case, the attacker is exploiting the chatbot feature (part of the application) and then can steal the admin's credentials, which is part of the same component. So the scope is Unchanged (U).

The user provided a CVE description about a null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel related to SUNRPC and sysfs allocation. I need to determine each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each metric one by one. \n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is a system-level component. The issue occurs when the sysfs allocation fails. Since sysfs is a filesystem used for kernel modules, and the vulnerability is triggered when the system is running, the attack vector is likely Local (L). Because an attacker would need to have local access to the system to exploit this, right? Unless there's a way to trigger it remotely, but the description doesn't mention that. So AV is Local.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability requires that the xps sysfs allocation fails. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any special steps beyond the allocation failure. It's a straightforward condition, so AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The problem is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have some level of access. However, the description doesn't mention needing elevated privileges. Since it's a null pointer dereference, maybe it's exploitable without any privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability seems to be triggered by the system's normal operation, like when the sysfs allocation fails. There's no mention of needing user interaction, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The scope refers to whether the vulnerability affects resources beyond those of the component. Since the issue is in the kernel and the exploit could lead to system-wide issues, but the description doesn't mention changing the scope. The original component is the kernel, and the impact is on the system's availability. So Scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference, which could lead to a crash or denial of service. However, it doesn't directly expose confidential data. So Confidentiality is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the issue doesn't directly affect the integrity of data. It's more about causing a crash. So Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability could cause a system crash or denial of service when the sysfs allocation fails. That would impact availability. So Availability is High (H).\n\nWait, but the description says that when the xps sysfs alloc failed, the system might null-ptr-deref, leading to a crash. So that's a denial of service, which affects availability. So A is High.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. \n\nWait, but the user might have different interpretations. Let me double-check. For example, if the attack vector is Local, but maybe the sysfs is accessible via a local user. But the kernel is a system component, so local access is required. So AV is Local. \n\nAnother point: the scope. If the vulnerability allows an attacker to gain higher privileges, then scope would be Changed. But the description doesn't mention that. The issue is a null pointer dereference, which is a crash, so the scope remains unchanged. So S:U.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. \n\nBut wait, the example given in the problem has C:H, I:H, A:H. But in this case, the vulnerability is a null pointer dereference leading to a crash. So the impact on availability is High. But confidentiality and integrity are not affected. So C:N, I:N, A:H. \n\nYes, that seems correct.

So handle this cases and avoid a NULL pointer derefence in vchiq_dump_platform_instances.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a NULL pointer dereference in the Linux kernel's vchiq_arm module. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is a system-level component. If an attacker can exploit this, they might need to be in a local context, like a user with local access. But wait, the description mentions that the function can return a NULL pointer, so maybe the attack is local. But sometimes, kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger the issue. However, the description doesn't mention any network-based exploitation. So I think AV is Local (L) because the vulnerability is in the kernel, which is typically accessed locally. But wait, maybe it's adjacent? No, adjacent is for devices on the same network. Since it's a kernel module, the attack vector is likely Local. So AV:L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires handling a NULL pointer. The fix is to check for NULL before dereferencing. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform any special steps beyond triggering the function. So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker would need to have local access to the kernel module. Since it's a kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need to be a local user with some privileges. But the description doesn't specify if it's a privilege escalation. The original issue is a NULL deref, which might be exploitable without needing elevated privileges. So PR:N. Wait, but if the attacker is already in the kernel context, maybe they don't need any privileges. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability doesn't require user interaction. The issue is a code flaw that can be triggered by an input, but the description doesn't mention needing user input. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability affects a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on the system's integrity or availability, but the scope here is unchanged. Wait, the scope is Changed (C) if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges or affect a different component. But in this case, the vulnerability is a NULL deref, which could lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution. If the attacker can exploit this, they might gain elevated privileges, which would change the scope. However, the description doesn't mention that. The original issue is a NULL deref, which might not change the scope. So S:U. Wait, but if the vulnerability allows for code execution, that would change the scope. But the description doesn't specify that. So maybe S:U. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The scope is Changed if the attack can affect a different component. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attacker can exploit it to gain root access, that would change the scope. But the description doesn't mention that. So maybe the scope is Unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. If the attacker can trigger this, it might lead to a crash, but not necessarily leaking data. So C:N. Unless the crash could be used to read memory, but the description doesn't mention that. So C:N.\n\nIntegrity (I). If the NULL deref can be exploited to modify data, then I would be High. But again, the description doesn't specify. However, a NULL deref could lead to arbitrary code execution, which would allow modifying data. But without more info, maybe I:N. Wait, but the fix is to avoid the NULL deref. If the vulnerability is a crash, then maybe I:N. But if the crash can be exploited to gain control, then I:H. But the description doesn't mention that. So maybe I:N.\n\nAvailability (A). A NULL deref could cause a denial of service, leading to system crash. So A:H. Because the vulnerability could lead to a crash, making the system unavailable.\n\nWait, but the original description says \"avoid NULL ptr deref in vchiq_dump_platform_instances\". So the vulnerability is a potential crash. So the impact on availability is High. So A:H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:L (Local), AC:L (Low complexity), PR:N (No privileges), UI:N (No interaction), S:U (Unchanged scope), C:N (No confidentiality), I:N (No integrity), A:H (High availability).\n\nWait, but if the scope is Unchanged, then the impact metrics (C, I, A) are based on the same component. If the vulnerability is a crash, then availability is High. So the vector would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nBut I need to check each metric again. Let me verify each step.\n\nAttack Vector: Local (L) because it's a kernel module, so local access.\n\nAttack Complexity: Low (L) because the attacker just needs to trigger the function, no complex steps.\n\nPrivileges Required: None (N) because the attacker needs local access, but the PR metric is about privileges required to exploit. If the attacker is already local, then PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction: None (N) because the vulnerability can be triggered without user interaction.\n\nScope: Unchanged (U) because the attack doesn't change the scope (same component).\n\nConfidentiality: None (N) because no data is leaked.\n\nIntegrity: None (N) because no data modification is mentioned.\n\nAvailability: High (H) because the crash would affect availability.\n\nSo the vector is as above. But wait, sometimes for kernel vulnerabilities, the scope might be Changed if the attack can lead to privilege escalation. But the description doesn't mention that.

While reading icmp sysctl variables, they can be changed concurrently. So, we need to add READ_ONCE() to avoid data-races.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The user provided a CVE description about a data race in the Linux kernel's icmp sysctl variables. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is a system-level component. Data races can be exploited through local access, right? Because the sysctl variables are part of the kernel, so an attacker would need local access to exploit this. So AV should be Local (L). Wait, but sometimes if it's a kernel vulnerability, maybe it's considered Network? Hmm, no. The sysctl is a local interface, so the attack vector is Local. So AV:L.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires that the attacker can read and modify the sysctl variables concurrently. The fix involves adding READ_ONCE() to prevent data races. The complexity here is that the attacker needs to have concurrent access, which might be considered high complexity because it requires specific timing or conditions. But I'm not sure. If the exploit requires the attacker to have a specific sequence of actions, maybe it's High. But sometimes data races can be exploited with low complexity. Wait, the original issue is that the variables can be changed concurrently. So the attacker needs to have access to the system and be able to read and write at the same time. That might be considered High complexity because it's not a simple exploit. So AC:H.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have local access, which typically requires some level of privilege. But the sysctl variables are usually accessible to users with certain permissions. However, the vulnerability is about data races, which might not require elevated privileges. Wait, the sysctl variables are part of the kernel, so to exploit this, the attacker would need to be able to access the sysctl interface, which might require root or administrative privileges. But the description doesn't specify if it's a privilege escalation. The problem is that the variables can be changed concurrently, so maybe the attacker doesn't need to have any specific privileges beyond what's needed to access the sysctl. But since it's a kernel vulnerability, maybe PR is None (N) because the attacker can exploit it without needing additional privileges. Wait, but if the sysctl is accessible to users, then maybe the attacker doesn't need to have high privileges. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The sysctl interface is typically accessible to users with root privileges. So if the attacker is local, they might already have the necessary privileges. But the vulnerability is about data races, which could allow for arbitrary code execution or other issues. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be a local user with some privileges, then PR would be Low (L). But if the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, then PR is None. Since the sysctl variables are part of the kernel, and the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attacker would need to be local, but maybe they don't need to have elevated privileges. Wait, but the sysctl is a user-space interface. So maybe the attacker is a local user with normal privileges. But the data race could allow for privilege escalation. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability, not the potential for escalation. So if the attacker can exploit it without needing any additional privileges beyond what's already required to access the sysctl, then PR is None. But I'm not sure. Maybe the PR is Low because the attacker needs to have local access, which is a low privilege requirement. Wait, the PR options are None, Low, High. None means no privileges are required. Low means the attacker needs to have some privileges, like user-level access. High would be root or similar. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attacker would need to be local, which is a low privilege requirement. So PR:L. Or maybe PR:N if the attacker can exploit it without needing any specific privileges. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let me check some examples. For example, a vulnerability that allows local code execution would have PR:L. But if the attacker is already local, maybe PR is None. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already local, then they might not need any additional privileges. So PR:N. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is PR:N because the attacker is local, and the vulnerability is in the kernel, so they can exploit it without needing to escalate privileges. So PR:N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is a data race, which can be exploited without any user interaction. The attacker can trigger the exploit by accessing the sysctl variables concurrently. So UI:N.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the data race could lead to issues in the kernel, but the scope is unchanged if the attack doesn't affect other components. Wait, the scope is Changed (C) if the attack can affect a different component. For example, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain higher privileges, then the scope is Changed. But in this case, the data race might not change the scope. The original description says that the variables can be changed concurrently, leading to data races. If the data race leads to a privilege escalation, then the scope would be Changed. But the description doesn't mention that. It just says that the variables can be changed concurrently. So the scope is Unchanged (U), because the attack doesn't affect a different component. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The data race could lead to information disclosure. If the variables are being read and written concurrently, the attacker might read incorrect data, leading to confidentiality issues. So C:High (H) if the data is sensitive. But the sysctl variables might contain sensitive information. So C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I). If the data race allows the attacker to modify the variables, leading to integrity issues. So I:H.\n\nAvailability (A). If the data race causes a denial of service, then A:H. But the description doesn't mention that. It just says that the variables can be changed concurrently. So maybe the availability is not affected. But data races can lead to crashes or other issues. However, the description doesn't specify that. So maybe A:N. But I'm not sure. If the data race could lead to a crash, then A:H. But the original fix is to prevent data races, which might prevent crashes. So maybe the availability is not affected. So A:N.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for the base metrics. Let me check again. The CVSS v3.1 base metrics. For the given CVE, the vulnerability is a data race in the sysctl variables. The data race could allow an attacker to read or modify the variables in a way that leads to different outcomes. So for confidentiality, if the variables are sensitive, then C:H. For integrity, if the attacker can modify the variables, then I:H. For availability, if the data race leads to a crash or denial of service, then A:H. But the description doesn't mention that. So maybe the answer is that the vulnerability could allow for confidentiality and integrity issues, but not availability. So C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:L (Local), AC:H (High complexity), PR:N (None), UI:N (None), S:U (Unchanged), C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nWait, but earlier I was confused about PR. Let me recheck. The PR is the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is local, then they might not need any additional privileges. So PR:N. Because the attacker is already local, and the vulnerability is in the kernel, so they can exploit it without needing to escalate privileges. So PR:N.\n\nSo the vector would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nBut wait, the user's example had \"Answer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\" which is a different scenario. But in this case, the answer would be as above. However, I need to make sure each metric is correctly chosen.\n\nAnother thought: Attack Complexity. If the data race can be exploited with low complexity, like just having concurrent access, then AC:L. But the original problem is that the variables can be changed concurrently. So the attacker needs to have access to read and write at the same time, which might be considered high complexity. But I'm not sure. Maybe the complexity is Low because the attacker can exploit it without needing to perform complex steps. For example, if the attacker can trigger the race by reading and writing at the same time, which might be considered low complexity. So AC:L. That would change the AC to L. Then the vector would be AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nBut I'm not certain. Let me think again. Attack Complexity is Low if the attack can be performed with no additional user interaction and the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without requiring special conditions. If the data race is a race condition that can be triggered by the attacker with simple actions, then AC:L. So maybe AC:L. So the answer would have AC:L.\n\nSo the final vector would be:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nBut I need to confirm each metric again.\n\nAttack Vector: Local (L) because the vulnerability is in", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 3.0, "success": true}

A SQL Injection vulnerability was identified in versions prior to 3.4.6 in the endpoint `/html/atendido/Profile_Atendido.php`, in the `idatendido` parameter. This vulnerability allow an authorized attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing access to sensitive information. Version 3.4.6 fixes the issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 scoring. The user provided a CVE description about a SQL injection vulnerability in WeGIA. I need to figure out each of the base metrics and then construct the vector string.\n\nFirst, the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in a web endpoint, so the attacker would need to access the web application. Since it's a web-based attack, the AV is Network (N). Because the attacker can exploit it over the network without needing physical access or local access.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). SQL injection typically requires the attacker to craft specific input, which might be considered low complexity. But sometimes, if there's a lot of steps, it could be high. However, since the vulnerability is in a parameter, it's likely low complexity. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The description says an authorized attacker can exploit it. So the attacker already has some level of access, like being authenticated. That would be Low (L) because they don't need to escalate privileges, just have access to the system.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability allows executing arbitrary SQL queries. If the attacker can do this without needing user interaction, then UI is None (N). But wait, the description says \"authorized attacker\", so maybe the user has to be logged in. But the UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. Since the attacker can exploit it without the user doing anything else, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability allows access to sensitive information. Since the attack affects the same scope (the application's data), the scope is Unchanged (U). If the attack could affect a different scope, like allowing remote code execution, then it would be Changed (C), but here it's just SQL injection, so same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows access to sensitive information, so that's High (H) because it's about data confidentiality.\n\nIntegrity (I). The description mentions that the attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, which could modify data. So Integrity is High (H) because the attacker can alter data.\n\nAvailability (A). The vulnerability doesn't mention anything about denial of service, so Availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Let me double-check each metric again to make sure. Yes, that seems right. The user interaction is none because the attacker can exploit it without needing the user to do anything. The scope is unchanged because the attack doesn't change the scope. The privileges required are low because the attacker is already authorized. Alright, that should be correct.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.7000000000000011, "success": true}
