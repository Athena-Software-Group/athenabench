This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the IndieBlocks plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, allowing authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts. These scripts execute when a user accesses the injected page.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means the payload is stored on the server and executed when a user accesses the page. Since it's stored, the attack doesn't require network access from the attacker's side. However, the user needs to access the page where the script is stored. But in terms of AV, the attack vector is typically considered as Network (N) because the initial injection might be done via a web request, even if it's stored. Wait, but stored XSS is usually considered as requiring the user to visit the page, which is a local action. Hmm, but the initial injection is done via a network request. So maybe AV is Network (N) because the attacker sends the malicious script through the network to the server, which then stores it. So AV is N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization. If the attacker can inject the script by sending a request with the 'kind' parameter, that's a low complexity. The attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps; just sending a crafted request with the parameter. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The description says authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above. Contributor is a role in WordPress that allows editing posts but not publishing. So the attacker needs to be authenticated with at least that level. Therefore, PR is Low (L) because the required privileges are not high, but not None. Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). Since the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. But in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges needed. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered as requiring some privileges. However, in the case of stored XSS, if the attacker is already authenticated, maybe the PR is Low. But I need to check the definitions. According to CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. But the options are N, L, H. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, but the system allows that, then PR is Low. Because High would be if the attacker needs administrative privileges. So here, Contributor is a lower-level privilege, so PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is stored, so the user doesn't need to interact with the attacker's input. The script is executed when the user accesses the page. However, the user interaction is required for the attack to occur. Wait, in stored XSS, the user has to view the page where the script is stored. So the user interaction is required. But the UI metric in CVSS is about whether user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. For example, if the attack requires the user to click on a link, that's required. In stored XSS, the user just needs to view the page, which is a form of interaction. However, in CVSS, UI is considered as 'Required' if the user must take some action, like clicking a link. But in stored XSS, the user doesn't have to do anything; the script executes automatically when they access the page. Wait, but the user has to access the page. So maybe UI is 'None' because the user doesn't need to interact beyond accessing the page. Wait, the definition of UI in CVSS is: \"Whether user interaction is required for the attack to be successful.\" If the user must perform an action (like clicking a link), then UI is Required. If the attack is triggered automatically when the user visits the page, then UI is None. But in stored XSS, the user just needs to view the page, which is a passive action. However, the CVSS UI metric is about whether the user must interact with the attack vector. For example, if the attack is via a phishing link that the user clicks, that's Required. If the attack is via a stored script that executes when the user visits the page, then UI is None. So in this case, since the user doesn't need to interact beyond accessing the page, UI is None (N). Wait, but the user has to access the page, which is a form of interaction. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the CVSS documentation. According to NIST, UI is 'None' if the attack can be initiated without any user interaction, such as through a network-based exploit. If the attack requires the user to take an action (e.g., open an email, click a link), then UI is 'Required'. In stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact with the attacker's input; the script is executed when the user accesses the page. So the user's action is just visiting the page, which is a normal action. Therefore, UI is 'None' because the attack doesn't require the user to perform an action beyond their normal use. Wait, but the user has to access the page where the script is stored. However, in the context of CVSS, UI is about whether the user must interact with the attack vector. Since the user is just visiting a page they normally would, it's considered as not requiring user interaction. Therefore, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component where the attack is initiated. Since the plugin is part of WordPress, and the attack is within the same application, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component (like a different system), then it would be Changed. Here, the attack is within the same application, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary scripts. This can allow the attacker to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, etc. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can access sensitive information. Integrity is High (H) because the attacker can modify data or perform actions. Availability is High (H) if the attack can cause denial of service, but in this case, the XSS is more about data manipulation and confidentiality. However, the description doesn't mention availability impact. So for C, I, and A, we need to assess based on the vulnerability type. Stored XSS typically impacts confidentiality and integrity. Availability is not directly affected unless the script causes the page to crash, which isn't mentioned here. So C is H, I is H, A is N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but earlier I thought UI might be N. Let me double-check. If the user has to access the page, but that's part of normal usage, then UI is None. So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

The CVE is about a Stored XSS vulnerability in a WordPress plugin. First, I need to recall the CVSS v3.1 metrics and how they apply here.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). Since it's a web application vulnerability that can be exploited over the network, AV is Network (N). The attacker doesn't need physical access or adjacent network, so N makes sense.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next.

The user wants me to determine each metric's value and then create the vector string.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the CVSS v3.1 metrics. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in a web application, and the attack is via a parameter in a URL. Since it's a reflected XSS, the attacker would typically send a malicious link over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Reflected XSS usually requires the user to click on a malicious link. The attacker doesn't need to do anything complex beyond crafting the payload. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): For XSS, the attacker doesn't need any special privileges. The user just needs to visit the link. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The user has to interact by clicking the link, so UI is Required (R). Wait, but some might argue that if the attack is via a phishing email, the user interaction is required. However, in the case of reflected XSS, the user must interact with the malicious input. So UI is R.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the same component (the web application) that's being attacked. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affected a different component, it would be Changed, but here it's the same application.\n\nConfidentiality (C): XSS can steal session cookies, leading to unauthorized access. So the impact on confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): XSS can allow an attacker to modify data or inject malicious content. So Integrity impact is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): XSS typically doesn't affect availability directly. Unless the script causes a DoS, but the description doesn't mention that. So Availability is None (N).\n\nWait, but the problem says to determine each metric. Let me check again. The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, which is a client-side issue. The attacker injects a script that runs in the user's browser. So the impact on confidentiality and integrity is high because the attacker can steal data or manipulate the UI. Availability isn't impacted here. So C, I are H, A is N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N\nAC: L\nPR: N\nUI: R\nS: U\nC: H\nI: H\nA: N\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm the User Interaction. Some sources say that for XSS, UI is Required because the user has to click the link. However, in some cases, if the attack is via a malicious website that the user visits, it's still required. So UI:R is correct here.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

This is to prevent a possible integer underflow that might happen when copying the source scatterlist into a linear buffer.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's crypto module, specifically the qat component. The issue is that they added a parameter check for RSA to reject requests where the source buffer is larger than the key size. This is to prevent an integer underflow when copying the source scatterlist into a linear buffer.\n\nSo, the vulnerability is about an integer underflow that could lead to some kind of memory corruption or unexpected behavior. Let's break down each metric step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. If the vulnerability can be exploited remotely without needing physical access, then AV would be Network (N). But if it requires local access, like a user with local privileges, then it's Local (L). However, since the kernel is a core part of the system, and the vulnerability is in the crypto module, which might be used by applications, but the exploit would need to be triggered by a local user or through some system call. Wait, but the description doesn't mention if it's exploitable remotely. The fix is about preventing an integer underflow when copying data. If the underflow could be triggered by a local user, then AV is Local. But if the vulnerability is in a component that's accessible over the network, maybe AV is Network. However, the description doesn't specify that. Since it's a kernel vulnerability, it's possible that an attacker would need local access to exploit it, unless there's a way to trigger it remotely. But without more info, I think AV is Local (L) because kernel vulnerabilities often require local access unless there's a specific network service involved. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should check if the vulnerability is in a part that's exposed over the network. The qat module is part of the Intel QuickAssist Technology, which is a hardware acceleration for crypto. If that's used in a network service, maybe. But the description doesn't mention that. Hmm. Maybe I should default to Local (L) unless there's a clear indication of network access. So AV is Local (L).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is an integer underflow. Exploiting that might require precise control over the data to trigger the underflow, which could be considered Low (L) if it's straightforward, or High (H) if it's complex. Since integer underflows can be exploited with specific crafted inputs, maybe AC is Low. But I need to think about how easy it is to exploit. If the attacker can create a buffer that's larger than the key size, which is a parameter they can control, then it's a simple condition. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). To exploit this, does the attacker need any privileges? If the vulnerability is in the kernel, an attacker would need to have some way to trigger the vulnerable code. If the code is part of a system call that's accessible to unprivileged users, then PR is None (N). But if the code is only accessible to privileged users, then PR is High (H). However, the vulnerability is in the kernel's crypto module, which is used by various processes. If a local user can trigger the RSA operation with a malicious buffer, then they might not need elevated privileges. So PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any special privileges beyond normal user access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). Does the exploit require the user to interact, like clicking a link or opening a file? If the vulnerability is in a system call that can be triggered by a local process, then UI is None (N). If the exploit requires the user to perform an action, like opening a malicious file, then UI is Required (R). The description doesn't mention user interaction, so I think UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel) that's being attacked. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, then it would be Changed (C). But here, the vulnerability is within the same component, so S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A). The vulnerability is an integer underflow that could lead to memory corruption. Memory corruption can lead to various issues. If the underflow allows an attacker to overwrite memory, they could potentially read or write arbitrary data, leading to confidentiality or integrity issues. Availability could be affected if the system crashes. However, the description says the fix is to prevent the underflow, which might prevent a denial of service. But the original vulnerability's impact isn't specified. However, in CVSS, if the vulnerability could lead to a complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability, then the metric is High (H). If it's partial, then Low (L). Since the vulnerability is a buffer overflow that could be exploited to gain control, it's likely that all three metrics are High (H). But I need to be careful. If the underflow leads to a crash, then Availability is High. If it allows data leakage, then Confidentiality is High. If it allows data modification, then Integrity is High. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, which is critical, the impact is likely high across all three. So C, I, A are all High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) – because the vulnerability is in the kernel, which requires local access to exploit.\nAC: Low (L) – the exploit is straightforward with crafted input.\nPR: None (N) – no special privileges needed.\nUI: None (N) – no user interaction required.\nS: Unchanged (U) – same component affected.\nC: High (H) – potential for data leakage.\nI: High (H) – potential for data modification.\nA: High (H) – potential for denial of service.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 2.9000000000000004, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Betheme WordPress plugin. The issue arises from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject scripts, which then execute when users access the affected pages.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is stored, meaning the malicious script is stored on the server and executed when a user accesses the page. Since it's stored, the attack vector is likely through the network because the attacker doesn't need physical access or adjacent network access. So AV is Network (N).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions that the attacker needs to inject the script, but since it's stored XSS, the complexity might be low. The attacker just needs to find a way to inject the script, which might be straightforward if the input isn't properly sanitized. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access. Contributor access in WordPress allows users to create and edit posts but not publish them. However, the vulnerability allows them to inject scripts. Since the attacker needs some level of access, but not administrative, PR is Low (L). Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege, so PR is Low. But if the attacker doesn't need any privileges, it's N. However, the description says \"authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above,\" so they do need some privileges. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). Stored XSS doesn't require user interaction. The script is stored and executed when the user accesses the page. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component where the attack is initiated. Since the plugin is part of the WordPress site, and the attack is within the same application context, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affected a different component, it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). For XSS, the main impact is on integrity and confidentiality. The attacker can inject scripts that steal session cookies (confidentiality) or alter the page content (integrity). Availability might not be directly impacted unless the script causes a denial of service, which isn't mentioned here. So C is High (H), I is High (H), and A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the PR was Low because the attacker needs contributor access. Let me check again. The options for PR are None, Low, High. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. But contributor-level access is a low privilege, so PR is Low (L). So the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.

Prior to version 25.4.0, the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently, conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization, which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result, the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions, conda-build creates a potential execution pathway for malicious code, violating security assumptions. This issue has been patched in version 25.4.0.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in conda-build, where using the eval function on user-provided meta.yaml files allows arbitrary code execution. The problem is that the eval isn't properly sanitized, leading to code execution during the build process. The impact is on the integrity of the build environment, allowing unauthorized commands or file operations.\n\nNow, I need to assign each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is due to processing user input in meta.yaml files. Since these files are part of the build process, an attacker would need to provide a malicious meta.yaml. If the build process is done over a network, maybe someone could push a malicious package. But the description doesn't specify if the attack requires network access. However, since conda packages are typically distributed over the internet, and the build process might be triggered by downloading a package, I think AV is Network (N). Unless the attack requires local access to the system, but the vulnerability is in the processing of the meta.yaml, which is part of the build process. So AV is N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to using eval on untrusted input. The attacker just needs to craft a meta.yaml with malicious code. Since there's no need for complex steps, like exploiting a specific flaw or multiple steps, AC is Low (L). The attack is straightforward once the input is manipulated.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any special privileges. The vulnerability is in the build process, which is typically run by the user who is building the package. If the user is malicious, they can create a meta.yaml that executes code. So PR is None (N), because no privileges are needed beyond what the user already has.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack requires the user to process the malicious meta.yaml. For example, the user might run 'conda build' on a package that has the malicious meta.yaml. So the user has to interact by executing the build command. Therefore, UI is Required (R). Wait, but if the user is tricked into using a malicious package, maybe it's required. However, if the attacker can get the user to run the build command on their package, then UI is required. So yes, UI is R.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component that's being attacked. The conda-build tool is processing the meta.yaml, which is part of the same system. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to another component, it would be Changed, but here it's within the same context.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution, which could lead to unauthorized access to data. If the code can read files, then confidentiality is impacted. The description mentions unauthorized commands or file operations, which could include reading files. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The integrity is definitely compromised because the attacker can execute arbitrary code, which can modify files or perform actions that alter the system's state. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The code execution could potentially cause the system to crash or become unavailable. However, the description doesn't explicitly mention availability issues. But since arbitrary code execution can lead to denial of service, maybe A is High. However, if the attack is more about integrity, maybe A is Low or None. Wait, the description says \"unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed.\" If those commands could be to delete files or crash the system, then availability is impacted. But the primary impact here is integrity. However, the CVSS guidelines say that if the attack can cause a denial of service, then A is High. But the description doesn't specify that. Hmm. The original vulnerability is about code execution, which can lead to various impacts. Since the problem is that the code can be executed, which could lead to any of the three impacts. But the description says \"the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed.\" So the main impact is integrity. However, the availability might be considered as High if the code can cause the system to crash. But without explicit mention, maybe A is Low or None. Wait, the CVSS v3.1 guidelines for Availability: High if the vulnerability can cause the system to become unavailable. If the code execution could be used to delete critical files or crash the system, then A is High. But the description doesn't specify that. However, the presence of arbitrary code execution often implies that availability could be affected. But since the description doesn't mention it, maybe A is Low or None. Alternatively, if the code execution is limited to the build process, maybe it's not affecting the overall system's availability. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the CVSS guidelines again. The Availability metric is High if the vulnerability can cause the system to become unavailable. If the code execution is within the build process, maybe it's not affecting the system's availability beyond that. But if the code can cause the build process to fail, which might be considered a denial of service for the build, but not the entire system. However, the CVSS might consider that as a High impact. Alternatively, if the code execution is limited to the build environment, maybe A is Low. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The original problem is that the code can be executed during the build process. If the attacker can execute code that deletes the build directory, that would affect availability of the build process. But the system as a whole might not be affected. However, the CVSS might consider that as a High impact. Alternatively, maybe the availability is not impacted, so A is None. But I need to make a decision here. Since the description doesn't mention availability, but the code execution could lead to that, maybe A is Low. But I'm not certain. Let me check the example. In the example given, the answer has A:H. Wait, the example in the user's message shows a vector with C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. Let me think again. The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution, which can lead to any of the three impacts. The description says \"the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed.\" So the main impact is integrity. However, the code execution could also lead to confidentiality (reading files) or availability (crashing the system). But the description doesn't specify. In the absence of explicit information, the CVSS guidelines suggest that if the vulnerability can be used to cause a denial of service, then A is High. But if it's not specified, maybe A is Low or None. However, in practice, arbitrary code execution is often considered to have High impact on all three. But I need to be precise. The CVSS v3.1 base score calculation for Availability: High if the vulnerability can cause the system to become unavailable. If the code execution can be used to cause the system to crash, then A is High. But if the code execution is limited to the build process, maybe not. However, the build process is part of the system's operation. If the code execution can cause the build to fail, which is a denial of service for the build, but not the entire system. This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to assume that since the code can be executed, and that could lead to any of the impacts, but the description doesn't mention availability, so A is Low. Alternatively, if the code execution is a remote code execution, then availability might be considered. But I'm not sure. Let me check the CVSS documentation. According to the CVSS v3.1 documentation, the Availability metric is High if the vulnerability can cause the system to become unavailable. If the code execution can be used to cause the system to crash or become unavailable, then A is High. If the code execution is limited to the build process, maybe it's not affecting the system's availability. However, the build process is part of the system's operation. If the code execution can cause the build to fail, which is a denial of service for the build, but not the entire system. This is a bit ambiguous. Given that the description doesn't mention availability, but the code execution is a serious vulnerability, I think the best approach is to assign A as High, as arbitrary code execution can lead to various impacts, including availability. So I'll go with A:H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: H (High)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 1.0, "success": true}

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Pollin plugin for WordPress, allowing SQL injection through the 'question' parameter. It's due to insufficient escaping and lack of prepared statements. The attacker is unauthenticated and can extract sensitive info.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description says it's possible for unauthenticated attackers to exploit this. Since the attack can be done remotely without needing physical access or adjacent network, AV should be Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. SQL injection typically requires crafting a specific payload, but if it's straightforward, like appending a query, maybe it's Low (L). The description mentions \"insufficient escaping\" which might make it easier, so AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the attacker is unauthenticated. They don't need any user privileges to exploit this.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is None (N) since the attack doesn't require any user interaction. The attacker can send a crafted request directly.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability is in the plugin, which is part of the WordPress application. The attack doesn't affect a different component or change the scope beyond the existing application.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is High (H) because the attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, which directly impacts confidentiality.\n\nIntegrity (I) is High (H) as well. If the attacker can inject SQL, they might modify data, leading to integrity issues.\n\nAvailability (A) is High (H) if the attack can cause the database to crash or become unavailable. However, the description mentions extracting data, not necessarily disrupting availability. Wait, the original description says \"extract sensitive information,\" which is more about confidentiality. But maybe the SQL injection could also lead to denial of service. Hmm, but the CVE description doesn't mention availability impact. So maybe A is None (N) unless there's a reason to assume it. But the problem says to determine based on the given info. Since the description only mentions extracting data, maybe A is None. Wait, but the CVSS v3.1 metrics for Availability: if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a denial of service, then A is High. If not, then it's None. The CVE description doesn't mention availability, so I think A is None. Wait, but the original question says to determine based on the given description. The description says \"extract sensitive information,\" which is confidentiality. So maybe Availability is None. But I need to check if the SQL injection could also affect availability. However, without explicit mention, it's safer to assume only confidentiality and integrity are affected. So A is None (N). Wait, but the original problem might have different expectations. Let me check again. The vulnerability allows extracting data, which is confidentiality. Integrity could be affected if the attacker can modify data. But the description doesn't mention modifying data, just extracting. So maybe I is Low or None? Wait, the CVSS metrics for Integrity: High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data. If the SQL injection can be used to alter data, then I is High. But the description says \"extract sensitive information,\" which is more about confidentiality. However, SQL injection can sometimes be used for both. But the problem states that the vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping, which might allow appending queries. If the attacker can inject a query to read data, that's confidentiality. If they can inject to modify, that's integrity. The description doesn't specify, but the general case for SQL injection is that it can lead to both. However, the CVSS calculation might require us to consider the maximum impact. Since the attacker can extract data, which is a high impact on confidentiality, and if they can also modify, that's high on integrity. But the problem says \"extract sensitive information,\" so maybe I is Low or None. Wait, the CVSS v3.1 metrics for Integrity: High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data. If the vulnerability allows for data modification, then I is High. If not, then it's Low or None. The description doesn't mention modification, only extraction. So maybe I is Low? Or is it considered that SQL injection can be used for both, so I is High? This is a bit ambiguous. But the original CVE description says \"extract sensitive information,\" which is confidentiality. So maybe I is None? Wait, but the CVSS metrics for Integrity: if the vulnerability allows the attacker to alter data, then I is High. If not, then it's None. Since the description doesn't mention altering data, but just extracting, maybe I is None. However, in practice, SQL injection can be used for both. But the problem says to base it on the given description. So I think I should go with C: High, I: None, A: None. Wait, but the original problem might have different expectations. Let me check again. The vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping, which allows appending queries. If the attacker can inject a query to read data, that's confidentiality. If they can inject to modify, that's integrity. The description doesn't specify, but the general case for SQL injection is that it can be used for both. However, the problem states that the attacker can \"extract sensitive information,\" which is confidentiality. So maybe I is Low or None. But the CVSS metrics for Integrity: High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data. Since the description doesn't mention modification, maybe I is None. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the default is to assume that if the vulnerability allows for data extraction, it's possible that the attacker could also modify data, so I is High. But without explicit mention, it's safer to assume only confidentiality. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. According to CVSS, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data, then I is High. If not, then it's None. Since the description doesn't mention modification, but just extraction, I think I should set I to None. However, in practice, SQL injection can be used for both, but the problem's description doesn't mention it. So I'll go with I: None. Wait, but the original problem might have a different approach. Let me think again. The vulnerability is SQL injection, which is a common vector for both confidentiality and integrity. However, the specific impact here is extraction of data. So maybe the impact on integrity is not present. Therefore, I: None. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the CVSS calculation for SQL injection typically includes High for both C and I. But the problem says to base it on the given description. The given description says \"extract sensitive information,\" which is confidentiality. So C: High, I: None, A: None. But I'm not sure. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 guidelines again. The Integrity metric is High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data, that's confidentiality. So in this case, since the attacker can read data, C is High, and I is None. Availability is None unless the attack can cause a denial of service. The description doesn't mention that, so A is None. So the metrics would be:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but that would make the CVSS vector with C:H, I:N, A:N. But I'm not sure about the Integrity. Maybe the problem expects I to be High because SQL injection can be used to modify data. But the description doesn't mention that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that since the attacker can inject SQL, they can modify data, so I is High. But the description only mentions extraction. This is a bit of a judgment call. However, the CVSS guidelines state that if the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data, then I is High. If not, then it's None. Since the description doesn't mention modification, I think I should go with I: None. Therefore, the final metrics would be as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 2.5999999999999996, "success": true}

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Pure Chat plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject scripts that execute when a user accesses the affected page.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is a stored XSS, the attack can be delivered through a web request. The attacker doesn't need physical access or adjacent network; it's over the network. So AV should be Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. Stored XSS typically requires the attacker to inject the payload into the application, which might be straightforward. Since the vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization, the attack might not require complex steps. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is about the level of access needed. The description says unauthenticated attackers can exploit this. That means no privileges are required. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) refers to whether the user needs to interact for the attack to succeed. In stored XSS, the user doesn't need to do anything; just accessing the page triggers the script.

Then we pass the result to uverbs_request_next_ptr() which also could potentially wrap. The \"cmd.sge_count * sizeof(struct ib_uverbs_sge)\" multiplication can also overflow on 32bit systems although it's fine on 64bit systems. This patch does two things. First, I've re-arranged the condition in uverbs_request_next_ptr() so that the use controlled variable \"len\" is on one side of the comparison by itself without any math. Then I've modified all the callers to use size_mul() for the multiplications.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to an integer overflow in the RDMA/uverbs code. The problem arises when multiplying user-provided u32 values, which can lead to integer wrapping. This could potentially be exploited by an attacker to cause a buffer overflow or other issues.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since the issue is related to user-provided data that's processed by the kernel, the attack would typically require network access if the RDMA is used over a network. However, RDMA can be used in different contexts. But given that the kernel is involved, and the input comes from user space, maybe the attack vector is Network (N) if the user is accessing via a network interface. Alternatively, if it's a local exploit, maybe Local (L). But the description doesn't specify whether the user is local or remote. However, since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the input is from the user, it's possible that an attacker could exploit this via a local user or a remote user. But without more context, I think the default for kernel vulnerabilities is often Network (N) if it's exploitable over the network. Wait, but RDMA is typically used in high-performance computing environments, which might be local. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. However, the CVSS guidelines state that if the attack can be initiated remotely without prior authentication, AV is Network. If it's a local exploit, then AV is Local. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the input is from the user, but the user could be local or remote. However, the description doesn't mention network access, so maybe it's a local vulnerability. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the user-provided data is processed by the kernel. If the user is a local user, then AV is Local. If the user is a remote user (e.g., via a network service), then AV is Network. Since the description doesn't specify, but the kernel is part of the system, maybe the attack vector is Local (L). But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the attack vector is Network (N) if the RDMA is used over a network. However, without explicit mention, I might have to default to Local. But I need to check the CVSS guidelines. The CVSS documentation says that if the vulnerability can be exploited over the network, AV is Network. If it's a local exploit, then AV is Local. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the input is from the user, but the user could be local or remote. However, the description doesn't specify, so maybe the safest assumption is that it's a local vulnerability. But I'm not sure. Let me check other metrics to see if that helps.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow. Exploiting this would require the attacker to craft specific input that causes the overflow. Since the multiplication of two u32 values can overflow, the attacker would need to provide specific values that trigger the overflow. This might be considered Low (L) because the attack is straightforward once the vulnerability is known. However, if the attacker needs to have precise control over the input values, maybe it's High (H). But integer overflows are often considered Low complexity because they can be exploited with specific input. So I think AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so an attacker would need to have some level of access. If the user is a local user, then PR might be None (N) if the user can exploit it without additional privileges. However, if the kernel is protected and the user needs elevated privileges, then PR would be High (H). But the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the input comes from the user. If the user is a normal user, they might not have the necessary privileges to trigger the vulnerability. Wait, but the kernel is running with high privileges. If the user can send data to the kernel via RDMA, maybe they need to have some privileges. However, the description doesn't mention that. If the vulnerability can be exploited by a local user without additional privileges, then PR is None (N). But if the user needs to have root or some elevated privileges, then PR is High (H). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the input is from the user, I think the attacker would need to have some level of access to the system. However, if the user is a normal user, they might be able to exploit this. But I'm not sure. Maybe the PR is None (N) because the user can exploit it without needing additional privileges. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the user needs to have access to the RDMA interface, which might require certain privileges, then PR could be Low (L). This is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the input is from the user. If the user is a normal user, they can send data to the kernel via the RDMA interface. If that's possible without elevated privileges, then PR is None (N). Otherwise, if they need to have root access, then PR is High (H). Since the description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is in the kernel, I think PR is None (N) because the user can exploit it without needing additional privileges beyond what's already available. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is PR: None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is due to user-provided data. If the user needs to interact with the system (e.g., run a specific application that sends the malicious data), then UI is Required (R). However, if the vulnerability can be exploited automatically without user interaction, then UI is None (N). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the input is from the user, the attacker would need to send the malicious data, which might require user interaction. For example, if the user runs an application that uses RDMA and sends the crafted data, then UI is Required. However, if the attacker can exploit it through a network service without user interaction, then UI is None. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think UI is None (N) if the attack can be done without user interaction. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the user has to run an application that triggers the vulnerability, then UI is Required. This is another ambiguous point. Maybe the answer is UI: None (N) because the vulnerability is in the kernel and the input is from the user, but the user might not need to interact beyond sending the data. However, I'm not certain. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. The UI metric is about whether user interaction is required. If the attack requires the user to perform an action (like clicking a link), then UI is Required. If it's an automatic exploit, then UI is None. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the input is from the user, the user would need to send the data, which might be considered as requiring user interaction. But if the user is an attacker who can send the data through a service, maybe it's not required. This is tricky. I'll go with UI: None (N) for now, but I'm not sure.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component as the affected system. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects a different component, then it would be Changed (C). Since the kernel is part of the same system, S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability is an integer overflow that could lead to buffer overflow or other issues. If exploited, it could allow an attacker to read or write arbitrary memory, leading to information disclosure, data modification, or denial of service. So all three (C, I, A) would be High (H). However, the description doesn't explicitly mention the impact. But integer overflows can lead to various issues. If the overflow leads to a buffer overflow, the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code, which would affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Therefore, C, I, A are all High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Network (N) or Local (L)? Earlier I was uncertain. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the input is from the user. If the user is a local user, then AV is Local. If the user is remote, then AV is Network. Since the description doesn't specify, but the kernel is part of the system, and the input is from the user, I think AV is Local (L). However, if the RDMA is used over a network, then the attack could be remote. But without explicit mention, I'm not sure. However, in many cases, kernel vulnerabilities that are exploitable via user input are considered Local (L) unless they can be triggered remotely. So I'll go with AV: Local (L).\n\nPR: None (N) because the user can exploit it without needing additional privileges.\n\nUI: None (N) because the attack doesn't require user interaction beyond sending the data.\n\nSo the metrics would be:\n\nAV: L\nAC: L\nPR: N\nUI: N\nS: U\nC: H\nI: H\nA: H\n\nBut wait, if AV is Local, then the vector is AV:L. However, if the attack can be done remotely, then AV:N. But the description doesn't specify.

Ensure platform_set_drvdata() is called before devm_pm_runtime_enable().\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the phy driver for rockchip and samsung-hdptx. The issue is that drvdata is set before enabling runtime PM, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the probe function doesn't set the drvdata first.\n\nSo, the problem here is a NULL pointer dereference. Let me recall the CVSS metrics. The base score is determined by AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let's go through each one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel-level issue, an attacker would need to have access to the system. But wait, the vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. How is this exploited? If the code is called during the probe phase, maybe an attacker could trigger this by causing the probe to run in a certain way. But I'm not sure. However, since it's a kernel vulnerability, the attack vector is likely Network (N) if it can be exploited remotely, but maybe Local (L) if it requires local access. Wait, but the description doesn't mention remote exploitation. It's a race condition or a flaw in the driver's initialization. So maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker would need to have some way to trigger the probe function, which might be part of a local exploit. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the driver is used in a way that allows remote access, maybe Network. But the description doesn't specify. Hmm. I think in the absence of specific info, for kernel vulnerabilities, sometimes AV is Network if it's a remote exploit, but here it's a local issue. Let me think again. The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which could lead to a crash, but to exploit it, the attacker would need to have the ability to trigger the probe function. That might require local access. So AV is Local (L). But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should check if there's any indication of remote exploit. The description doesn't mention that. So I'll go with AV: Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. To exploit this, the attacker would need to trigger the specific code path where the drvdata isn't set yet. That might require some specific conditions, but if it's a simple race condition or a predictable scenario, then AC is Low (L). If it's complex, then High (H). Since the problem is that the drvdata is not set before enabling runtime PM, maybe the attacker can exploit this by causing the runtime resume to be called before the drvdata is set. That might be a straightforward scenario, so AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): To exploit this, the attacker would need to have some level of access. If it's a local exploit, maybe the attacker needs to have root privileges or some way to trigger the probe function. But if the vulnerability is in a driver that's used by the kernel, maybe the attacker needs to have local access. However, if the driver is part of a system that's accessible via a user-space application, maybe the attacker can exploit it without high privileges. But in this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have the ability to execute code in the kernel, which typically requires root privileges. So PR is High (H). Wait, but if the vulnerability is a use-after-free or a NULL dereference that can be triggered via a user-space application, then maybe PR is Low or None. However, the description doesn't mention that. It's a kernel driver, so the attacker would need to have kernel-level access. Therefore, PR is High (H). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the vulnerability can be triggered by a local user without needing elevated privileges, then PR could be Low. But I think in kernel vulnerabilities, PR is often High unless it's a user-space issue. So I'll go with PR: High (H).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so does it require user interaction? If the exploit requires the user to perform some action, like running a specific application, then UI is Required (R). But if it's a flaw that can be triggered automatically, then UI is None (N). The description doesn't mention user interaction, so I think UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component as the affected system. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects a different component, like a separate service, then it would be Changed (C). But here, it's within the kernel, so S: Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which can lead to a crash. If the system crashes, that affects availability. However, if the attacker can exploit this to gain access, it might affect confidentiality or integrity. But the description doesn't mention data leakage or modification. The main impact is a crash, which would be availability. So C: None (N), I: None (N), A: High (H) because the system could be made unavailable. Wait, but a NULL dereference might not always lead to a denial of service. It depends on the context. If the system crashes, then availability is impacted. So A: High (H). But maybe the impact is low. Hmm. Alternatively, if the vulnerability is a crash that can be triggered, but the attacker can't control the outcome, maybe the impact is low. But in CVSS, if the vulnerability can lead to a system crash, that's considered high availability impact. So I think A: High (H). For confidentiality and integrity, since the vulnerability is a NULL dereference, it's unlikely to leak data or modify data, so C: None, I: None.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: High (H)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about AV. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, but the attack vector is local, then AV is Local. However, sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger the code. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think AV is Local (L). But maybe I should check if there's any indication of remote exploit. The CVE description doesn't mention that, so AV is Local.\n\nSo the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nBut wait, the base score calculation might have different values.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the WPBakery Page Builder plugin for WordPress. It's due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes. The attacker needs to be authenticated with author-level access or higher to inject scripts, which then execute when users access the affected pages.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the vulnerability is in a plugin for WordPress, which is typically accessed over the network. Since the attacker doesn't need physical access or adjacent network access, AV should be Network (N).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which usually requires the attacker to have some level of access to inject the script. However, once the script is injected, it's stored and executed when users access the page. The complexity here might be low because the attacker just needs to find a way to inject the script, which might be straightforward if the input isn't properly sanitized. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to be authenticated with author-level access. In WordPress, author-level access is a certain privilege, but not the highest. However, the CVSS PR metric considers the level of privileges needed. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated (but not necessarily administrative), this would be Low (L). Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege, so maybe PR is Low. But I need to check the definitions. According to CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated (like a user with author access), that's a privilege, so PR would be Low. If it required admin privileges, that would be High. So here, since author-level is a lower privilege, PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is stored, meaning the attacker injects the script once, and it executes when users access the page. So user interaction is not required for the attack to occur. The user doesn't need to do anything beyond accessing the page. Therefore, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component (the plugin) that the user is interacting with. Since the attack is within the same scope (the plugin's functionality), the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same application.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary scripts. This can allow an attacker to steal session cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on their behalf. Therefore, confidentiality (C) is High (H) because the attacker can access sensitive data. Integrity (I) is also High (H) because the attacker can modify the content or inject malicious scripts. Availability (A) might be Low or None, but since the XSS doesn't directly impact the availability of the service, it's None (N). However, if the script could cause a denial of service, but the description doesn't mention that. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.

The problem is that an attacker could trick users into authorizing sensitive actions unintentionally. \n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the attacker could trick users, which implies that the attack might require some form of user interaction. However, the attack vector here is likely through the network since GitLab is a web application. So AV is probably Network (N).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability allows an attacker to trick users into authorizing actions. If the attack requires a specific trick or social engineering, that might be considered low complexity. But if it's something that requires specific conditions, maybe high. However, since it's about user interaction, maybe it's low. I'll go with Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker doesn't need any special privileges because they're tricking the user into authorizing actions. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says the attacker could trick users into unintentionally authorizing actions, which means user interaction is required. So UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component where the user is interacting, so the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The issue allows unauthorized actions, which could impact all three. If the user authorizes actions, the attacker could access confidential data (C: High), modify data (I: High), or cause denial of service (A: High). But the description doesn't specify which specific aspects are affected. However, since it's about authorizing sensitive actions, it's likely that all three are impacted. So C, I, A are all High (H).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:H.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a payload with an excessively large filename, causing the server to become overwhelmed and unavailable for legitimate users.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the file upload feature of binary-husky/gpt_academic version 3.83. The issue is improper handling of form-data with a large filename, leading to a DoS when an attacker sends a payload with an excessively large filename, causing the server to become unavailable.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in a file upload feature, which is typically accessed over the network. So AV is Network (N). If it required local access or physical access, it would be different, but since it's a web-based upload, it's network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The attacker just needs to send a request with a large filename. That seems straightforward, so AC is Low (L). If it required specific conditions or complex steps, it would be High, but here it's a simple payload.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The description doesn't mention needing any user privileges. The attacker can exploit this without authentication, so PR is None (N). If it required admin rights, it would be High, but here it's none.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The attack doesn't require any interaction from the user. The attacker can send the request directly, so UI is None (N). If the user had to click a link or something, it would be Required, but that's not the case here.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability exists in the same component that's being attacked. If the vulnerability affected a different component or scope, it would be Changed, but here it's the same service.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is None (N) because the vulnerability leads to DoS, not data exposure. The attacker isn't gaining access to data, just causing the service to crash.\n\nIntegrity (I) is also None (N) for the same reason. The attack doesn't alter data integrity, just disrupts availability.\n\nAvailability (A) is High (H) because the vulnerability directly causes a Denial of Service, making the service unavailable. So A is High.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. Wait, but the problem says the vulnerability is a DoS, so Availability is High. But the options for A are None, Low, High. So A is H. The other metrics are as above. Let me double-check each metric again to make sure I didn't mix up any.\n\nYes, AV is Network, AC is Low, PR is None, UI is None, Scope Unchanged, Confidentiality and Integrity None, Availability High. So the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Wait, but the user said to include all base metrics.

The app does not encrypt the GID in messages.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The issue is that on goTenna devices with specific app and firmware versions, the GID (which is the user's phone number by default) isn't encrypted in messages. Since phone numbers are sensitive, this could lead to exposure of personal information.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The problem is that the GID is sent in messages. If the messages are transmitted over a network, then AV would be Network (N). But if it's only accessible locally, like on the device itself, then AV would be Local (L). However, since the GID is part of messages sent between devices, which are likely over a network, AV is probably Network (N).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability doesn't require any specific steps beyond sending the message. If the attacker just needs to intercept the message, that's low complexity. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The app doesn't encrypt the GID, so an attacker doesn't need any special privileges to exploit this. They just need to capture the message. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is inherent in the app's behavior. The user doesn't need to do anything for the vulnerability to be exploited.

This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to perform Arbitrary File Write, enabling them to write arbitrary files to the victim's file system. This can potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by writing malicious files such as `__init__.py` in the Python's `/site-packages/` directory.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the eosphoros-ai/db-gpt version v0.6.0, specifically the web API endpoint POST /api/v1/editor/chart/run. The issue is that it allows execution of arbitrary SQL queries without access control. This can lead to Arbitrary File Write, which might result in Remote Code Execution (RCE) by writing malicious files like __init__.py in Python's /site-packages/ directory.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in a web API, which is accessible over the network. So the attack can be initiated remotely without needing physical access or being adjacent. Therefore, AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says that the API allows execution of arbitrary SQL queries without access control. That suggests that the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps; just sending a crafted SQL query would exploit it. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Since there's no access control mentioned, an attacker doesn't need any prior authentication or privileges. They can exploit this without needing any special permissions. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is in a web API. If the attacker can send a POST request to the endpoint without needing any user interaction, then UI is None (N). But if the user has to be tricked into clicking a link or something, it would be Required (R). However, the description doesn't mention needing user interaction, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the same component that's being attacked. Since the API is part of the application and the exploit doesn't involve a different component, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affected a different component, it would be Changed (C), but here it's the same service.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows writing arbitrary files, which could lead to RCE. If an attacker can write files, they might access sensitive data. However, the main impact here is more about integrity and availability. But since the description mentions RCE, which can lead to data exposure, maybe C is High (H). Wait, but the primary impact here is the ability to write files, which could allow reading or modifying data. However, the CVSS metrics for confidentiality are based on whether the vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to information. Since the vulnerability allows arbitrary file writes, which could be used to exfiltrate data or modify it, but the main issue is the ability to write files. However, the CVSS guidelines might consider that if the vulnerability allows access to confidential data, then C is High. But the description doesn't explicitly mention confidentiality impact. Hmm, maybe I need to think again. The vulnerability allows arbitrary file writes, which could be used to overwrite files, but not necessarily read them. However, if the attacker can write a file that allows them to read other files (like a backdoor), then confidentiality could be compromised. But the primary impact here is more on integrity and availability. However, the CVSS base metrics for confidentiality are based on whether the vulnerability can lead to unauthorized disclosure of information. Since the vulnerability allows writing files, which could be used to exfiltrate data (if the attacker writes a file that contains sensitive data), but that's not directly stated. Alternatively, maybe the confidentiality impact is not directly affected, but the integrity and availability are. Wait, the CVSS 3.1 base metrics for confidentiality (C) are High if the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to information, Low if it's partial, and None otherwise. Since the vulnerability allows writing files, which could be used to modify data, but not necessarily read it. However, if the attacker can write a file that allows them to read other files (like a backdoor), then confidentiality could be impacted. But the description doesn't specify that. So maybe the confidentiality impact is not directly addressed here. However, the RCE could lead to reading data. But the CVSS base score is based on the inherent properties of the vulnerability, not the potential exploitation. The vulnerability allows arbitrary file writes, which could be used to modify data (integrity) or execute code (availability). But confidentiality might not be directly impacted unless the attacker can read data. Since the description doesn't mention confidentiality, maybe C is None (N). Wait, but the CVSS guidelines state that if the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to information, then C is High. However, in this case, the vulnerability allows writing, not reading. So maybe C is None. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS 3.1 guidelines again. The confidentiality impact is High if the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to information, Low if it's partial, and None otherwise. Since the vulnerability allows writing files, which could be used to modify data, but not necessarily read it. Unless the attacker can write a file that allows them to read other files. But the description doesn't mention that. Therefore, maybe C is None (N). However, the RCE could lead to reading data, but that's a secondary effect. The base score is based on the primary impact. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should consider that the vulnerability allows arbitrary file writes, which could be used to overwrite files, but not necessarily read them. Therefore, confidentiality is not directly impacted. So C is None (N). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the attacker can write a file that allows them to read other files (like a backdoor), then confidentiality could be compromised. But that's a chain of events. The base score is based on the inherent properties of the vulnerability, not the potential exploitation. So maybe C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability allows arbitrary file writes, which directly impacts the integrity of the system. The attacker can modify or add files, which is a high impact on integrity. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability allows arbitrary file writes, which could lead to denial of service if the attacker writes files that corrupt the system. However, the description mentions RCE, which could also affect availability. But the primary impact here is the ability to write files, which could be used to overwrite critical system files, leading to system instability or unavailability. Therefore, A is High (H).\n\nWait, but the CVSS 3.1 availability metric is High if the vulnerability can cause a complete loss of availability, Low if partial, and None otherwise. Since the vulnerability allows arbitrary file writes, which could be used to delete or overwrite critical files, leading to system unavailability, then A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: H (High)\nA: H (High)\n\nNow, the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H\n\nWait, but earlier I was confused about C. Let me recheck. The vulnerability allows arbitrary file writes, which could lead to RCE. However, the confidentiality impact (C) is about unauthorized access to information. Since the vulnerability allows writing files, not reading, unless the attacker can use that to read data. But the description doesn't mention that. Therefore, C is None (N). So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.7000000000000011, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the ksmbd component. The issue is a type confusion due to a race condition when using ipc_msg_send_request. The handle is allocated with ksmbd_acquire_id, which uses ida_alloc. The problem arises because req->handle from ksmbd_ipc_login_request and FSCTL_PIPE_TRANSCEIVE ioctl can be the same, leading to type confusion between messages. This results in accessing unexpected memory parts after incorrect delivery. The check for the type of ipc response is missing, allowing this to happen.\n\nNow, I need to map this to the CVSS metrics. Let's go through each metric one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel-level issue, it's likely exploitable remotely. However, the description doesn't mention network access. Wait, the ksmbd is related to SMB (Server Message Block) which is a network protocol. So, if the vulnerability is in the SMB server component, it might be exploitable over the network. So AV is probably Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to a race condition. Exploiting race conditions usually requires precise timing, which might be considered high complexity. But sometimes, if the race is easy to trigger, it could be low. However, the description mentions a type confusion that could be exploited. I think AC is Low (L) because the attacker might not need complex steps to exploit it once the race is triggered.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Since it's a kernel vulnerability, typically, an attacker would need high privileges. But wait, the vulnerability is in the ksmbd component, which is part of the kernel. If the attacker can exploit this, they might not need any privileges because the kernel is already running with high privileges. Wait, but the PR metric is about the level of privileges the attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is in a component that's accessible via a network service (like SMB), then the attacker might not need any privileges. However, if the vulnerability is in the kernel, but the exploit requires user-level access, then PR could be Low or None. Hmm, this is tricky. The description doesn't mention requiring user interaction or specific privileges. Since it's a kernel-level issue, but the exploit might be possible without any user privileges if the service is accessible. But I think in this case, since it's a race condition in the kernel, the attacker might need to have some way to trigger the race, which could be done via the network. So PR is None (N) because no privileges are required to exploit it.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is due to a race condition. If the exploit requires the user to perform an action, then UI would be Required. But the description doesn't mention user interaction. It's a race condition that could be triggered by the attacker sending specific requests. So UI is None (N) because no user interaction is needed.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel) where the attack is initiated. Since the attack is within the same scope (the kernel), S is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed. But here, it's within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows access to unexpected parts of memory, which could lead to information disclosure. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The type confusion could lead to modifying data in unexpected memory locations, which would affect integrity. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability could cause the system to crash or become unstable due to incorrect memory access, affecting availability. So A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network, since it's related to SMB which is network-based)\nAC: L (Low, race condition might be easier to exploit)\nPR: N (No privileges needed, as it's a network service)\nUI: N (No user interaction required)\nS: U (Unchanged, same component)\nC: H (High, memory access leads to confidentiality issues)\nI: H (High, integrity issues from incorrect data)\nA: H (High, availability impact from system instability)\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 5.1000000000000005, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private or draft posts created by Elementor that they should not have access to.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Typer Core plugin for WordPress, allowing information exposure through the 'elementor-template' shortcode. The issue is that there are insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included, enabling authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access or higher to extract data from private or draft posts they shouldn't have access to.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is exploited via a shortcode, which is typically accessed through the web. Since it's a WordPress plugin, the attack would be over the network, so AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The description mentions that the attacker needs to be authenticated with Contributor-level access. However, the exploit doesn't require complex steps beyond using the shortcode. Since the attacker can directly access the shortcode without needing to bypass additional security measures, AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is about the level of access needed. The attacker needs to be authenticated as a Contributor or higher. In CVSS terms, if the attacker needs to have some level of access but not administrative, it's considered Low (L). However, wait, the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). Since the attacker must be authenticated, but not necessarily with high privileges, but the description says \"authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above.\" Contributor is a lower privilege level in WordPress. So PR would be Low (L) because it's not requiring high privileges, but some level of access. Wait, but the CVSS PR metric considers the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to have some privileges (like Contributor), that's Low. If they needed admin, that's High. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is whether the user needs to interact. The vulnerability is via a shortcode, which is part of the plugin's functionality. If the attacker can exploit it without needing the user to take any action, like by crafting a URL or using the shortcode in a way that doesn't require user interaction, then UI is None (N). But if the user has to click on a link or something, it's Required (R). The description says \"authenticated attackers\" can extract data, implying that the attacker is already authenticated and can use the shortcode without needing the user to interact further. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). Since the vulnerability is in the Typer Core plugin and the attack is against the same system (WordPress), the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. The vulnerability allows exposure of data from private or draft posts, which directly affects confidentiality. So C is High (H). Integrity and Availability aren't mentioned in the description, so they are None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Wait, but the PR was a bit confusing. Let me check again. The attacker needs to be authenticated with Contributor access. In CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to have some privileges (like Contributor), that's Low (L). If they needed no privileges, it's None (N). Since the attacker must be authenticated, PR is Low (L). So the metrics are as above.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Wait, but the original answer example had C:H, I:H, A:H. But in this case, the vulnerability only affects confidentiality. The description says \"information exposure,\" which is confidentiality. Integrity and Availability aren't mentioned. So I and A should be N. Therefore, the correct vector is AV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "score": 2.2, "success": true}

We hold ieee->beacon_lock in position (1) of thread 1 and use del_timer_sync() to wait timer to stop, but timer handler also need ieee->beacon_lock in position (2) of thread 2. As a result, rtllib_beacons_stop() will block forever. This patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of spin_lock_irqsave(), which could let timer handler to obtain the needed lock.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's drivers, specifically in the rtl8192e driver. The issue is a deadlock in the rtllib_beacons_stop() function. The deadlock occurs because two threads are trying to acquire the same lock in a way that causes them to wait indefinitely.\n\nSo, the problem is a deadlock between two threads. Let's break down the attack vector. Since this is a kernel-level issue, the attack vector (AV) is likely Network (N) because the kernel handles network drivers. But wait, maybe it's Local (L) since it's a kernel module. Hmm, but kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger the issue through network traffic. However, the description doesn't mention remote exploitation. It's a deadlock in the driver's internal functions. So maybe AV is Local (L) because it requires access to the system to trigger the deadlock. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. If the driver is part of the kernel, and the deadlock is in a function that's called during normal operation, maybe an attacker would need local access to exploit it. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a deadlock that requires specific conditions to be triggered. The attacker would need to create a scenario where two threads are in the specific functions that cause the deadlock. That might be complex, so AC is High (H). But wait, if the deadlock is inherent in the code and can be triggered by normal operations, maybe it's Low (L). However, the description says it's a fix for a deadlock that occurs under certain conditions. So maybe the attacker needs to create a specific scenario, which might be complex. So AC is High (H).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): To exploit this, the attacker would need to have some level of access. Since it's a kernel module, maybe the attacker needs root privileges. But the deadlock is in the driver's code, so perhaps the attacker needs to have the ability to run code that triggers the deadlock. If the code is part of the driver, maybe the attacker needs to have local access and possibly root privileges. So PR is High (H). Wait, but if the deadlock can be triggered by a user-space application, maybe the attacker doesn't need high privileges. However, kernel modules typically require elevated privileges. So PR is High (H).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The deadlock is in the driver's code. If the attacker can trigger it through a user-space application, then UI might be None (N) if it's automatic. But if the user has to perform some action, like running a specific program, then UI is Required (R). The description doesn't mention user interaction, so maybe UI is None (N). But I'm not sure. If the deadlock is triggered by normal system operations, then UI is None. If it requires the user to run a specific command, then Required. Since the CVE is about a deadlock in the driver, which might be triggered by normal operations, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects a different component, it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The deadlock would cause the system to hang or crash, which affects availability. So A is High (H). Confidentiality and Integrity might not be directly impacted unless the system is compromised. Since the deadlock is a denial of service, C and I are None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) because it's a kernel module and requires local access.\nAC: High (H) because triggering the deadlock requires specific conditions.\nPR: High (H) because kernel-level access is needed.\nUI: None (N) as no user interaction is required.\nS: Unchanged (U) since it's within the same component.\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.4000000000000004, "success": true}

Starting in version 2.10.0 and prior to version 2.10.2, a specially crafted document could cause an out of bound read, most likely resulting in a crash. Versions prior to 2.10.0 are not vulnerable. Version 2.10.2 fixes the problem. No known workarounds are available.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the JSON library for Ruby. It affects versions from 2.10.0 up to but not including 2.10.2. The issue is that a specially crafted document can cause an out-of-bound read, leading to a crash. The fix is in version 2.10.2, and there are no known workarounds.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The description mentions that a specially crafted document could exploit this. Since the attack is via a crafted input, which is typically sent over the network (like in a web request), I think AV is Network (N). Unless it's a local exploit, but the problem is with parsing JSON, which is often done over the network. So AV=N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to a crafted document. If the attacker needs to create a specific input to trigger the out-of-bound read, that might be considered low complexity. But if it's complex, maybe high. However, since it's a common type of vulnerability (like buffer overflow) that can be triggered with a specific input, I think AC is Low (L). So AC=L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the JSON parsing. If the attacker doesn't need any special privileges, just sending a malicious JSON document, then PR is None (N). Because the user or application is processing the JSON, and the attacker doesn't need to have elevated privileges. So PR=N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says a specially crafted document could cause the issue. If the user needs to interact, like open a file or visit a webpage, then UI=R. But if the attack can be done without user interaction, like through a network request, then UI=N. The problem is that the JSON is being parsed, which could be in a server context where the user doesn't need to interact. However, if it's a local application that processes JSON files, maybe user interaction is required. But the description doesn't specify. Hmm. The original JSON library is used in Ruby, which could be in various contexts. But since the attack is via a crafted document, which might be a file or data sent over the network. If it's a server-side component, then UI=N. If it's a client-side application, maybe UI=R. But the description doesn't mention user interaction. The default assumption for UI is None unless the attack requires the user to take action. Since the problem is with parsing a document, which could be done without user interaction (like a server processing a request), I think UI=N.\n\nScope (S): The scope is Unchanged (U) if the vulnerability affects the same component that's being attacked. If the vulnerability is in the JSON library, which is part of the application, then the scope is unchanged. If the vulnerability allows access to a different component, then it's Changed. But here, the vulnerability is in the JSON library itself, so the scope is Unchanged. So S=U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability causes an out-of-bound read. An out-of-bound read could potentially expose sensitive data if the memory being read contains confidential information. However, the description says it \"most likely resulting in a crash.\" If the crash is the main effect, maybe confidentiality isn't impacted. But if the out-of-bound read could lead to data leakage, then C=H. However, the description doesn't mention data exposure, just a crash. So maybe C=N. Wait, but the out-of-bound read could be a way to read memory that shouldn't be accessible. If that's the case, then confidentiality could be impacted. But the problem is that the vulnerability is in the JSON parser, and the out-of-bound read might not necessarily expose data. It's a bit ambiguous. However, since the main effect is a crash, maybe the confidentiality impact is low or none. But I need to check the CVSS guidelines. For confidentiality, if the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to information, then it's H. If it's possible but not certain, maybe L. But the description doesn't specify that data is leaked. So maybe C=N. Hmm, this is tricky. Alternatively, if the out-of-bound read could be used to read arbitrary memory, which could lead to information disclosure, then C=H. But the description says \"most likely resulting in a crash,\" which suggests that the primary impact is availability. So maybe C=N. I'll go with C=N for now.\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability is an out-of-bound read, which doesn't directly affect the integrity of data. Unless the read could be used to modify data, but that's not the case here. So I=N.\n\nAvailability (A): The out-of-bound read \"most likely resulting in a crash.\" A crash would definitely impact availability, as the service or application would be unavailable. So A=H.\n\nWait, but the CVSS v3.1 metrics for Availability: High (H) means that the vulnerability would cause a complete loss of availability, such as a denial of service. Since the crash would make the application unavailable, that's a high impact. So A=H.\n\nLet me recap:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nWait, but earlier I was uncertain about C. Let me think again. If the out-of-bound read could allow the attacker to read memory that's not supposed to be accessible, that could lead to information disclosure. However, the description doesn't mention that. The main effect is a crash. So maybe the confidentiality impact is not present. Therefore, C=N.\n\nSo the vector would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the answer example in the user's message had C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem is that the out-of-bound read could be a way to read arbitrary memory, which could lead to information disclosure. However, the description says \"most likely resulting in a crash.\" So the primary impact is availability. But the out-of-bound read could also be a way to read data, which would affect confidentiality. However, the description doesn't state that data is being leaked. So maybe the confidentiality impact is not present. Therefore, C=N.\n\nBut in some cases, even if the vulnerability is a crash, the potential for information disclosure might be considered. However, without explicit mention, it's safer to assume that confidentiality is not impacted. So C=N.\n\nTherefore, the final vector would be:\n\nAV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nBut wait, the example given by the user had C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 guidelines again.\n\nIn CVSS v3.1, the confidentiality, integrity, and availability metrics are each rated as None (N), Low (L), or High (H). For confidentiality, if the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to information, then it's H. If it's possible but not certain, maybe L. If it's not possible, then N.\n\nIn this case, the vulnerability is an out-of-bound read. If the attacker can read arbitrary memory, that would be a confidentiality impact. However, the description doesn't mention that. It just says it causes a crash. So unless the out-of-bound read is a way to read data, which could be a possibility, but the description doesn't confirm that. Therefore, it's safer to assume that confidentiality is not impacted, so C=N.\n\nSame for integrity: the vulnerability doesn't allow modification of data, so I=N.\n\nAvailability is definitely impacted because the crash would make the service unavailable, so A=H.\n\nSo the final vector is:\n\nAV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nBut wait, the example in the user's message had C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. The actual answer depends on the vulnerability's impact.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the out-of-bound read could be used to read sensitive data, which would be a confidentiality impact. However, the description doesn't mention that. The main effect is a crash. So without explicit information, it's safer to assume that confidentiality and integrity are not impacted. Therefore, C=N, I=N, A=H.\n\nSo the vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability during installation, leading to arbitrary folder or file deletion.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. The CVE is about a race condition in Dell Display Manager versions before 2.3.2.20. The vulnerability allows a local malicious user to exploit it during installation, leading to arbitrary file or folder deletion.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each metric step by step. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The description says it's a local malicious user, so the attack is local. That would make AV: Local (L). Wait, but sometimes \"local\" can be confused with adjacent. But the options are Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), Physical (P). Since the user is local, AV is L.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is a race condition. Race conditions typically require specific timing, which might be considered high complexity. But sometimes, if it's a simple race, maybe low. Hmm. The description says \"could potentially exploit this vulnerability during installation.\" If the exploit requires precise timing, that's high. But if it's a simple race that's easy to trigger, maybe low. I think in this case, since it's a race condition, it's more likely to be high complexity. So AC: High (H). Wait, but some sources say race conditions are often considered low. Maybe I need to check. Wait, the CVSS guide says that if the attack requires a specific sequence of events, it's high. If it's a simple race, maybe low. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The user has to perform the installation and trigger the race condition. If the exploit is straightforward, maybe low. But I'm not certain. Maybe I should go with High (H) here. Alternatively, maybe the attack is low because it's a race condition that can be triggered with minimal effort. Hmm. I'll need to make a judgment call here. Let's say AC is Low (L) because race conditions can be exploited with low complexity once the conditions are met. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should check examples. For example, a buffer overflow might be low, but a race condition might be high. I think I'll go with High (H) for AC.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The user is local, so they might need some privileges. But the description says \"local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability during installation.\" If the user is already local, maybe they don't need high privileges. Wait, but during installation, maybe the user has administrative privileges. However, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the user is already local, maybe they need no additional privileges. Wait, but the user is a local user, so maybe they have some level of access. The PR options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the user is local, but the exploit doesn't require elevated privileges, then PR is None. But if the user needs to have certain privileges to perform the installation, maybe PR is Low. However, the description doesn't specify that. It just says a local malicious user. So I think PR is None (N) because the user is already local and doesn't need additional privileges beyond that. Wait, but maybe the installation process requires administrative privileges. If the user is a regular user, they might not have the necessary permissions. But the problem states that the user is malicious and local, so perhaps they have the necessary privileges. This is a bit ambiguous. Maybe PR is Low (L) because the user needs to have some level of access to perform the installation. Alternatively, if the user is already local, maybe they don't need any additional privileges. I think I'll go with PR: None (N) because the user is local and the exploit is during installation, which might be done with existing privileges.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says the user could exploit it during installation. If the user has to interact with the system, like initiating the installation, then UI is Required (R). But if the exploit can be triggered automatically without user interaction, then UI is None. However, the installation process usually requires user interaction. So maybe UI is Required (R). But the vulnerability is a race condition during installation. If the user is the one performing the installation, then they are interacting. So UI: Required (R). But wait, the user is the one who is malicious and initiating the installation. So the exploit requires the user to perform the installation, which is a user interaction. Therefore, UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability is in the Dell Display Manager, which is a local application. If the exploit affects the same component (unchanged scope), then S: Unchanged (U). If it affects a different component, then Changed (C). Since the vulnerability is in the same component, S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A). The impact is arbitrary file or folder deletion. That affects integrity (since files are deleted, which can alter data) and availability (if critical files are deleted, the system might not function). Confidentiality might not be affected unless the deletion is of confidential data, but the description doesn't specify that. So C: None (N), I: High (H), A: High (H). Because deleting files can compromise integrity and availability. If the deletion is arbitrary, it could lead to loss of data (integrity) and system unavailability (availability). So I and A are High. Confidentiality is not mentioned, so C: None.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: H (High) or L? Earlier I was confused. Let me recheck. If the attack is a race condition, which requires specific timing, that's high complexity. But if it's a simple race that can be triggered easily, maybe low. The description says \"could potentially exploit this vulnerability during installation.\" If the user is performing the installation, maybe the race is easy to trigger. For example, during installation, the user could manipulate the process to create a race. So maybe AC is Low. I think I'll go with AC: Low (L) here.\n\nPR: N (None) or L? If the user is local, maybe they don't need additional privileges. So PR: N.\n\nUI: R (Required) because the user has to perform the installation.\n\nS: U (Unchanged)\n\nC: N, I: H, A: H.\n\nSo the vector would be AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H.\n\nWait, but the initial thought was AC: H. Now I'm changing to L. Let me confirm. According to CVSS 3.1, Attack Complexity is Low if the attack requires minimal effort, such as a simple race condition. High if it requires complex steps. So a race condition is typically considered Low. So AC: L.\n\nSo the final metrics:\n\nAV: L\nAC: L\nPR: N\nUI: R\nS: U\nC: N\nI: H\nA: H\n\nVector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.7999999999999998, "success": true}

However, since it's a race condition, which is a specific scenario, maybe AC is High (H). But some sources say race conditions can be low if the attacker can easily trigger them. I need to check. Wait, the CVSS guide says that if the attack requires a specific sequence of events, it's high. But if it's a simple condition, maybe low. Since the race condition is a specific scenario, maybe AC is High. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. If the attacker can exploit it without much effort once the condition is met, maybe it's low. But the race condition itself might require precise timing, which is high. I'll go with High (H) for AC.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability allows cloning private repositories. If the attacker doesn't need any special privileges, like just being a regular user, then PR is None (N). But if they need to be authenticated, maybe Low (L). However, the description says \"private repository to be cloned\", which implies that the attacker might need access to the system. Wait, but the secondary node being out of sync might be a scenario where the attacker can exploit the system without needing elevated privileges. So maybe PR is None (N) because no special privileges are required beyond what a normal user might have. But I'm not sure. If the attacker needs to be authenticated to access the GitLab instance, then PR would be Low. However, the vulnerability is in the system's handling of the secondary node, so maybe the attacker doesn't need any privileges. Hmm. I think PR is None (N) because the attack doesn't require any specific user privileges beyond what's normally allowed.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description doesn't mention that user interaction is required. If the attack can be triggered automatically without user input, then UI is None (N). If the user has to perform an action, like clicking a link, then it's Required (R). Since the race condition is a system-level issue, I think UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component (GitLab EE) and doesn't change the scope. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A). The issue allows cloning private repositories, which would impact confidentiality (C: High) because private data is exposed. Integrity might be affected if the cloned data is modified, but the description doesn't mention that. Availability isn't mentioned either. So C is High (H), I is None (N), A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:H, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Wait, but the attack complexity might be Low. Let me recheck. If the attack is a race condition that can be triggered with a specific sequence, but not necessarily complex, maybe AC is Low. For example, if the attacker can exploit it by timing their request when the secondary node is out of sync, which might be a low complexity. But I'm not sure. The CVSS guide says that if the attack requires a specific sequence of events, it's high. However, if the attack is straightforward once the condition is met, it's low. Since the race condition is a specific scenario, but the actual exploitation might be simple once the condition is met, maybe AC is Low. That would change the AC to L. Let me adjust that. So AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. That seems more accurate. The attack complexity is low because the race condition is a known scenario that can be exploited with minimal effort once the condition is met.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 1.5999999999999996, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Event RSVP plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the 'emd_mb_meta' shortcode. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject scripts, which then execute when users access the affected pages.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in a WordPress plugin, which is typically accessed over the network. Since the attacker doesn't need physical access or adjacent network access, AV should be Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The description mentions that the attacker needs to inject scripts via the shortcode, which might require some specific steps, but since it's a stored XSS, the complexity is likely low. The attacker just needs to find a way to inject the script into the content, which might be straightforward once they have access. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is about the level of access needed. The attacker needs contributor-level access, which in WordPress is a role that allows editing posts but not necessarily full administrative access. However, contributor-level access is considered a low privilege requirement because it's not the highest level. Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). Since the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege, but contributor is a low level. So PR is Low (L)? Wait, but the options for PR are None, Low, High. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege, but the level is low. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but maybe the correct value is Low because the attacker needs to have contributor access, which is a low privilege. Alternatively, if the attacker doesn't need any privileges, but in this case, they do need contributor access. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is whether the user needs to interact for the attack to succeed. Since it's a stored XSS, the attacker injects the script into the content, and when a user accesses that content, the script executes. So the user interaction is not required for the attack to occur once the script is stored. Therefore, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) refers to whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. Since the plugin is part of the WordPress ecosystem, and the attack is within the same application, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed, but here it's within the same application.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. For XSS, the primary impact is on confidentiality and integrity. The attacker can steal session cookies (confidentiality) or manipulate the page (integrity). Availability might not be directly affected unless the XSS causes a denial of service, which isn't mentioned here. So C is High (H) because the attacker can steal sensitive information. I is High (H) because the attacker can alter the content. A is None (N) since there's no mention of availability impact.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the PR was a bit confusing. Let me check again. The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a privilege. The PR metric is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege, but the level is low. So PR is Low (L). So the vector would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. But wait, the original description says \"authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above\". So the attacker needs to be authenticated, which is a privilege. So PR is Low (L) because contributor is a low-level privilege. If it required admin access, that would be High. So yes, PR is Low.\n\nSo the final vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Image Photo Gallery Final Tiles Grid plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the 'FinalTilesGallery' shortcode. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts, which execute when a user accesses the injected page.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means the payload is stored on the server and executed when a user accesses the page. Since the attacker doesn't need to be on the same network or physical location, but the attack is triggered through the web application, the attack vector is Network (N). So AV is N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). Stored XSS typically requires the attacker to have some way to inject the payload, but once that's done, the exploit is straightforward. Since the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps beyond injecting the script, AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The description mentions that the attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher. Contributor-level access in WordPress allows users to create and edit content but not necessarily administrative functions. However, since the attacker needs to be authenticated, PR is Low (L) because it's not requiring high privileges, but not None either. Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). Since the attacker needs to be authenticated, but not necessarily with high privileges, PR is Low (L). Wait, but maybe contributor-level access is considered a low privilege? Or is it considered that the attacker needs to have some level of access, so PR is Low. Hmm. Alternatively, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a requirement, but the privilege level is low. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). Stored XSS doesn't require user interaction because the script is executed when the user accesses the page. However, the user must view the page for the script to run. But in the case of stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact with the script; it's automatically executed when the page is loaded. So UI is None (N) because no user interaction is required beyond the initial access. Wait, but the user has to access the page. However, the UI metric refers to whether the attack requires user interaction. Since the attacker's payload is stored and executed when the user views the page, the user doesn't need to take any action beyond accessing the page. Therefore, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component where the attack is initiated. Since the plugin is part of the WordPress site, and the attack is within the same application context, the scope is Unchanged (U). So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability allows arbitrary script execution, which can lead to stealing session cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the site. This impacts confidentiality (stealing data), integrity (modifying content), and availability (if the script causes the site to crash). However, the CVSS base metrics for C, I, A are based on the impact of the vulnerability. Since the XSS can lead to all three, but the description doesn't specify which ones are affected. However, stored XSS typically allows for all three impacts. But according to the CVSS guidelines, if the vulnerability allows for all three, then each is set to High (H). However, sometimes it's considered that stored XSS primarily affects confidentiality and integrity, but availability might not be directly impacted unless the script causes a denial of service. The description here doesn't mention availability, so maybe A is None (N). Wait, but the CVSS v3.1 impact metrics are based on the potential impact. If the vulnerability allows for arbitrary script execution, which can lead to data theft (C), data modification (I), and potentially DoS (A) if the script is malicious. However, the description doesn't mention availability, so maybe A is None. But the standard for XSS is usually C and I as High, and A as None. So C: H, I: H, A: N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low) because the attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low privilege.\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but I need to check the PR again. The description says \"authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above\". So the attacker needs to be authenticated, which is a requirement. In CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, but the privilege level is low (contributor), then PR is Low (L). If the attacker needed administrative privileges, it would be High. So PR is L.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in Photoshop Elements versions 2025.0 and earlier, related to a temporary file creation with incorrect permissions, leading to privilege escalation. The exploitation requires user interaction, specifically opening a malicious file.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the user must open a malicious file. Since this is done by the user, it's likely through a network or local interaction. But since the user has to open the file, maybe it's a local attack? Wait, but if the file is delivered via email or a network share, maybe it's network-based. However, the attack vector is typically determined by how the attack is initiated. If the user has to open a file, that could be local (L) if the file is on the local system, or network (N) if the file is accessed over a network. But the description doesn't specify. Hmm. However, since the user is interacting with a file, maybe it's considered local. But I'm not sure. Wait, the attack vector is the path the attacker uses to exploit the vulnerability. If the user opens a malicious file, perhaps the attack is initiated via a local file, so AV is Local (L). But sometimes, if the file is delivered via a network (like a web download), it might be Network (N). The description doesn't specify, but the fact that it's a file that the user opens might imply that the attack is local. However, I need to check the standard for AV. For example, if the attack can be done remotely without user interaction, it's N. But here, user interaction is required. So maybe AV is Network (N) if the file is delivered over the network, but if it's a local file, then L. The problem is the description doesn't specify. But in many cases, when a user opens a file, it's considered local. However, sometimes, if the file is delivered via a network, it's considered network. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The attack vector is the method by which the attacker delivers the exploit. If the user has to open a file, perhaps the file is on the local system, so AV is Local (L). But if the file is sent over the network (like via email or a malicious website), then AV is Network (N). Since the description doesn't specify, but the user interaction is required, maybe AV is Network (N) because the user has to open the file, which could be delivered via a network. Alternatively, maybe it's considered local. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me check some examples. For example, if a vulnerability requires the user to open a malicious file, like a PDF, that's typically considered Network (N) because the file is delivered over the network. So I think AV is Network (N).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says the exploitation requires user interaction. But does that mean the attack is complex or not? If the user has to open the file, but once opened, the exploit is automatic, then AC is Low (L). If it requires multiple steps or specific conditions, it's High (H). The description doesn't mention any complexity, so I think AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability allows privilege escalation in the context of the current user. That means the attacker needs the same privileges as the current user. So the attacker doesn't need any special privileges; they just need the user to open the file. Therefore, PR is None (N), because no privileges are required beyond the user's own.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description explicitly states that exploitation requires user interaction (opening a malicious file). So UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability is in the current user's context. Since the attack doesn't change the scope (i.e., it's within the same security boundary), S is Unchanged (U). If the attack could affect other components or systems, it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same user's context, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability allows privilege escalation. Privilege escalation typically affects confidentiality, integrity, and availability. If the attacker can escalate privileges, they can access resources they shouldn't (confidentiality), modify data (integrity), or cause denial of service (availability). However, the description doesn't specify which of these are impacted. But since it's a privilege escalation, it's likely that all three are high. However, the standard for CVSS is that if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain access to data they shouldn't, that's confidentiality (C: H). If they can modify data, that's integrity (I: H). If they can cause the system to crash or be unavailable, that's availability (A: H). But the description only mentions privilege escalation, which is more about access control. However, in CVSS, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain elevated privileges, that can lead to all three impacts. So I think C, I, and A are all High (H). But sometimes, if the vulnerability doesn't directly impact availability, it might be N. But the problem is that the description doesn't specify. However, the standard for CVSS is that if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain access to data, that's confidentiality. If they can modify data, that's integrity. If they can cause the system to be unavailable, that's availability. Since the vulnerability is about privilege escalation, which can lead to all three, but the description doesn't mention any specific impact. However, the default for CVSS is to assume that if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain access to data, then confidentiality is high. But if the vulnerability doesn't directly impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability, then those are N. Wait, but the problem is that the vulnerability allows privilege escalation, which is a security control bypass. So, the attacker can perform actions that they shouldn't be able to. That could include accessing confidential data (C: H), modifying data (I: H), or causing the system to crash (A: H). However, the description doesn't specify which of these are affected. But in the absence of specific information, the standard is to assume that if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain access to data, then confidentiality is high. But if the vulnerability is about privilege escalation without specific impact on data, maybe the impacts are not high. However, the standard for CVSS is that if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain access to data, then confidentiality is high. But in this case, the vulnerability is about privilege escalation, which is a way to gain access to data. So I think C, I, and A are all High (H). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe only confidentiality is high, and the others are N. But the problem is that the description doesn't specify. However, the standard for CVSS is that if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain access to data, then confidentiality is high. If the attacker can modify data, then integrity is high. If the attacker can cause the system to be unavailable, then availability is high. Since the vulnerability is about privilege escalation, which can lead to all three, but the description doesn't specify, I think the best approach is to assume that all three are high. However, in practice, sometimes only confidentiality is considered. But I need to check the CVSS guidelines. According to the CVSS documentation, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain access to data, then confidentiality is high. If the attacker can modify data, then integrity is high. If the attacker can cause the system to be unavailable, then availability is high. Since the vulnerability allows privilege escalation, which can lead to all three, but the description doesn't specify, I think the safest assumption is that all three are high. Therefore, C, I, A are all H.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "score": 3.3000000000000007, "success": true}

A lack of input validation in the Kubernetes integration could allow an authenticated user to cause denial of service..\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The issue is in GitLab CE/EE, affecting various versions. The problem is a lack of input validation in the Kubernetes integration, allowing an authenticated user to cause a denial of service.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions an authenticated user, but it doesn't specify if the attack requires network access. Since it's a Kubernetes integration, which typically runs on a network, and the user is authenticated, I think the attack vector is Network (N). Unless it's a local exploit, but the mention of Kubernetes suggests network-based access.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation. That might be a low complexity attack because the attacker just needs to send malformed input. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user needs to be authenticated. In CVSS, authenticated users are considered to have Low privileges if they need to be logged in but don't have administrative rights. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the user must be authenticated, that's a requirement, but the privilege level here is about the level of access. Since the user is authenticated but not necessarily with high privileges, maybe PR is Low. But I need to check. If the attack requires the user to have some privileges, but the description says \"authenticated user\" which might imply that they have some level of access. However, in CVSS, if the attack requires the user to be authenticated but doesn't need elevated privileges, PR is Low. If the user is already authenticated, maybe it's considered as requiring Low privileges. Hmm, I think PR is Low here.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention needing user interaction. The attack is automated once the user is authenticated. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the Kubernetes integration. If the attack affects the same component (the integration), then the scope is Unchanged (U). If it affects a different component, it's Changed. Since the integration is part of GitLab, and the attack is within that scope, S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability causes a denial of service. So Availability is High (H). Confidentiality and Integrity are not impacted, so they are None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nWait, but the Privileges Required might be a point of confusion. If the user is authenticated, does that mean they have some privileges? In CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the user is already authenticated, but doesn't need any additional privileges beyond that, then PR is Low. However, if the user needs to have specific privileges (like admin), then it's High. The description says \"authenticated user\" which might imply that they have some level of access, but not necessarily high. So PR is Low. Alternatively, if the authentication is a requirement, but the user doesn't need elevated privileges, then PR is Low. So I think PR is Low here.\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the answer example had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, in the example, the user had a DoS, which affects Availability. So in this case, the vulnerability allows a denial of service, so A is High. C and I are not affected, so N. So the final vector is AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But I need to check if the PR is correct. If the user is authenticated, but the attack doesn't require any additional privileges beyond that, then PR is Low. If the user is authenticated, but the attack requires the user to have certain privileges, then it's High. The description says \"authenticated user\" but doesn't specify the level. So I think PR is Low. Therefore, the vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in IBM Maximo MXAPIASSET API version 7.6.1.3, allowing a remote attacker to traverse directories by sending a specially crafted URL with \"dot dot\" sequences. The result is that the attacker can view arbitrary files on the system.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions a remote attacker, so the attack can be initiated over the network. That points to AV:N (Network).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The attacker needs to craft a URL with specific sequences, but there's no indication that this requires complex steps or specific conditions. It seems straightforward, so AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker doesn't need any prior authentication or special privileges. They just send a crafted request. So PR:N (None).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The attack doesn't require any interaction from the user. The attacker can exploit it remotely without needing the user to do anything. Therefore, UI:N (None).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component that's being attacked. Since the API is part of the system and the attack is on the server-side, the scope remains unchanged. So S:U (Unchanged).\n\nConfidentiality (C). The attacker can access arbitrary files, which means they can read sensitive data. That's a High impact on confidentiality, so C:H.\n\nIntegrity (I). The vulnerability allows reading files, not modifying them. So there's no impact on integrity. I:N.\n\nAvailability (A). The vulnerability doesn't affect the availability of the system. The attacker can read files but can't cause the system to crash or become unavailable. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together, the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Wait, but the user interaction was None, and the scope is Unchanged. Let me double-check each metric again to make sure I didn't mix up any.\n\nYes, the attack is remote, low complexity, no privileges needed, no user interaction, scope unchanged. Confidentiality is high because of reading arbitrary files, integrity and availability are none.

The vulnerability arises from improper sanitization of HTML tags in chat history uploads. Specifically, the sanitization logic fails to handle HTML tags within code blocks correctly, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to identity theft or other malicious actions.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a stored XSS in the gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt repository, specifically in version git 20b2e02. The issue is due to improper sanitization of HTML tags in chat history uploads. The attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the user's browser, leading to identity theft or other malicious actions.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means the payload is stored on the server and executed when another user views the content. Since it's stored, the attack vector is likely through the network because the attacker doesn't need to be on the same network or physical proximity. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): XSS vulnerabilities often require the attacker to craft a specific payload. However, if the sanitization is completely bypassed, the complexity might be low. Since the description says the sanitization fails to handle HTML tags in code blocks, it might be a straightforward exploit. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): For stored XSS, the attacker usually doesn't need any special privileges. They just need to upload the malicious content, which might be possible with normal user privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Stored XSS doesn't require user interaction. Once the malicious script is stored, any user viewing the content will execute it. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component where the data is stored and executed. Since the XSS is in the same context (the user's browser), the scope is Unchanged (U). If it was a different component, like a different service, it might be Changed, but here it's the same application.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript, which can lead to identity theft. That implies that the attacker can access sensitive information, so Confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject scripts, which could alter the content or perform actions on behalf of the user. So Integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The description doesn't mention any impact on availability, like DoS. So Availability is None (N).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"potentially leading to identity theft or other malicious actions.\" Identity theft relates to confidentiality, but could also affect integrity if the attacker can modify data. However, the primary impact here is confidentiality (stealing user data) and integrity (executing arbitrary code). But the CVSS metrics for I and C are separate. Since the XSS can steal data (C:H) and also execute code that could alter data (I:H), both are High. Availability isn't mentioned, so A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N\nAC: L\nPR: N\nUI: N\nS: U\nC: H\nI: H\nA: N\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 3.6999999999999993, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Null pointer dereference in the MME of Magma versions up to 1.8.0. The attack is possible via an S1AP Uplink NAS Transport packet missing the ENB_UE_S1AP_ID field, which allows network-adjacent attackers to crash the MME.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions \"network-adjacent attackers,\" which makes me think of the Adjacent (A) vector. But wait, sometimes \"network-adjacent\" can be a bit ambiguous. However, in CVSS, Adjacent typically refers to local network access, like on the same LAN. Since the MME is a network component, an attacker might be on the same network as the MME, so AV is Adjacent (A). But I should double-check. If the attack is over the network (like the internet), it would be Network (N). However, the term \"network-adjacent\" here might imply that the attacker is on the same network as the MME, not over the internet. So AV is A.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is a Null pointer dereference, which usually doesn't require complex steps. The attacker just needs to send a malformed packet. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The description says \"network-adjacent attackers\" can exploit this. If no authentication is needed, then PR is None (N). Since the attacker doesn't need any special privileges, just sending a packet, PR is N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The attack doesn't require any user interaction. The attacker can exploit it remotely without needing a user to click on something. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability is in the MME, which is part of the system. If the vulnerability affects the same component (MME), then the scope is Unchanged (U). If it's in a different component, it would be Changed (C). Since the MME is the target, S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A). The vulnerability causes a crash, which affects availability. The description says the attacker can crash the MME, so Availability is High (H). There's no mention of data leakage or modification, so Confidentiality and Integrity are None (N). Wait, but crashing the system could lead to denial of service, which is availability. So C and I are N, A is H.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:A, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. Wait, but the example in the problem had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, no, the example was just an example. Let me check again. The vulnerability allows crashing the MME, which is a DoS, so Availability is High. But Confidentiality and Integrity are not impacted. So C:N, I:N, A:H.\n\nWait, but sometimes if the vulnerability can lead to a crash, which is a DoS, then A is H. But if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a crash, that's a high impact on availability. So yes, A is H. C and I are N.\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the example in the problem had C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. Let me make sure. The CVE description says the attacker can crash the MME. That's a denial of service, so Availability is High. But Confidentiality and Integrity are not mentioned. So they are N.

This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The CVE is about a stored XSS in IBM CICS TX. First, I need to go through each metric step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the vulnerability is in the Web UI and allows users to embed JavaScript. Since it's a web-based UI, the attack can be done over the network, so AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. Stored XSS usually doesn't require complex steps. The attacker just needs to inject the script, which is straightforward. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability allows users to embed code, implying that the attacker doesn't need any special privileges. They can do this as a regular user. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). Stored XSS doesn't require the user to interact; the script is stored and executed when the user accesses the page. Wait, but stored XSS might require the user to view the page where the script is injected. However, in some cases, like if the script is stored in a database and then rendered, the user interaction might be required. Hmm, but the description says \"users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI\", which suggests that the user (attacker) can inject it, and then when another user views it, the script runs. So maybe UI is Required (R) because the user needs to interact by viewing the page. Wait, but the original attack vector might not require user interaction. Wait, the CVSS 3.1 UI metric is about whether user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. For stored XSS, the attacker injects the script, and then when a user visits the page, the script runs. So the user interaction is required for the attack to be executed. Therefore, UI is Required (R). But I need to be careful here. Some sources say that stored XSS doesn't require user interaction because the script is stored and executed automatically when the page is loaded. However, the user must access the page. So maybe UI is None (N) if the attack can be triggered without any user action. Wait, but the user has to view the page. So maybe UI is Required (R) because the user has to interact by visiting the page. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. According to CVSS guidelines, UI is 'Required' if the attack requires the user to take some action, like clicking a link or viewing a page. In stored XSS, the user (victim) has to view the page where the malicious script is stored. So that's user interaction. Therefore, UI is Required (R). But I've seen conflicting info. Alternatively, maybe it's 'None' if the attack is automatic. Hmm. Maybe I should go with 'Required' here.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability is in the same component (Web UI) and doesn't affect other components. So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are all High (H) because the XSS can lead to credentials disclosure (C), alter functionality (I), and potentially affect availability if the script causes denial of service. But the description specifically mentions credentials disclosure, which is a confidentiality impact. However, the vulnerability allows altering functionality, which is integrity. Availability isn't mentioned, but maybe it's not directly affected. Wait, the description says \"altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.\" So confidentiality is High (H), integrity is High (H), and availability is None (N) unless the XSS can cause a DoS. Since the description doesn't mention availability, I'll set A to None (N). Wait, but the problem says to determine each metric. Let me check again. The vulnerability allows embedding JavaScript, which can steal credentials (C: H), alter functionality (I: H), but no mention of availability. So A is N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but earlier I was confused about UI. If the user has to view the page, then UI is Required. But some sources might say that stored XSS doesn't require user interaction. Let me check the CVSS 3.1 guidelines. According to NIST, for UI, if the attack requires the user to interact (e.g., click a link, view a page), then it's 'Required'. Stored XSS requires the user to view the page, so UI is 'Required'. Therefore, UI is R.\n\nSo the vector would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but the example given in the problem has A:H. Wait, the example is just an example. Let me check the actual impact. The vulnerability allows altering functionality (I: H) and stealing credentials (C: H). Availability isn't mentioned, so A is N. So the final vector is AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nBut I need to confirm the UI again. If the attack is stored, the user doesn't have to do anything except access the page. But the user interaction is required in the sense that the user must view the page. So UI is Required. Therefore, the answer should have UI:R.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

The issue is missing nonce validation, allowing unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary results by tricking a site admin into clicking a link.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the attack can be initiated via a forged request that a user (like an admin) clicks on a link, this is typically a network-based attack. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The vulnerability requires the attacker to craft a malicious link that the user must click. However, there's no need for complex steps beyond creating the link. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) refers to the level of access the attacker needs. Since the attacker is unauthenticated, they don't need any privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is about whether the user needs to interact. The attack requires the user (admin) to click the link, so UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. Since the plugin is part of WordPress, and the attack affects the plugin's functionality, the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. The vulnerability allows deletion of arbitrary results, which affects data integrity. It might also affect availability if the deletion disrupts services, but the main impact is on integrity. However, since the attack can delete data, that's a high impact on integrity. Confidentiality isn't directly affected unless the data is sensitive, but the description doesn't mention that. Availability isn't mentioned either. So C is None (N), I is High (H), A is None (N).\n\nWait, but deleting arbitrary results could also affect availability if the results are critical. But the description doesn't specify that. So maybe A is None. But I need to be careful. The main impact here is integrity because the attacker can alter the data by deleting it. So I would go with I:H, C:N, A:N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:N, I:H, A:N. Then the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N.

Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/628404/\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to analyze the given CVE description and calculate the CVSS v3.1 base score. First, I need to understand the vulnerability described.\n\nThe CVE is about a NULL pointer dereference in the Linux kernel's DRM/MSM/DPU code. The fix involves adding a check to prevent this when the state is dumped without an atomic_check. So, the vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference that could lead to a crash or other issues.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. If the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, AV would be Network (N). But if it requires local access, like a local exploit, then it's Local (L). Since the patch is in the kernel and the issue is during state printing, which might be triggered by certain operations, but I don't see any indication that it's remotely exploitable. So maybe AV is Local (L) or Adjacent (A)? Wait, Adjacent is for local network, but if it's a local exploit, then AV is Local (L). But I need to think about how the vulnerability is triggered. If the user is running code that triggers the state dump without the atomic check, maybe through a local application, then AV is Local. But if it's a kernel vulnerability that can be exploited via a local exploit, then AV is Local. So I think AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): This is about how complex the attack is. If the attacker needs to perform multiple steps or have specific conditions, it's High. If it's straightforward, like a simple buffer overflow, it's Low. A NULL pointer dereference might be exploitable with a simple trigger, so AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have some level of access. If the vulnerability is in the kernel and requires root privileges to exploit, then PR is High (H). But if it's a local exploit that can be triggered by a user with normal privileges, maybe PR is Low (L). However, kernel vulnerabilities typically require root or high privileges. But in this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have the ability to trigger the state dump. If the user can run code that causes the state to be printed without the atomic check, maybe they need local access. So PR is probably Low (L) if the user can trigger it without elevated privileges. Wait, but kernel vulnerabilities usually require some level of privilege. Hmm. Maybe PR is None (N) if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that can be accessed without user privileges. Wait, no. The user would need to have the ability to run code that triggers the state dump. If that's possible without elevated privileges, then PR is Low. But if it requires root, then High. Since the patch is in the kernel, and the state dump is part of the DRM subsystem, which might be accessible by user-space applications, maybe the attacker can trigger this without needing root. So PR is Low (L) or None (N)? Wait, PR is the level of privileges required. If the attacker doesn't need any special privileges, like a regular user can exploit it, then PR is None (N). But if they need to have some privileges, like being a local user, then PR is Low. I think in this case, since it's a local kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need to have local access, but not necessarily elevated privileges. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but the CVSS PR metric for kernel vulnerabilities: if the exploit requires local access but not elevated privileges, then PR is Low. If it requires root, then High. But I'm not sure. Maybe the default for kernel vulnerabilities is that they require local access but not necessarily root. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Does the attack require user interaction? If the vulnerability is triggered by a user action, like a specific input, then UI is Required (R). If it can be triggered automatically, then None (N). The description mentions that the state is dumped without a corresponding atomic_check. If this is something that can be triggered by a user application, then UI is Required. But if it's an automatic process, maybe not. However, the patch is to prevent the NULL dereference when the state is dumped. So the user would need to trigger the state dump, which might require some interaction. So UI is Required (R). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that's accessed by user-space code, maybe the user needs to run a specific application that triggers the state dump. So UI is Required (R). But if the vulnerability is in a part that's automatically called, maybe UI is None. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. I think in this case, since the state dump is part of the DRM subsystem, which might be used by user applications, the attacker would need to run code that causes the state to be printed. So UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S): This is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit would affect the kernel's state, the scope is Unchanged (U). So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): These are the impact metrics. The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which can lead to a crash (availability), but not necessarily data exposure (confidentiality) or data modification (integrity). However, if the crash can be exploited to cause a denial of service, then A is High (H). But if it's just a crash that doesn't allow for further exploitation, maybe A is Low (L). However, in CVSS, if the vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service, then A is High. But the impact is on availability. So A: H. For confidentiality and integrity, since the vulnerability is a NULL dereference, it's unlikely to impact confidentiality or integrity unless it's used to escalate privileges. So C: N, I: N, A: H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about UI. If the user needs to run a specific application to trigger the state dump, then UI is Required. But if it's a local exploit that can be triggered without user interaction, like through a system call, then UI is None. However, the description doesn't specify. Maybe the default for kernel vulnerabilities is that UI is None, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that's accessed by user-space code, then the user would need to interact with the system to trigger it. So UI: R. But I'm not certain. Let me check some examples. For example, a local kernel vulnerability that requires a user to run a specific exploit would have UI: R. If it's a vulnerability that can be triggered automatically, like through a system call, then UI: N. Since the patch is about a state print that's done when the state is dumped, which might be part of a user-space application's interaction with the DRM subsystem, the user would need to perform an action that causes the state to be printed. Therefore, UI: R.\n\nSo the final vector would be:\n\nAV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nBut wait, the CVSS v3.1 base score calculation also depends on the impact metrics. However, the user only asked for the base metrics, not the actual score. So the vector string is as above. Let me check again.\n\nAnother thought: If the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit requires local access (AV:L), but the user doesn't need to have any special privileges (PR:N?), but I thought earlier PR was Low. Wait, the Privileges Required metric: if the attacker needs to have no privileges, then PR:N. If they need to have low privileges (like a regular user), then PR:L. If they need high (like root), then PR:H. In this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have the ability to trigger the state dump. If that's possible without elevated privileges, then PR:N. But if the state dump is part of a system call that requires certain permissions, then PR:L or H. However, the patch is in the kernel, and the state dump is part of the DRM subsystem, which might be accessible by user-space applications. So the attacker could be a regular user who runs an application that triggers the state dump. Therefore, PR:N (None) because no privileges are required. Wait, but that might not be correct. Because to access the DRM subsystem, the user might need to have certain permissions. For example, in Linux, DRM is typically accessed by applications with the appropriate permissions, which might require being part of a group or having specific capabilities. However, if the vulnerability can be triggered by a regular user without any special privileges, then PR:N. But if it requires some level of privilege, like being a member of a group, then PR:L. This is a bit ambiguous. However, in the absence of specific information, I might default to PR:L (Low) if the attacker needs to have local access but not necessarily elevated privileges. Alternatively, if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that's accessible by any user, then PR:N.

The verification token used for sending SMS through a goTenna server is hardcoded in the app.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description. The issue is that the verification token for sending SMS via a goTenna server is hardcoded in the app version 5.5.3 and firmware 1.1.12. \n\nSo, the problem is that the token is hardcoded, which means an attacker could potentially use that token to send SMS messages without needing to authenticate. Let's break down each metric.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The token is hardcoded in the app, which is a software component. Since the app is likely running on a device that's connected to the network (like a smartphone), an attacker could exploit this remotely. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The attack requires knowing the hardcoded token. If the token is easily accessible (like in the app's code), then the complexity is low. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any special privileges to exploit this. They just need to know the token. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack doesn't require any user interaction. The attacker can exploit it without the user doing anything. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the app, which is part of the same component as the SMS sending functionality. So the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The hardcoded token might allow unauthorized access to send SMS, which could lead to unauthorized communication. But does it affect confidentiality? Maybe not directly. Wait, the token is for authentication, so if an attacker uses it, they can impersonate the app. That might allow them to send messages without authorization, which could be a confidentiality issue if the messages are sensitive. Hmm, but the main impact here is on integrity and availability. Wait, the problem is that the token is hardcoded, so an attacker can use it to send SMS. That could be used to send messages without authorization, which might be a confidentiality issue if the messages are confidential, but more likely, it's about unauthorized actions. Maybe the confidentiality impact is low or none. Wait, the CVSS metrics for confidentiality, integrity, and availability are about the impact on the system. If the token is used to send SMS, the attacker can send messages, which might be a violation of integrity (since they can send messages that shouldn't be sent) or availability (if they send a lot of messages, causing denial of service). But the original description doesn't mention any of these. The main issue is that the token is hardcoded, which allows unauthorized access. So, the confidentiality impact might be low if the attacker can access the system's resources, but maybe the main impact is on integrity and availability. Wait, the CVSS impact metrics are about the effect on the system. If the attacker can send SMS messages, that could be a violation of integrity (since they can send messages that shouldn't be sent) or availability (if they send messages to overwhelm the system). However, the description doesn't specify that. The problem is that the token is hardcoded, which allows unauthorized access. So, the confidentiality impact might be low or none. But maybe the main impact is on integrity (since the attacker can send messages without authorization) and availability (if they can send messages to cause disruption). However, the original description doesn't mention any of these. The vulnerability is that the token is hardcoded, which is a security flaw that allows unauthorized access. So, the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability would be high if the attacker can exploit this to gain access. But I need to think carefully. \n\nWait, the CVSS impact metrics are about the effect on the system. If the attacker can use the hardcoded token to send SMS, they can perform actions that the app is supposed to restrict. This could lead to unauthorized message sending, which might be a violation of integrity (since the messages are not authorized) or availability (if the attacker sends a lot of messages, causing the service to be unavailable). However, the original description doesn't mention any of these. The problem is that the token is hardcoded, which is a vulnerability that allows unauthorized access. So, the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability would be high if the attacker can exploit this to gain access. But without more details, I need to make an educated guess. \n\nIn many cases, a hardcoded token that allows unauthorized access would be considered a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. However, if the token is used for authentication, then the attacker can impersonate the app, which might allow them to perform actions that the app is supposed to do. For example, sending SMS messages. This could be a high impact on integrity (since the attacker can send messages that shouldn't be sent) and availability (if they send messages to overwhelm the system). But again, the description doesn't specify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the impact is on confidentiality if the attacker can access the system's resources. But I'm not sure. In the absence of specific information, I might have to assume that the impact is high on all three metrics. However, sometimes, if the vulnerability allows unauthorized access but doesn't directly compromise data, the confidentiality impact might be low. \n\nWait, the CVSS 3.1 impact metrics are based on the potential impact of the vulnerability. If the attacker can use the hardcoded token to send SMS messages, that could be a high impact on integrity (since they can send messages that shouldn't be sent) and availability (if they can send messages to cause a denial of service). However, the confidentiality impact might be low or none unless the attacker can access confidential data. \n\nBut the original description doesn't mention any of these. The problem is that the token is hardcoded, which is a vulnerability that allows unauthorized access. So, the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability would be high if the attacker can exploit this to gain access. However, without more details, I need to make an educated guess. \n\nIn many cases, a hardcoded token that allows unauthorized access would be considered a high impact on all three metrics. However, I need to check the standard approach. For example, if the vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication, that's a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. \n\nSo, I think the correct values would be C: High, I: High, A: High. But I need to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, if the attacker can send SMS messages, that's a high impact on integrity (since they can send messages that shouldn't be sent) and availability (if they can send messages to overwhelm the system). But confidentiality might not be affected unless the messages contain confidential data. \n\nBut the problem is that the token is used for authentication. If the attacker can use the token, they can impersonate the app and send messages. This could be a high impact on integrity (since the messages are unauthorized) and availability (if they send a lot of messages).

If the attacker can send messages, that's a high impact on integrity and availability. However, the confidentiality impact might be low or none. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. In some cases, if the attacker can access the system's resources, confidentiality might be considered high. However, without more information, I think the safest assumption is that the impact on confidentiality is low or none, and the impact on integrity and availability is high. \n\nWait, but the CVSS impact metrics are based on the potential impact. If the attacker can use the token to send SMS, that's a high impact on integrity (since they can send messages that shouldn't be sent) and availability (if they can send messages to cause a denial of service). However, the confidentiality impact might be low unless the messages contain confidential data. \n\nBut the original description doesn't mention any of these. So, perhaps the impact is high on all three. However, I need to think about the standard approach. \n\nIn the absence of specific information, the default for impact metrics is usually High if the vulnerability allows unauthorized access.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JP2 files.The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25564.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to go through the CVE description and identify each metric based on the given options.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description says it's a remote vulnerability where the attacker needs the target to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. Since it's remote and doesn't require physical access, AV should be Network (N).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is a use-after-free, which typically requires specific conditions to exploit. However, the description mentions that user interaction is required, but doesn't specify if the attack is complex. Since it's a parsing issue that might be exploitable with a crafted file, I think AC is Low (L) because it's not highly complex once the user is tricked into opening the file.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker doesn't need any special privileges; the user just needs to open the malicious file. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description clearly states that user interaction is required (visit a malicious page or open a malicious file), so UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability is in the application itself, and the impact is within the same process. Since the scope doesn't change (the attack doesn't affect other components or systems), S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability allows information disclosure, which affects confidentiality. The description also mentions that the attacker can leverage this with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code, which would impact integrity and availability. However, the primary issue here is information disclosure. But since the CVSS base score considers the maximum impact, if the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, that would imply all three (C, I, A) are High (H). Wait, but the main issue is information disclosure. However, the note says \"leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.\" So maybe the primary impact is information disclosure (C:H), but the other metrics (I and A) might be Low or None unless the vulnerability itself directly affects them. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The original vulnerability is an information disclosure, but the exploit requires combining with other vulnerabilities. So the base score should reflect the direct impact of the vulnerability. Since the vulnerability allows disclosure of sensitive information, C is High. However, the other metrics (I and A) might not be directly impacted unless the vulnerability itself allows modification or denial of service. The description doesn't mention integrity or availability issues directly, so I and A might be None. Wait, but the note says that the attacker can leverage this with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code. But that's not part of the base score calculation. The base score is based on the inherent properties of the vulnerability, not the potential for chaining. So the primary impact here is information disclosure (C:H), and I and A are None unless the vulnerability itself allows those. Since the description doesn't mention integrity or availability issues, I and A would be None. Wait, but the CVSS v3.1 base score considers the maximum of the three (C, I, A). If the vulnerability can be used to execute arbitrary code, that would imply all three are High. But the description says \"leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.\" So the vulnerability itself doesn't directly allow arbitrary code execution; it's a prerequisite. Therefore, the base score should only consider the direct impact, which is information disclosure (C:H), and I and A as None. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. The base score is based on the inherent characteristics of the vulnerability. If the vulnerability allows information disclosure, then C is High. If the vulnerability can be used to modify data (integrity) or cause a denial of service (availability), then those would be High. Since the description doesn't mention those, I and A are None. So C:H, I:N, A:N. But wait, the note says that the attacker can leverage this with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code. However, that's not part of the base score. The base score is for the vulnerability itself, not the combined effect. So the base metrics would be C:H, I:N, A:N. But I'm not sure. Maybe the fact that it's a use-after-free could imply that it's possible to exploit for arbitrary code execution, but the description says it requires other vulnerabilities. So maybe the base score doesn't include that. Therefore, the base metrics would be C:H, I:N, A:N. But I need to be careful here. Alternatively, if the vulnerability is a use-after-free, which is a common vector for arbitrary code execution, but the description says it's used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities. So the base score might not include I and A as High. Therefore, I and A are None. So the final metrics would be:\n\nAV: N\nAC: L\nPR: N\nUI: R\nS: U\nC: H\nI: N\nA: N\n\nWait, but the CVSS v3.1 base score calculation for confidentiality, integrity, and availability is based on the maximum of the three. If the vulnerability allows information disclosure (C:H), then even if I and A are N, the base score would still have C:H. So the vector would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But I need to confirm the UI. The user interaction is required, so UI is R. That's correct. So the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But wait, the original problem says to determine each metric. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user interaction is required, so UI is R. The scope is unchanged (U). The attack vector is network (N). Attack complexity is low (L) because the attacker can exploit it by getting the user to open a malicious file, which is not complex. Privileges required is none (N). Confidentiality is high (H) because of information disclosure. Integrity and availability are none (N) because the vulnerability itself doesn't directly impact them. So the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But I need to make sure that the base score calculation is correct. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 formula.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Note: Since the widget code isn't part of the code base, to apply the patch, the affected widget: Transparent Split Hero must be deleted and reinstalled manually.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Unlimited Elements For Elementor plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the Transparent Split Hero widget. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts, which execute when a user accesses the affected page.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject scripts through the plugin's widget. Since it's a web application, and the attack can be done remotely via the web, the attack vector is Network (N). Even though the attacker needs to be authenticated, the initial attack vector is still over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description mentions that the attacker needs to have contributor-level access. However, the exploit doesn't require complex steps beyond injecting the script. Since the attacker can exploit it with a simple request once authenticated, the complexity is Low (L). If it required multiple steps or specific conditions, it might be High, but here it's straightforward once access is obtained.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low level of privilege in WordPress. Contributor can publish posts but not edit others' content. However, in CVSS, \"Low\" is for when the attacker needs to have some level of access, but not high. Since contributor is a standard user role, PR is Low (L). Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). Wait, the attacker needs to be authenticated, so they need some privileges. But in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a requirement, but the actual privilege level is considered. Since contributor is a low privilege, PR is Low (L). However, if the attacker needs to have administrative privileges, that would be High. But here, contributor is a lower level, so PR is Low.\n\nWait, but the CVSS PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a requirement, but the actual privilege level is considered. For example, if the attacker needs to be a user with certain permissions, that's PR: Low. If they need admin rights, that's High. Since contributor is a standard user role, PR is Low (L). So I think PR is Low here.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is stored, meaning the attacker injects the script into the page, and when a user accesses the page, the script executes. However, the user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. Wait, no. In stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact with the attacker's input. The script is stored on the server and executed when the user views the page. However, the user interaction here refers to whether the user needs to take some action, like clicking a link. In this case, the user just accesses the page, so UI is None (N). Wait, but the attacker needs to have the user access the page. However, the UI metric is about whether the user needs to interact with the attack. For example, if the attack requires the user to click on a link, that's Required (R). But in stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact; the script is executed automatically when the page is loaded. Therefore, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the plugin) that the attacker is interacting with. Since the attack is within the same security scope (the plugin's widget), the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component (like a different system or service), it would be Changed (C). Here, it's within the same application, so S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability allows arbitrary script execution, which can lead to stealing session cookies (confidentiality), altering content (integrity), or causing denial of service (availability). However, the primary impact here is on confidentiality and integrity. Since the attacker can inject scripts that read data (like cookies) or modify the page content, both C and I are High (H). Availability might not be directly impacted unless the script causes the page to crash, but the description doesn't mention that. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but earlier I thought PR was Low. Let me double-check. The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a privilege. In CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a requirement, but the actual privilege level is considered. Since contributor is a low-level privilege, PR is Low (L). So that's correct.\n\nAnother point: the UI. Since the user doesn't need to interact with the attack (the script is stored and executed when the page is loaded), UI is None. So that's correct.\n\nSo the final vector string is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem handling. The issue arises when resizing a corrupt ext4 image that has the resize_inode feature cleared without running e2fsck. This leads to a NULL pointer dereference during the resize process.\n\nSo, the problem is a NULL pointer dereference, which is a type of memory corruption vulnerability. The exploit would require specific conditions: the filesystem must be in a certain state (resize_inode feature cleared, not run e2fsck), and the user would need to perform certain steps to trigger the bug. \n\nNow, let's go through each metric step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is triggered through the resize2fs command, which is typically run on a mounted filesystem. Since this is a local operation, the attack vector is Local (L). However, wait, the user might have to have access to the system to perform these steps. But if the system is compromised, maybe it's a local exploit. But the original description doesn't mention network access. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The steps to reproduce the issue are specific. The user has to create a filesystem, clear the resize_inode feature, mount it, and then resize. This requires some knowledge and specific steps, but not necessarily complex. However, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so maybe it's low complexity. But since the attack requires precise conditions, maybe it's high? Hmm. Wait, the AC metric in CVSS v3.1 considers whether the attack requires complex steps. If the attacker needs to perform multiple steps and have specific conditions, that's high. But if it's straightforward once the conditions are met, it's low. In this case, the steps are somewhat involved, but once the filesystem is in the right state, the resize2fs command would trigger it. So maybe AC is Low (L) because the attack is straightforward once the conditions are met. Or is it High? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The attack requires the user to have a specific setup, but once that's done, the exploit is simple. So maybe AC is Low. I'll go with Low (L) for AC.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user needs to have root privileges to perform operations like mkfs.ext4, tune2fs, and resize2fs. So the attacker would need to have administrative privileges. Therefore, PR is High (H). Wait, but if the vulnerability is in the kernel, maybe it's possible to exploit it without high privileges? No, because the steps require running commands that need root access. So PR is High (H).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The user has to perform the steps to trigger the vulnerability. So user interaction is required. Therefore, UI is Required (R). But wait, the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit is triggered by the user running resize2fs. So yes, user interaction is needed. So UI is R.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel) that is being attacked. So the scope is Unchanged (U). Because the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit doesn't involve a different component. So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability leads to a NULL pointer dereference, which could cause a denial of service. However, if the system crashes, it might not directly impact confidentiality. But if the system is compromised, maybe data could be accessed. However, the primary impact here is a crash, not data exposure. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the vulnerability doesn't directly affect the integrity of the data. It's a crash, not data corruption. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability causes a denial of service (system crash) when the resize operation is performed. So A is High (H), because the system becomes unavailable.\n\nWait, but the CVSS metrics for availability: High (H) means the system is completely unavailable, Low (L) is partial. Since the system crashes, that's a complete denial of service, so A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: H (High)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nNow, the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nWait, but I need to check if the attack vector is actually Local. The vulnerability is in the kernel, so an attacker would need local access to the system to perform the steps. Therefore, AV is Local (L). That makes sense. So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.2999999999999998, "success": true}

However, this approach created a race condition between the DRM scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence is signaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed. This results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns a new job to the pointer. This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns it to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an interrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.

First, I need to understand the vulnerability described in the CVE. The issue is a race condition in the Linux kernel's DRM/V3D component. The problem arises from a race between the DRM scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. When the fence is signaled in the IRQ thread, a new job starts, but there's a race where the job pointer might be set to NULL by the IRQ thread while the run_job() function is assigning a new job. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash.\n\nNow, I need to map this to the CVSS v3.1 metrics. Let's go through each metric one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel-level issue, an attacker would need to have access to the system to exploit it. However, the vulnerability is in the DRM component, which might be accessible via user-space applications. But the race condition is internal to the kernel. Wait, but the attack vector here is whether the exploit can be triggered remotely or requires local access. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the race condition is between internal threads, I think the attack vector is Local (L). But wait, maybe not. If an attacker can trigger the race condition through a user-space application that uses DRM, then maybe it's Network (N) if it's accessible over the network. However, the description doesn't mention remote exploitation. It's more likely that this is a local vulnerability, requiring local access to the system. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a race condition that requires precise timing between two threads. Exploiting this would need the attacker to have control over both threads, which might be complex. However, if the attacker can trigger the race condition through a specific sequence of operations, maybe it's considered Low (L). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the attacker needs to have specific conditions to trigger the race, maybe it's High (H). Hmm. The description says that the race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. If the attacker can reliably trigger this race, then AC might be Low. But if it's difficult to synchronize the two threads, then High. I think in this case, since it's a race condition that's inherent in the code, the attacker might need to have some control over the execution flow, which could be considered Low. But I'm a bit uncertain here. Maybe I should go with Low (L) for AC.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so an attacker would need to have elevated privileges to exploit it. However, if the vulnerability can be triggered by a user-space application, then maybe the required privileges are Low (L) or None (N). Wait, the kernel is running with high privileges, so if the attacker can trigger the race condition from user space, they might not need any special privileges. But the race condition is between internal kernel threads. So, perhaps the attacker needs to have some way to trigger the race, which might require local access but not necessarily elevated privileges. However, since the kernel is protected, maybe the attacker needs to have local access (like a user with local privileges) to exploit this. So PR could be None (N) if the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, but I think that's unlikely. Alternatively, if the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system, maybe PR is Low (L). Wait, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so if an attacker can exploit it, they might gain higher privileges. But the question is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already on the system (local), then PR is None. But if the attacker needs to have some privileges to trigger the race, then it's Low. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the race condition is between internal threads. To trigger this, the attacker would need to have a way to cause the race condition. If the attacker is a local user, they might be able to trigger this by using the DRM interface. So, the attacker would need local access but not necessarily elevated privileges. Therefore, PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges beyond being a local user. Wait, but in the kernel, even local users might need to have certain capabilities. Hmm. Maybe PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system, but not root. Alternatively, if the attacker can exploit this without any privileges, then PR is None. I think in this case, since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the exploit would require local access, PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to have any specific privileges beyond being a local user. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check standard CVSS examples. For example, kernel vulnerabilities that can be exploited by local users often have PR as None (N) if they don't require any additional privileges beyond being a local user. So I'll go with PR: None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a race condition that can be triggered by the attacker's actions. If the attacker needs to interact with the system (e.g., run a specific application that triggers the race), then UI is Required (R). However, if the vulnerability can be exploited automatically without user interaction, then UI is None (N). The description doesn't mention user interaction being required. The race condition is between internal threads, so maybe the attacker can trigger it through a specific sequence of operations in a user-space application, which would require user interaction. Therefore, UI is Required (R). But if the attacker can exploit it without user interaction, like through a system service, then UI is None. I think in this case, since the attacker would need to perform actions that cause the race condition, which might require user interaction, UI is Required (R). However, if the race can be triggered by a background process, then UI is None. I'm a bit torn here. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the race condition is between the DRM scheduler and the IRQ thread. If the attacker can send a specific request to the DRM interface, which would trigger the race, then that would require user interaction. So UI is Required (R). But if the attacker can exploit it through a system call or a background process, then UI is None. Since the description doesn't specify, but the race is between internal threads, maybe the attacker can exploit it without user interaction. Hmm. I think I need to make a judgment here. If the vulnerability can be exploited by a local user without any user interaction, then UI is None. But if the user has to perform an action, like running a specific application, then UI is Required. Since the description doesn't mention user interaction, but the race is between internal threads, I think UI is None (N). Wait, but the attacker would need to have a way to trigger the race condition, which might require some user action. For example, using a DRM application that causes the race. Therefore, UI is Required (R). I think I'll go with UI: Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel) that is being attacked. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the exploit would affect the same component, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, then it would be Changed (C). So S: Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability leads to a NULL pointer dereference, which causes a crash. This would result in a denial of service (availability impact). However, the description doesn't mention any impact on confidentiality or integrity. The crash is an availability issue. So C: None (N), I: None (N), A: High (H) because the system crashes, which is a high impact on availability. Wait, but the CVSS metrics for availability are High (H) if the system is completely unavailable, Low (L) if there's a partial loss, and None (N) if there's no impact. Since the crash would cause the system to crash, which is a complete loss of availability, so A: High (H). However, if the crash is temporary and the system can be restarted, maybe it's Low. But in the context of CVSS, a crash that requires a reboot is considered High. So A: High (H). For confidentiality and integrity, since the vulnerability doesn't leak data or modify data, those are None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) – because the vulnerability is in the kernel and requires local access to exploit.\nAC: Low (L) – the race condition can be triggered with a specific sequence of events, which might be considered low complexity.\nPR: None (N) – the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges beyond being a local user.\nUI: Required (R) – the attacker needs to perform actions that trigger the race condition, which might require user interaction.\nS: Unchanged (U) – the vulnerability affects the same component.\nC: None (N) – no impact on confidentiality.\nI: None (N) – no impact on integrity.\nA: High (H) – the crash leads to a denial of service.\n\nWait, but earlier I was considering UI as Required (R) or None (N). Let me recheck that. If the attacker can trigger the race condition through a user-space application, then the user would need to interact with that application. So UI is Required. However, if the attacker can exploit it through a system service or a background process without user interaction, then UI is None.", "prediction": "", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

Versions 3.7.0, 2.3.5, 2.1.6, and 1.29.7 contain a patch for the issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The issue is in PhpSpreadsheet, a PHP library for handling spreadsheets. The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization in a specific file, leading to a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The affected versions are before certain patches, and the patched versions are mentioned.\n\nSo, the main thing here is that the vulnerability allows XSS. Let's recall what each CVSS metric entails.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in a web application (as it's a PHP library used for handling files, and the sample file is online), the attack would typically be over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): XSS vulnerabilities often require the attacker to craft a specific payload, but if it's a simple case where the input isn't sanitized, maybe the complexity is low. However, sometimes XSS might require user interaction. Wait, but the description says \"possibility of a cross-site scripting attack\" without specifying if user interaction is needed. Hmm. But in general, XSS can be low complexity if the attacker can inject script into a page that's rendered to a user. But I need to check if the attack requires user interaction. Let's hold that thought for UI.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): For XSS, the attacker doesn't need any privileges. The user's browser is the one executing the script. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): For XSS, user interaction is typically required. The user has to visit the malicious link or page. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but some XSS can be reflected without user interaction if the script is injected into a page that's automatically loaded. However, in most cases, especially in web applications, the user has to interact with the page. So I think UI is Required here.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the application itself, so the scope is Unchanged (U). Because the vulnerability doesn't affect other components outside the application's scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): XSS can lead to data leakage (C: High), data modification (I: High), or denial of service (A: Low or None). But in this case, the main impact is on confidentiality and integrity. Since XSS can steal cookies or session data (C: High), and inject malicious scripts that alter content (I: High). Availability might not be affected unless the XSS causes a DoS, which isn't mentioned here. So C and I are High, A is None.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low) – because the attack is straightforward once the user is tricked into visiting the malicious page.\nPR: N (None)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but I need to check if UI is Required. If the attack requires the user to interact, then UI is R. But in some cases, if the XSS is stored, maybe the user doesn't need to interact, but in this case, the sample file is online, so maybe the user has to visit the URL. So UI:R is correct.\n\nWait, but the original description says \"possibility of a cross-site scripting attack\" without specifying if it's stored or reflected. However, the sample file is part of the application, so maybe it's a reflected XSS. Reflected XSS typically requires user interaction (e.g., clicking a link). So UI:R is correct.\n\nSo the final vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

Version 3.4.6 fixes the issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the WeGIA application's pre_cadastro_atendido.php endpoint, specifically in the msg_e parameter. The fix was in version 3.4.6.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since it's a reflected XSS, the attack is typically delivered through a web request. The user would have to visit a malicious link, which is usually over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. Reflected XSS usually doesn't require complex steps.

However, I need to check if all three are affected. For example, in a reflected XSS, the main impact is on confidentiality and integrity, but availability might not be directly affected unless the script causes the site to crash. But the standard for XSS is usually C and I as High, and A as None. Wait, the original question says to choose between N, L, H. So maybe A is None here. Let me think again. The vulnerability allows script injection, which can steal cookies (C), modify content (I), but not necessarily affect availability. So A is None (N). But I need to confirm. The CVSS guidelines for XSS: typically, the impact metrics are C:H, I:H, A:N. Because the attack doesn't directly impact the availability of the system, just the data and integrity. So I'll go with C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nWait, but the user might have to interact, but the availability isn't directly impacted. So A is None.

First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The issue is about restoring a maliciously crafted backup file leading to modification of protected system files. The fix is in specific iOS and iPadOS versions.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions restoring a backup file, which can be done remotely, so I think AV is Network (N). Because the attacker doesn't need physical access; they can send the backup file over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The vulnerability requires the attacker to craft a specific backup file. If it's straightforward, like just sending a file, then AC is Low (L). If it's complex, maybe High. But since it's about a crafted backup, which might not be too complex, I'll go with Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The user needs to restore the backup. If the user has to perform an action, like restoring, but the system doesn't require any special privileges, then PR is None (N). Wait, but the user might need to have some permissions to restore backups. However, the description says \"restoring a maliciously crafted backup file may lead to modification...\" which implies that the user is the one initiating the restore, but the system's handling of the backup is the issue. So maybe the attacker doesn't need privileges, just the user's action. So PR is None.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The user has to restore the backup, which requires interaction. So UI is Required (R). Because the attacker needs the user to perform the restore action.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the system files, which are part of the same component. So the scope is Unchanged (U).

The issue allows modification of protected system files, which affects Integrity (I) as High (H). Confidentiality might not be impacted unless the files are accessed, but the description says modification, so C is None (N). Availability isn't mentioned, so A is None (N).

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the FL3R Accessibility Suite plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the plugin's shortcode. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts, which execute when a user accesses the affected page.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means the payload is stored on the server and executed when a user accesses the page. Since the attacker doesn't need to be on the same network or physical location, but the attack is triggered through the web application, the attack vector is Network (N). So AV is N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). Stored XSS typically requires the attacker to have some level of access to inject the payload, but once that's done, the exploit is straightforward. However, the attacker needs to be authenticated. But the AC metric in CVSS v3.1 considers the complexity of the attack. Since the attacker just needs to inject the script once, and the execution is automatic upon access, the complexity is Low (L). So AC is L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The description says the attacker needs contributor-level access or higher. In WordPress, contributor access allows editing posts but not necessarily full administrative privileges. However, the attacker must be authenticated. Since the attacker needs some level of privilege (not none), but not high, PR is Low (L). Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. But contributor-level access is a specific privilege. However, in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. But the options are N, L, H. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, but not necessarily high-level privileges, then PR is Low (L). But I need to check if contributor-level access is considered Low or High. Since contributor is a lower privilege than administrator, maybe it's considered Low. So PR is L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). Stored XSS doesn't require user interaction. The script is executed when the user accesses the page, but the user doesn't need to do anything specific beyond visiting the page. However, the attacker might need the user to view the page. Wait, but UI in CVSS v3.1 is about whether user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. For stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact beyond accessing the page. However, the attack is triggered when the user views the page. But the UI metric is whether the attack requires user interaction. Since the user doesn't need to perform any action (like clicking a link) beyond accessing the page, which is a normal action, UI is None (N). Wait, but some sources say that stored XSS requires the user to view the page, which is considered as not requiring user interaction. So UI is N.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability is in the plugin, which is part of the WordPress application. The attack affects the same component (the web application), so the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component (like a database), it would be Changed (C). Here, it's within the same application scope, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability is XSS, which can lead to stealing session cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the site. So all three impacts are High (H). Because an attacker can read sensitive data (C:H), modify content (I:H), and potentially cause denial of service by injecting scripts that disrupt the site (A:H). However, for availability, XSS might not directly impact availability unless the script is designed to do so. But the CVSS guidelines for impact metrics consider that XSS can lead to data manipulation, which affects integrity, and data leakage affects confidentiality. Availability might be N if the attack doesn't directly impact the availability. Wait, but the description says the script is injected and executed when the user accesses the page. If the script is malicious, like a redirect or a script that consumes resources, it could affect availability. However, the default for XSS is usually C:H, I:H, A:N. But I need to check the exact impact. Since the vulnerability allows arbitrary script execution, which can lead to data exfiltration (C:H), data modification (I:H), but not necessarily availability. So A is N. Wait, but the original question says to determine the values for each base metric. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 impact metrics. The impact metrics are C, I, A. For XSS, the impact on confidentiality is high (since attacker can steal session cookies, etc.), integrity is high (since they can inject scripts to modify content), and availability is none (unless the script is designed to cause a DoS, which isn't mentioned here). So C:H, I:H, A:N. But the problem is that the original description doesn't mention availability impact. So I think A is N here.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low) - because the attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a privilege, but not high.\nUI: N (None) - no user interaction required beyond accessing the page.\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about PR. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access. In CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. The options are N, L, H. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, but not high-level privileges, then PR is Low. But contributor-level access in WordPress is a specific privilege. However, in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. But the options are N, L, H. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, but not high-level, then PR is Low. So PR is L.\n\nSo the vector string would be:\n\nAV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but the original answer example had A:H. But in this case, the availability impact is not mentioned. So A should be N. Let me confirm. The vulnerability is XSS, which typically doesn't affect availability unless the script is designed to do so. Since the description doesn't mention availability impact, A is N. So the final vector is:\n\nAV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nBut I need to check if the PR is correct. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. The options for PR are N, L, H. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. But in CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, but not high-level, then PR is Low. However, some sources might consider authenticated access as requiring Low privileges. So PR is L.\n\nAnother point: the UI metric. If the user needs to view the page, is that considered user interaction? The UI metric is whether the attack requires user interaction. For stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact beyond accessing the page. So UI is N. So that's correct.\n\nSo the final vector is:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to a memory leak when device registration fails. The fix involves calling put_device() to release a reference and freeing the name allocated in dev_set_name() via the kobject_cleanup() callback.\n\nSo, the vulnerability is a memory leak. Now, I need to map this to the CVSS metrics. Let's go through each metric one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel-level issue, it's likely exploitable remotely if there's a way to trigger the failure in device_register(). However, the description doesn't mention network access. But kernel vulnerabilities can often be exploited via local access, like through a local user or application. However, if the device_register() is called during system initialization or by a driver, maybe it's a local issue. But I'm not sure. Wait, the problem is that when device_register() fails, the memory isn't freed. But how would an attacker exploit this? A memory leak might not be directly exploitable unless it leads to a denial of service or other issues. But the CVSS metrics for AV: if the vulnerability can be exploited over the network, it's N. If it's local, then L. Since the kernel is part of the system, and the issue is in the device registration process, which might be triggered by a local user or a driver, maybe AV is Local (L). But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the device_register() is called by a user-space application, but that's less likely. Hmm. Maybe AV is Local (L) because it's a kernel-level issue that requires local access to exploit.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a memory leak. Exploiting a memory leak might require specific conditions. If the leak is not directly exploitable, maybe the AC is High (H). But if the leak can be exploited with minimal steps, maybe Low. However, since the vulnerability is a memory leak, which might not be directly exploitable for code execution, but could lead to a DoS. But the CVSS metrics for AC: if the attack requires complex steps, it's High. If it's straightforward, Low. Since the vulnerability is a memory leak, which might not be directly exploitable, but the AC might be considered Low if the attacker can trigger the failure in device_register() easily. But I'm not sure. Maybe AC is Low (L) because the attack is straightforward once the vulnerability is known.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): To exploit this, does the attacker need elevated privileges? Since it's a kernel vulnerability, typically, an attacker would need root or kernel-level privileges. However, if the memory leak can be exploited without such privileges, maybe PR is Low. But in most cases, kernel vulnerabilities require local privileges. So PR is probably High (H) if the attacker needs root access. Wait, but the vulnerability is a memory leak. If the leak is in a part of the kernel that's accessible to user-space, maybe the attacker can exploit it without needing root. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attacker would need to have some way to trigger the failure in device_register(), which might require local access. So PR could be High (H) if the attacker needs to have root or kernel privileges. But maybe it's Low if the attacker can trigger it from user space. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the kernel, so to exploit it, the attacker would need to have the ability to trigger the device_register() failure. If that's possible from user space, then PR might be Low. But if it's only possible with kernel privileges, then PR is High. Since the description doesn't specify, but the fix is in the kernel, I think PR is High (H) because the attacker would need to have the ability to interact with the kernel, which typically requires elevated privileges.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Does the attacker need user interaction? If the vulnerability is a memory leak that can be triggered automatically, then UI is None (N). If the attacker needs the user to perform an action, like opening a file, then UI is Required (R). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the device_register() failure might be triggered by a system event, not requiring user interaction, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel), so the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects a different component, like a separate service, then it would be Changed (C). Here, it's within the kernel, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability is a memory leak. If the memory leak doesn't expose sensitive data, then C is None (N). If the leak could lead to information disclosure, then C would be Low or High. But the description doesn't mention any data exposure. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, a memory leak might not directly affect data integrity. Unless the leak leads to data corruption, which isn't mentioned here. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): A memory leak can lead to a denial of service if the system runs out of memory. So if the leak is significant enough, it could cause the system to crash or become unresponsive. Therefore, A is High (H) because the vulnerability could lead to a DoS.\n\nWait, but the CVSS metrics for Availability: High (H) means the vulnerability can cause a complete loss of availability. If the memory leak is not severe enough, maybe it's Low. But the description says \"fix memory leak when register device fail\", which implies that the leak could accumulate over time, leading to resource exhaustion. So A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) because it's a kernel-level issue that requires local access.\nAC: Low (L) if the attack is straightforward, but maybe High (H) if it's complex. Wait, the attack complexity for a memory leak might be High because the attacker needs to trigger the specific failure condition. But I'm not sure. Let me check. The AC metric is about the complexity of the attack. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability with minimal effort, it's Low. If it requires complex steps, it's High. Since the vulnerability is a memory leak, which might not be directly exploitable, but the AC could be considered High. However, if the attacker can trigger the failure in device_register() easily, then AC is Low. This is a bit ambiguous. Maybe I should go with Low (L) as a default for kernel vulnerabilities unless specified otherwise.\n\nPR: High (H) because the attacker needs kernel privileges.\n\nUI: None (N) as no user interaction is required.\n\nS: Unchanged (U).\n\nC: None (N).\n\nI: None (N).\n\nA: High (H).\n\nSo the vector would be AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about AV. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, but the attack vector is local, then AV is Local (L). However, some kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger them via network. But the description doesn't mention that. So AV is Local (L).\n\nBut another thought: if the device_register() is called during the initialization of a device driver, which might be part of a system that's accessible via the network, but the vulnerability itself is a memory leak. However, without more context, it's safer to assume AV is Local (L).\n\nSo the final vector would be:\n\nAV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nBut I need to check if the availability is High. Since the memory leak could lead to a DoS, A is High. So that's correct.\n\nAnother check: the CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. The base score is calculated using the formula, but the user just wants the metrics, not the actual score. So the answer is the vector string.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.0999999999999996, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to extract sensitive data including reports detailing donors and donation amounts.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the GiveWP plugin for WordPress, allowing authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access to extract sensitive data like donor reports and donation amounts. \n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the attacker needs to be authenticated, but the vulnerability is in a function that's accessible via the plugin. Since WordPress plugins typically run on the web, and the attack doesn't require physical access or adjacent network, AV is likely Network (N). \n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The vulnerability is due to a misconfigured capability check. If the check is misconfigured, maybe the attacker just needs to have the right permissions (Subscriber-level) and doesn't need to perform complex steps. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is about the level of access needed. The attacker needs to be authenticated as a Subscriber or higher. Since Subscriber is a low-level role in WordPress, but the plugin might require that specific capability. However, the PR metric considers the level of privileges required. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated but not necessarily administrative privileges, but the capability check is misconfigured, maybe PR is Low (L). Wait, but the description says \"authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access and above\". So the attacker needs to have at least Subscriber access. In CVSS terms, if the attacker needs to have some level of access, but not high, then PR is Low. But if the attacker needs to have a specific privilege, maybe it's Low. Alternatively, if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing any specific privileges beyond authentication, then PR is None (N). Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated (i.e., have a user account with Subscriber access), then that's a requirement. But in CVSS, PR is categorized as None, Low, or High. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, but not necessarily with high privileges, then PR is Low. However, if the attacker doesn't need any privileges (like a guest), then PR is None. But in this case, the attacker must be authenticated, so PR is Low. Wait, but the PR metric in CVSS 3.1 considers the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to have a certain level of access (like Subscriber), but that's considered a low privilege, then PR is Low. So I think PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is whether the user needs to interact. The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing the user to perform an action, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). Since the plugin is part of WordPress, and the vulnerability is within the plugin itself, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed, but here it's within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. The vulnerability allows extraction of sensitive data (donor reports, donation amounts), which affects confidentiality. So C is High (H). There's no mention of integrity or availability issues, so I and A are None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Wait, but the PR might be None if the attacker doesn't need any privileges beyond authentication. Wait, the PR metric in CVSS 3.1 is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated (i.e., have a user account), that's considered a requirement. However, in CVSS, if the attacker needs to be authenticated but not with high privileges, then PR is Low. But if the attacker can exploit it without any authentication, PR is None. In this case, the attacker must be authenticated, so PR is Low. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS guidelines again. \n\nAccording to CVSS 3.1, PR is:\n- None (N): No privileges required. The vulnerability can be exploited without any access to the target.\n- Low (L): The attacker must have some level of access to the target, but not necessarily administrative or high-level privileges.\n- High (H): The attacker must have administrative or high-level privileges to exploit the vulnerability.\n\nIn this case, the attacker needs to be authenticated as a Subscriber, which is a low-level user in WordPress. So that's a requirement, but not high-level. Therefore, PR is Low (L). \n\nSo the final metrics are:\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nThe vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

This test can be packed into a helper, so such changes will be in the follow-up series after net is merged into net-next. if (ipv4_is_local_multicast(pmc->multiaddr) && !READ_ONCE(net->ipv4.sysctl_igmp_llm_reports))\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to a data race in the sysctl_igmp_llm_reports. The fix involves adding READ_ONCE() to prevent concurrent changes while reading the sysctl value. \n\nSo, the vulnerability is about a data race when accessing sysctl_igmp_llm_reports. Data races can lead to undefined behavior, but in this case, the issue is about concurrent access. However, the description doesn't mention any exploitation of this data race leading to a security issue like information disclosure, privilege escalation, or denial of service. It's more of a race condition that could potentially cause incorrect behavior, but the actual impact isn't specified.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel-level issue, it's likely that an attacker would need local access to exploit it. However, if the sysctl is accessible via a network interface or some other remote method, maybe AV could be Network. But the description doesn't mention remote exploitation. So I think AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The data race is a concurrency issue. Exploiting such a race might require specific conditions, like timing or specific system configurations. However, if the attacker has local access, maybe the complexity is low. But since it's a data race, the attacker might need to trigger the race condition, which could be considered low complexity. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and sysctl settings are typically accessible to the root or users with elevated privileges, the attacker would need high privileges. However, if the sysctl is set in a way that allows lower-privileged users to access it, maybe PR is Low. But the default is that sysctl settings are usually managed by the root. So PR is High (H)? Wait, but the vulnerability is in the kernel code. If an attacker can exploit this data race, they might not need high privileges. Wait, but the data race is in the kernel's handling of sysctl. If the sysctl is accessible via a system call that requires root, then the attacker would need high privileges. However, if the sysctl is a user-space configuration, maybe it's accessible to users. Hmm, this is a bit unclear. The description says \"sysctl_igmp_llm_reports\" which is a sysctl parameter. Sysctl parameters can be accessed by users with appropriate permissions. For example, some sysctls are only accessible by root. So if this one is, then PR would be High. But if it's a user-accessible sysctl, then maybe PR is Low. However, the vulnerability is in the kernel's handling of concurrent access. Exploiting this would require the attacker to have the ability to modify the sysctl while it's being read. If the attacker has local access, they might be able to do that. But the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have root or high privileges to modify the sysctl, then PR is High. If they can do it with lower privileges, then PR is Low. Since the sysctl is part of the kernel, I think it's likely that modifying it requires root privileges. Therefore, PR is High (H).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a data race that occurs during reading and writing of the sysctl. Exploiting this would require the attacker to have the ability to modify the sysctl while it's being read. This might not require user interaction, as it's a race condition that could be triggered by the attacker's process. However, if the attacker needs to interact with the system in a specific way, like triggering certain system calls, maybe UI is Required. But since the data race is inherent in the code, the attacker might not need user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component as the sysctl. So the scope is Unchanged (U), because the vulnerability doesn't affect a different component or scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The data race could lead to incorrect behavior, but the description doesn't mention any specific impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability. However, data races can lead to undefined behavior, which might allow an attacker to read or write memory in unexpected ways. If the data race allows an attacker to read or write memory that they shouldn't, that could impact confidentiality or integrity. But without more information, it's hard to say. However, the original fix is about preventing a data race, which might prevent a potential exploit. Since the CVE description doesn't mention any actual exploitation or impact, but the vulnerability is a data race that could be exploited, I need to consider the potential impact. \n\nIn CVSS, if the vulnerability could lead to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, or availability, then those metrics are set to High. If it's uncertain, maybe Low or None. However, data races can be exploited to cause denial of service (e.g., by causing the system to crash) or to leak information. But without explicit mention, it's safer to assume that the impact is not directly exploitable. However, the CVSS guidelines state that if the vulnerability could be exploited to cause a security impact, even if not explicitly stated, it should be considered. \n\nBut given that the vulnerability is a data race in the kernel, which is a critical component, the potential impact could be high. However, without knowing the exact exploit scenario, it's challenging. In the absence of specific information, I might have to default to None for all three. But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, if the data race could be exploited to cause a denial of service (e.g., by causing the system to crash), then Availability (A) could be High. However, the description doesn't mention that. \n\nAlternatively, since the vulnerability is a data race that could be exploited to read or write memory, which could lead to information disclosure (C) or integrity issues (I), but again, without explicit mention, it's hard to assign. \n\nIn the absence of specific information, the CVSS guidelines suggest that if the vulnerability could be exploited to cause a security impact, even if not explicitly stated, the metrics should be set accordingly. However, in this case, the vulnerability is a data race that might not directly lead to a security impact unless exploited in a specific way. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the impact metrics are None. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the data race could be exploited to cause a denial of service, then A would be High. But again, the description doesn't mention that. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. Maybe I should look for similar vulnerabilities. For example, data races in the kernel that could be exploited for privilege escalation or DoS. However, without explicit information, it's safer to assume that the impact is not directly exploitable, so C, I, A are None. But that might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the data race allows an attacker to read or write memory that they shouldn't, that could be a confidentiality or integrity issue. But again, without knowing the exact scenario, it's hard to say. \n\nIn the absence of clear information, I think the best approach is to set all impact metrics to None (N), as the vulnerability itself is a data race that doesn't directly lead to a security impact unless exploited in a specific way that isn't described here. Therefore, C, I, A are all N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 4.7, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's net/sched/sch_ets.c file. The issue is an out-of-bounds (OOB) indexing in the ets_class_from_arg() function when a clid of 0 is passed. This can lead to local privilege escalation.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a local privilege escalation, the attack would require local access to the system. So AV is Local (L). Wait, but sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger them via network. However, the description mentions that the overflow is triggered when passing a clid of 0, which might be through a system call or a local command. The log shows a PID 1275, which is a user process, and the error is from a user-space application (like a PoC). So the attack vector is local, not network. So AV is L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to an OOB index, which might be exploitable with low complexity. If the attacker can pass a specific clid value (like 0) to trigger the OOB, that's a low complexity. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability allows local privilege escalation. That means the attacker needs to have some level of access. But the description says \"local privilege escalation,\" which implies that the attacker is already a local user. However, in CVSS, if the attacker needs to have privileges to exploit the vulnerability, then PR is High. Wait, but if the vulnerability is in the kernel and can be exploited by a local user without needing elevated privileges, then PR is Low. Wait, the description says \"local privilege escalation,\" which suggests that the attacker is a regular user and can escalate to root. So the attacker needs to have user-level access, which is considered as requiring no privileges (since they are already a user). Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is a local user, they might need to have some privileges to execute the exploit. However, in this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit is via a system call or a user-space command. So the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges to trigger the vulnerability. Therefore, PR is None (N). Wait, but if the attacker is a regular user, they can exploit this to gain root. So the PR is None because the attacker doesn't need any privileges to exploit it. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is a local user, they might need to have some privileges to execute the exploit. However, in this case, the exploit is via a user-space application, so the attacker can run the exploit as a regular user. Therefore, PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered by passing a specific clid value. If the exploit requires the user to interact, like clicking a link or running a malicious program, then UI is Required (R). However, in this case, the attacker can exploit it by running a PoC program, which is a local action. So UI is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need user interaction beyond their own actions. Wait, but if the exploit requires the user to run a specific program, then UI is Required. However, the UI metric is about whether user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. If the attacker can exploit it without any user interaction (e.g., via a service or daemon), then UI is None. But in this case, the attacker would need to run the exploit code, which is a local action. So UI is None (N) because the user (attacker) is the one initiating the exploit. Wait, but the UI metric is about whether the user needs to interact with the system. If the exploit is automated, like a script, then UI is None. If it requires the user to click a link or something, then it's Required. Since the exploit is via a local program, UI is None.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component as the affected system. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects a different component (like a separate service), then it would be Changed. But here, it's within the same scope, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability allows local privilege escalation, which implies that the attacker can gain access to the system with higher privileges. This would allow them to access confidential data (C: High), modify data (I: High), and potentially disrupt services (A: High). However, the exact impact depends on the exploit. Since the vulnerability is a privilege escalation, the primary impact is on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. So all three are High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: H (High)\n\nNow, the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.6000000000000005, "success": true}

A SQL Injection vulnerability was identified in versions prior to 3.4.6 in the `idatendido_familiares` parameter of the `/html/funcionario/dependente_editarDoc.php` endpoint. This vulnerability allows attacker to manipulate SQL queries and access sensitive database information, such as table names and sensitive data. Version 3.4.6 fixes the issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a SQL Injection in the WeGIA web manager, specifically in the `idatendido_familiares` parameter of the `/html/funcionario/dependente_editarDoc.php` endpoint. The attack allows manipulation of SQL queries to access sensitive data like table names and data. The fix is in version 3.4.6.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in a web endpoint, so the attack can be done over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): SQL Injection typically requires crafting a specific payload, but it's not necessarily complex. Since the parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization, the attack might be straightforward. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any prior authentication. They can exploit this by sending a crafted request to the endpoint. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack doesn't require any user interaction. It's a direct exploit of the endpoint. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the web application) that's being attacked. So the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows access to sensitive database information, so Confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): Since the attacker can manipulate SQL queries, they might be able to alter data. However, the description mentions accessing data, not modifying it. But SQL Injection can sometimes lead to data modification. However, the description specifically says \"access sensitive database information,\" which is more about confidentiality. But maybe the integrity is also affected if the attacker can inject commands to alter data. Hmm, the description doesn't mention integrity impact, but the vulnerability allows manipulation of SQL queries. So maybe Integrity is High (H) as well. Wait, but the CVSS guidelines say that if the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data, then I is High. Since the attacker can manipulate SQL queries, they could potentially alter data, so I is High.\n\nAvailability (A): The description doesn't mention any impact on availability, like denial of service. So Availability is None (N).\n\nWait, but the problem says to determine each metric. Let me check again.\n\nThe vulnerability allows access to sensitive data (Confidentiality: H). The attack doesn't affect availability (A: N). For Integrity, since the attacker can inject SQL commands, they might be able to modify data, which would be a High impact. However, the CVE description doesn't explicitly mention data modification, only access. But SQL Injection can be used for both reading and writing. However, the description says \"access sensitive database information, such as table names and sensitive data.\" So maybe the primary impact is on confidentiality. But the CVSS guidelines for Integrity: if the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data, then I is High. If it's just reading, then maybe Low or None. But the presence of SQL Injection can allow both. However, the description doesn't specify that the attacker can modify data, only access. So maybe Integrity is Low or None. Wait, the CVSS 3.1 guidelines for Integrity: High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data, Low if it allows partial modification, and None otherwise. Since the description doesn't mention modification, but the vulnerability is SQL Injection which can be used for both, but the specific impact here is access. So maybe Integrity is Low? Or is it considered High because the potential exists? Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. But the CVE description says \"access sensitive database information,\" which is confidentiality. The integrity impact isn't mentioned. So maybe I is None? But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, since SQL Injection can be used to alter data, even if the specific instance here is about access, the potential for integrity impact exists. However, the CVSS calculation requires that the metric is based on the actual impact. Since the description doesn't mention integrity impact, maybe I is None. But I'm not sure. Let me check the CVSS guidelines again. The Integrity metric is High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data, then I is High. If it's just reading, then I is None. Since the description says \"access sensitive database information,\" which is reading, but the vulnerability is SQL Injection which can be used for both. However, the specific instance here is about access. So maybe I is None. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe the presence of SQL Injection implies that the attacker can inject commands to modify data, so I is High. This is a bit of a judgment call. Let me think again. The CVSS 3.1 base metrics for Integrity: High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data, then I is High. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data, then I is None. However, in some cases, the vulnerability might allow both. But the description here only mentions access to data, not modification. Therefore, I would say Integrity is None (N). Wait, but the CVSS guidelines might consider that SQL Injection can be used to modify data, so even if the specific instance is about access, the potential for integrity impact exists. However, the CVSS base score is based on the actual impact, not the potential. Since the description doesn't mention integrity impact, maybe I is None. Alternatively, maybe the presence of SQL Injection implies that the attacker can inject commands to modify data, so I is High. This is a bit tricky. Let me check an example. For example, if a vulnerability allows SQL injection that can be used to read data, then C is High, I is None, A is None. If the vulnerability allows both read and write, then C and I are High. But in this case, the description only mentions access to data. So I think I should go with I: None. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the CVSS guidelines consider that SQL Injection can be used to modify data, so I is High. Hmm. Let me check the CVSS 3.1 documentation. According to the CVSS 3.1 documentation, the Integrity (I) metric is High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data, then I is High. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data, then I is None. However, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to both read and modify data, then I is High. In this case, the vulnerability allows the attacker to manipulate SQL queries, which could be used to read or modify data. However, the CVE description specifically mentions accessing sensitive data, not modifying. Therefore, the primary impact is on confidentiality. However, the potential for integrity impact exists. But the CVSS base score is based on the actual impact, not the potential. Since the description doesn't mention integrity impact, I think I should set I to None. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the presence of SQL Injection implies that the attacker can inject commands to modify data, so I is High. This is a point where different people might have different interpretations. Given that the description doesn't mention integrity impact, I'll go with I: None. But I'm not sure. Let me check another angle. The CVSS 3.1 base score calculation for Integrity: if the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data, then I is High. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data, then I is None. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to partially modify data, then I is Low. In this case, the vulnerability allows the attacker to manipulate SQL queries, which could be used to read or modify data. However, the description only mentions access to data. Therefore, the primary impact is on confidentiality. So I would say I: None. But again, this is a judgment call. Alternatively, maybe the CVSS guidelines consider that SQL Injection can be used to modify data, so I is High. I think I need to make a decision here. Given that the description doesn't mention integrity impact, I'll go with I: None. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me proceed with that for now.\n\nSo, compiling all the metrics:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but if I is None, then the vector would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But that seems odd. Alternatively, if I is High, then it would be C:H/I:H/A:N. But the description doesn't mention integrity impact. Hmm. Let me check again. The vulnerability allows the attacker to manipulate SQL queries and access sensitive data. The ability to manipulate SQL queries could allow the attacker to inject commands that modify data. For example, they could inject a command to delete records or alter data. However, the description doesn't mention that. It only says they can access data. So maybe the integrity impact is not present. Therefore, I: None. But I'm still uncertain. Another way to think: if the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data, then C is High. If it allows the attacker to modify data, then I is High. If it allows both, then both C and I are High. Since the description doesn't mention modification, but the vulnerability is SQL Injection, which can be used for both, but the specific instance here is about access.", "prediction": "", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

This issue was fixed, but the fix was incomplete in that null-bytes were not counted against the input limit. Commit d1fbda62d3a47835d3fb35db8bd42ecc205a5386 contains an updated fix.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in Netty versions up to 4.1.118.Final. The issue is an unsafe reading of an environment file that could lead to a denial of service (DoS) when the application is on Windows. The problem arises when Netty tries to load a non-existent file, and if an attacker creates a large file, the application crashes. The fix was incomplete, allowing null-bytes to bypass the input limit.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is triggered by an attacker creating a large file. Since the attack doesn't require physical access or adjacent network, and it's possible over the network (if the application is exposed), but the description mentions it's on a Windows application. However, the attack vector isn't explicitly stated. But since it's a file that the application tries to load, maybe it's a local issue? Wait, but the attacker could create the file on the system where the application is running. However, if the application is running on a server, an attacker might need to have access to the system to create the file. But the description says \"when loaded on a Windows application,\" which might imply that the application is running on the Windows system, and the attacker could exploit it by creating the file there. However, if the application is running in a networked environment, maybe the attack vector is network. But the description doesn't specify that the attacker can trigger this remotely. It's a bit ambiguous. However, since the vulnerability is in the application's handling of a file, and the attacker needs to create the file on the system where the application is running, this might be a local attack. But if the application is accessible over the network, maybe the attacker can exploit it remotely. Hmm. The original CVE-2024-47535 was similar, and the fix was incomplete. But the current CVE is about the same issue. The original might have been a local issue. However, the current description says \"when loaded on a Windows application,\" which might imply that the application is running on the Windows system, and the attacker could exploit it by creating the file there. So maybe the attack vector is Local (L). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the application is running on a server and the attacker can access the file system, maybe it's a local attack. But if the attacker can send a request that causes the application to load a file, then it's a network attack. However, the description doesn't mention that. It just says the application attempts to load a file that doesn't exist. So maybe the attacker needs to have access to the system to create the file. Therefore, AV is Local (L). But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, if the application is running in a context where the attacker can influence the file path, maybe it's a network attack. But without more info, I'll go with Local (L) for AV.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The attack requires the attacker to create a large file. If the attacker can create such a file, the attack is straightforward. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have the ability to create the file on the system where the application is running. If the application is running with elevated privileges, maybe the attacker needs to have some access. But if the application is running as a normal user, the attacker might need to have access to the same user context. However, the description doesn't specify. But since the attack is about creating a file that the application tries to load, the attacker might need to have access to the file system where the application is running. So PR is Low (L) if the attacker can create the file without elevated privileges. But if the application is running with high privileges, maybe the attacker needs to have some privileges. However, the description doesn't mention that. So I think PR is Low (L) or None (N)? Wait, if the attacker can create the file without needing any special privileges, then PR is None (N). But if the attacker needs to have access to the system to create the file, then PR is Low (L). For example, if the application is running on a server, and the attacker can access the server's file system, then PR is Low. But if the attacker can exploit this remotely without needing to have access to the system, then PR would be different. But given the description, I think PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to create the file on the system, which might require some level of access, but not necessarily high privileges.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack requires the attacker to create the file. If the user is required to interact, like clicking a link or opening a file, then UI is Required (R). But in this case, the attacker creates the file, which might be done without user interaction. However, if the application is running in a context where the user has to open a file, then UI might be required. But the description doesn't mention user interaction. So UI is None (N) because the attack can be done without user interaction.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component that is being attacked. Since the application is the one that's being exploited, and the issue is within the application's own code, the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability leads to a denial of service, not data exposure. So confidentiality is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the attack doesn't affect data integrity. So Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The attack causes a denial of service, so Availability is High (H).\n\nWait, but the original issue is a DoS. So the availability impact is High. So A is H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure about AV. If the attack can be done remotely, then AV would be Network (N). But the description says \"when loaded on a Windows application,\" which might imply that the application is running on the Windows system, and the attacker needs to create the file on that system. So if the attacker can access the system, maybe it's a local attack. However, if the application is running in a networked environment and the attacker can send a request that causes the application to load a file, then AV would be Network. But the description doesn't specify that. It's a bit ambiguous. However, the original CVE-2024-47535 might have been a local issue. Given that, I think AV is Local (L). But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the attacker can exploit this remotely by sending a request that triggers the application to load a large file, then AV is Network. But the description doesn't mention that. It just says the application attempts to load a file that doesn't exist. So maybe the attacker has to create the file on the system where the application is running. Therefore, AV is Local (L).\n\nSo the final vector would be:\n\nAV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nBut let me check again. If the attack requires the attacker to have access to the system to create the file, then AV is Local. If the attacker can do it remotely, then Network. Since the description doesn't specify, but the original CVE-2024-47535 was a local issue, I think AV is Local.

This array is passed to usb_check_int_endpoints function from usb.c core driver, which executes a for loop that iterates over the elements of the passed array. Not finding a null element at the end of the array, it tries to read the next, non-existent element, crashing the kernel. To fix this, a 0 element was added at the end of the array to break the for loop. [1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=9c9179ac46169c56c1ad\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the vulnerability described in the CVE. The issue is a stack-out-of-bounds read in the hid-thrustmaster driver of the Linux kernel. The problem occurs because the usb_check_int_endpoints function iterates over an array without checking for a null terminator, leading to a crash when it tries to access beyond the array's bounds.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel driver, which is part of the system's core. Since it's a kernel module, an attacker would need to have some way to trigger this. However, the vulnerability is a stack overflow, which might be exploitable via a crafted input. But since the driver is part of the kernel, maybe it's accessible via user space. However, the original code is in the hid-thrustmaster driver, which is for USB devices. So, an attacker could potentially exploit this by using a malicious USB device. But wait, the vulnerability is a stack-out-of-bounds read, which might not be directly exploitable unless there's a way to control the data. However, the fix was adding a null terminator, which suggests that the input is from the USB device. So, the attack vector is probably Network (N) because USB devices can be connected over a network (like through a USB over IP setup), but more accurately, since it's a local device, maybe Adjacent (A) or Local (L). Wait, the kernel is part of the system, so if the vulnerability is in a driver that's part of the kernel, an attacker would need to have access to the system. But the stack overflow is in the kernel, which is a local issue. However, the original code is in the hid-thrustmaster driver, which is for USB devices. So, if an attacker can connect a malicious USB device, they could trigger this. But USB devices are typically local. So, the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker needs physical access to the device. Wait, but maybe the driver is part of the kernel, and the vulnerability is in the kernel code. However, the stack overflow is in the kernel, which would require local access. But if the attacker can send a crafted input via a USB device, which is a local attack. So AV is Local (L). Alternatively, if the USB device is connected over a network, but that's more of a stretch. So I think AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a stack-out-of-bounds read. To exploit this, the attacker would need to trigger the out-of-bounds read. However, the stack overflow might not be directly exploitable unless there's a way to control the data. But the vulnerability itself is a read, not a write. So, maybe the attack complexity is Low (L) because it's a simple buffer overflow that can be triggered with a crafted input. However, since it's a read, maybe it's harder to exploit. Wait, but the original issue is a crash, which is a denial of service. If the attacker can cause a crash, that's a DoS. But the CVSS metrics for confidentiality, integrity, and availability would depend on the impact. However, the AC here is about how complex the attack is. If the attacker can trigger the vulnerability with a simple input, then AC is Low. So I think AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so to exploit it, the attacker would need to have some privileges. However, if the driver is part of the kernel, and the vulnerability is in the driver, maybe the attacker needs to have local access. But the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already on the system, they might not need high privileges. However, if the vulnerability is in the kernel, maybe the attacker needs to have root access. Wait, but the vulnerability is a stack overflow in the kernel, which would require local access. So PR is probably None (N) if the attacker can exploit it without any privileges. Wait, no. If the attacker is on the system, they might have local privileges. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attacker can exploit it via a local input (like a USB device), then the attacker might not need any privileges. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without needing any user privileges, then PR is None (N). However, if the attacker needs to have some level of access, like being a local user, then PR might be Low (L). But in this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attacker can trigger it by connecting a malicious USB device. So, the attacker doesn't need any user privileges, just the ability to connect the device. Therefore, PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious USB device. The user would need to connect the device, which requires user interaction. So UI is Required (R). However, if the device is connected automatically, maybe not. But in general, connecting a USB device requires user action. So UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component as the driver. So the scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability doesn't affect a different component. If the vulnerability was in a different component, like a user-space application, then the scope would be Changed (C). But here, it's within the kernel, so S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability is a stack-out-of-bounds read. If the attacker can read arbitrary memory, that could lead to information disclosure. However, the original issue is a crash, but if the attacker can read memory, then C would be High (H). However, the description doesn't mention data leakage, just a crash. So maybe C is None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't directly impact confidentiality. But if the stack overflow allows reading memory, then it's a potential information leak. However, the fix was adding a null terminator, which suggests that the problem was a crash, not a data leak. So maybe C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability is a read, not a write. So it's unlikely to affect integrity. Therefore, I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability causes a crash, which is a denial of service. So A is High (H) because the system becomes unavailable.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: Required (R)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nWait, but earlier I thought AV was Local (L), but maybe I should reconsider. The attack vector is through a USB device, which is a local attack. So AV is Local (L). However, some might argue that if the USB device is connected over a network, but that's not standard. So AV is Local (L).\n\nBut wait, the CVSS v3.1 attack vector options are Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), Physical (P). Since the attack requires physical access to the device (plugging in a USB device), then AV is Physical (P)? Wait, no. Physical (P) is when the attacker has physical access to the system. But in this case, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability by connecting a USB device, which is a local attack. However, the attack vector is considered Local (L) if the attacker is on the same system. But if the attacker needs to have physical access to the system to plug in the device, then AV is Physical (P). Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The USB device is a local component, but the attack vector is through the device. So, if the attacker can connect the device, they have local access. But the attack vector is considered Local (L) if the attacker is on the same system. However, if the attacker needs to have physical access to the system to plug in the device, then AV is Physical (P). But in most cases, USB devices are considered local, so AV is Local (L). However, some sources might consider USB as Adjacent (A) if it's a local network, but that's not standard. I think the correct AV here is Local (L) because the attacker is on the same system. Alternatively, if the attacker needs to have physical access to the system, then AV is Physical (P). But the vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the system. So, the attacker doesn't need to have network access. Therefore, AV is Local (L).\n\nBut I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. According to CVSS guidelines, Attack Vector (AV) is:\n\n- Network (N): The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any prior access to the system, such as through a network.\n- Adjacent (A): The attacker must be on the same local network or have access to a local network segment.\n- Local (L): The attacker must have access to the system (e.g., via a local user account).\n- Physical (P): The attacker must have physical access to the system.\n\nIn this case, the attacker needs to connect a USB device, which requires physical access to the system. Therefore, AV is Physical (P). Wait, that makes sense. Because the attacker has to physically plug in the device. So AV is Physical (P). That's a key point I missed earlier.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the WEE! plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the 'wee' shortcode. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject scripts, which then execute when users access the affected pages.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in a WordPress plugin, and the attack requires the attacker to have contributor-level access, which is a user privilege, but the initial attack vector might be through the web. However, the exploit requires the attacker to be authenticated. Wait, but the attack vector is about how the attack is delivered. Stored XSS typically requires the attacker to inject the script into the application, which is done via a web request. So even though the attacker needs to be authenticated, the initial attack vector is through the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization. If the attacker can inject the script by exploiting the shortcode, which might be straightforward. Since it's a stored XSS, the attacker just needs to find a way to inject the script into the content, which might not require complex steps. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be authenticated as a contributor or higher. In WordPress, contributor access allows editing posts, which might be necessary to inject the shortcode. So the attacker needs some level of privilege, but not administrative. However, in CVSS, PR is categorized as None (N), Low (L), or High (H). Since the attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a user privilege, but not necessarily high. However, the CVSS PR metric considers the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a low privilege requirement. Wait, but the options are None, Low, High. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a low privilege requirement. So PR is Low (L)? Wait, but the description says \"authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above\". So the attacker needs to have some level of access, which is not None. So PR is Low (L) because it's not high, but not None. Wait, but the options are N, L, H. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a low privilege requirement. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Stored XSS doesn't require user interaction. The user doesn't need to do anything; the script is executed when they access the page. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component where the attack is initiated. Since the plugin is part of the WordPress application, and the attack is within the same application context, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The XSS can allow the attacker to steal session cookies or other sensitive data, leading to unauthorized access. So the impact on confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject scripts that alter the content or perform actions on behalf of the user, which affects the integrity of the data. So Integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The XSS might cause the application to crash or become unavailable, but in this case, the primary impact is on confidentiality and integrity. However, if the script is injected to cause a denial of service, but the description doesn't mention that. So Availability is None (N) unless there's a specific mention. Since the description doesn't mention availability impact, it's None (N).\n\nWait, but the CVSS v3.1 requires that if the vulnerability can affect any of the three (C, I, A), even if not explicitly mentioned, but in this case, the stored XSS is primarily about confidentiality and integrity. Availability isn't mentioned, so A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low) – because the attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a low privilege requirement.\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but earlier I thought PR might be N. Wait, the attacker needs to be authenticated. The PR metric in CVSS v3.1 is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a low privilege requirement. So PR is Low (L). But if the attacker doesn't need any privileges, it's N. However, in this case, the attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a user privilege. So PR is Low (L). Therefore, the correct values are as above.\n\nWait, but I need to check the CVSS v3.1 definitions again. The Privileges Required (PR) metric is defined as:\n\n- None (N): The attacker is not required to have any access to the target system.\n- Low (L): The attacker is required to have access to the target system, but the access is not elevated (e.g., a user account with limited privileges).\n- High (H): The attacker is required to have elevated access to the target system (e.g., administrative privileges).\n\nIn this case, the attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a user account with limited privileges. So PR is Low (L). Therefore, the correct value is PR:L.\n\nSo the final vector string is:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in an endpoint that's accessible over the network.

If an attacker can modify checklists, that could lead to data integrity issues. But does that affect availability? Probably not. So A remains None.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:H, A:N.\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N.

A malicious actor can leverage this vulnerability to cause a crash, read sensitive data, or execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in Autodesk Navisworks when parsing a maliciously crafted DWFX file, leading to an Out-of-Bounds Read. The possible outcomes are a crash, reading sensitive data, or executing arbitrary code in the current process context.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the vulnerability is triggered by a maliciously crafted file. Since the file can be sent over a network, like via email or a website, the attack vector is likely Network (N). If it required physical access or local interaction, it would be different, but here it's about parsing a file, which is typically network-based.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is an Out-of-Bounds Read, which might not require complex steps to exploit. If the attacker just needs to send a specially crafted file, the complexity is Low (L). High would be if it required specific conditions or multiple steps, but here it seems straightforward.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The description doesn't mention needing any user privileges. If the user opens the file, the application might be running with the user's privileges, but the vulnerability itself doesn't require elevated rights. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The user has to open the malicious file, which implies that user interaction is required. So UI is Required (R). If it was a remote exploit without user action, it would be None, but here the user must interact by opening the file.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability is in the application itself, so the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affected a different component or escalated privileges, it might be Changed, but here it's within the same process context.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability allows reading sensitive data, executing arbitrary code, or causing a crash. Reading data affects confidentiality (C: High), executing code affects integrity (I: High), and crashing the application affects availability (A: High).

It triggers a NULL pointer dereference in the periodic tick code. This happens because the legacy timer interrupt (IRQ0) is resent in software which happens in soft interrupt (tasklet) context. In this context get_irq_regs() returns NULL which leads to the NULL pointer dereference. The reason for the resend is a spurious APIC interrupt on the IRQ0 vector which is captured and leads to a resend when the legacy timer interrupt is enabled. This is wrong because the legacy PIC interrupts are level triggered and therefore should never be resent in software, but nothing ever sets the IRQ_LEVEL flag on those interrupts, so the core code does not know about their trigger type. Ensure that IRQ_LEVEL is set when the legacy PCI interrupts are set up.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to handling legacy PIC interrupts. The issue arises when a crash occurs, leading to a NULL pointer dereference in the periodic tick code. This happens because the legacy timer interrupt (IRQ0) is resent in a soft interrupt (tasklet) context, where get_irq_regs() returns NULL. The root cause is that the legacy PIC interrupts are level-triggered, but the IRQ_LEVEL flag isn't set, so the core code doesn't know their trigger type, leading to incorrect resending.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel-level issue, it can be exploited remotely if an attacker can trigger the crash. However, the description doesn't mention network access, but since it's a kernel vulnerability, it's possible that an attacker could exploit it via a local exploit or even remotely if there's a way to trigger the crash. However, the problem here is that the vulnerability is in the kernel's handling of interrupts, which might require specific conditions. But since the attack vector isn't explicitly stated, I need to infer. If the vulnerability can be triggered by a local user (like a local attacker with some privileges), then AV would be Local (L). But if it's possible to exploit it remotely, then Network (N). However, the description mentions that the crash-kernel fails to boot, which might be a local scenario. But I'm not sure. Wait, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so if an attacker can execute code that triggers the crash, maybe through a local exploit. But without more info, maybe AV is Local (L) because it's a kernel-level issue that might require local access. Alternatively, if the vulnerability can be triggered via a remote exploit, but the description doesn't mention that. Hmm. Maybe AV is Local (L) because it's a kernel-level issue that requires local access to exploit. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check again. The problem is that when a crash occurs, the subsequent crash-kernel fails to boot. So maybe the attacker needs to have the ability to trigger a crash, which could be done locally. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to a specific condition where the legacy timer interrupt is resent in a tasklet context. The attacker would need to trigger a crash, which might require specific steps. However, the complexity here is low because the vulnerability is a result of a specific code path that's triggered by a crash. If the attacker can cause a crash, then the vulnerability is exploited. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so an attacker would need high privileges to trigger the crash. However, if the crash is caused by a local user, maybe with root privileges. But the description doesn't specify. Wait, the problem is that when a crash occurs, the subsequent crash-kernel fails. So maybe the attacker needs to have the ability to cause a crash, which might require root or high privileges. Therefore, PR is High (H). But if the crash can be triggered by a local user without high privileges, then PR would be Low (L). However, in kernel vulnerabilities, often high privileges are required. So I think PR is High (H).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered by a crash, which might be caused by an attacker's actions. However, the description doesn't mention that user interaction is required. If the crash is caused by a local exploit, maybe no user interaction is needed. But if the attacker needs to interact with the system to trigger the crash, then UI would be Required (R). However, the problem here is that the crash is part of the system's behavior, so maybe UI is None (N). But I'm not sure. Let me think again. If the vulnerability is exploited by a local attacker who can cause a crash, then maybe no user interaction is needed. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel) that is being attacked. Since the issue is within the kernel, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects a different component, it would be Changed (C). Here, it's the same component, so S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability leads to a NULL pointer dereference, which could cause a crash, but does it impact confidentiality? The description doesn't mention data leakage or unauthorized access. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the vulnerability might cause a crash, but does it affect the integrity of the data? The problem is that the crash-kernel fails to boot, which might prevent the system from recovering properly, but not necessarily corrupt data. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability causes the crash-kernel to fail to boot about half the time, which affects the availability of the system. So A is High (H) because the system becomes unavailable when the crash occurs.\n\nWait, but the availability impact is High if the vulnerability can cause the system to crash or become unavailable. Since the crash-kernel fails to boot, which is a critical part of the system's recovery, this would definitely impact availability. So A is High (H).\n\nLet me check again:\n\nAV: Local (L) because the vulnerability is in the kernel and requires local access to exploit.\n\nAC: Low (L) because the attack is straightforward once the conditions are met.\n\nPR: High (H) because the attacker needs high privileges to trigger the crash.\n\nUI: None (N) because no user interaction is required beyond the initial crash.\n\nS: Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability is within the same component.\n\nC: None (N) because there's no confidentiality impact.\n\nI: None (N) because there's no integrity impact.\n\nA: High (H) because the system becomes unavailable when the crash occurs.\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about AV. If the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, then AV would be Network (N). However, the description doesn't mention remote exploitation. The problem is that the crash is part of the system's behavior, which might be triggered by a local user. So AV is Local (L). But if the attacker can cause a crash remotely, then AV would be Network. However, the description doesn't specify that. So I think AV is Local (L).\n\nAnother point: the vulnerability is in the kernel, which is a system component. If an attacker can exploit it, they might need local access. So AV is Local (L).\n\nSo the final vector string would be:\n\nAV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nBut let me check the CVSS v3.1 metrics again. For example, if the attack vector is Local, then AV is L. Attack complexity is Low because the steps to exploit are straightforward once the conditions are met. Privileges Required is High because the attacker needs high privileges to trigger the crash. User Interaction is None. Scope is Unchanged. Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are None, None, High respectively.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.0999999999999996, "success": true}

The server overrides the maximum size for websocket messages, allowing very large images to be tracked. This causes the server to become unresponsive to other requests while processing the large image, leading to a denial of service condition.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the aimhubio/aim version 3.25.0, specifically in the tracking server. The issue is that the server allows very large images to be tracked via WebSocket messages because it overrides the maximum size. This leads to a denial of service (DoS) as the server becomes unresponsive when processing these large images.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The description mentions that the server is vulnerable to a DoS attack. Since it's a WebSocket server, which typically operates over the network (like HTTP/WS), the attack vector is likely Network (N). Unless there's a specific mention of needing physical access or adjacent network, which there isn't here, so AV is N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability allows very large images to be sent. If the attacker just needs to send a large image without any specific steps, that's low complexity. The server's misconfiguration allows this, so the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The description doesn't mention that the attacker needs any specific privileges. Since it's a WebSocket server, an attacker can connect to it without authentication, so PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack doesn't require any user interaction. The attacker can send a large image directly to the server, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the server itself, and the impact is on the same component. Since the server is the one being attacked, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to another component, it would be Changed, but here it's the same server.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability leads to a DoS, which doesn't directly impact confidentiality. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the DoS doesn't affect data integrity. The server is just unresponsive, not corrupting data. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The main impact is a denial of service, so Availability is High (H). The server becomes unresponsive, which is a high impact on availability.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Wait, but the original problem says the answer should have the vector string. Let me check again. The user mentioned that the final line should be the vector string. But in the example, the answer had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, in the example given, the answer was C:H, I:H, A:H. But in our case, the vulnerability is a DoS, so A is H, but C and I are N. So the correct vector would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Let me confirm each metric again.\n\nYes, the attack vector is network, attack complexity low, no privileges needed, no user interaction, scope unchanged, confidentiality and integrity not affected, availability high.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary log files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Order Export & Order Import plugin for WooCommerce, allowing authenticated attackers with admin access to read arbitrary log files via the download_file() function. \n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the attacker needs to be authenticated, but the vulnerability is in a plugin that's part of WordPress. Since WordPress typically runs on a web server, and the attack is through the plugin's functionality, which is accessible over the network, AV is likely Network (N). Unless there's a local exploit, but the description doesn't mention that.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The vulnerability is a directory traversal, which usually requires specific input to exploit. However, if the attacker can craft a request to access arbitrary files, the complexity might be low. But since it's a specific function (download_file), maybe the attacker needs to know the exact path or parameters. However, directory traversal vulnerabilities are often considered low complexity because they can be exploited with a simple path manipulation. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs Administrator-level access. In CVSS, if the attacker needs high privileges, that's High (H). But wait, the description says \"authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above.\" So the attacker must have admin privileges. Therefore, PR is High (H). Wait, but in CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated as an admin, that's High. But sometimes, if the attack can be done without any privileges, it's None. But here, the attacker must have admin access, so PR is High (H).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description doesn't mention that user interaction is required. The attack is initiated by the attacker, so UI is None (N). Unless the attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a link, but the description doesn't say that. So UI is N.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability is in the plugin, which is part of the WordPress application. If the vulnerability affects the same component (the plugin), then the scope is Unchanged (U). If it's a different component, like a separate service, it might be Changed. But here, the plugin is part of the WordPress application, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A). The vulnerability allows reading arbitrary log files, which can contain sensitive information. So confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can access sensitive data. Integrity and Availability aren't mentioned. The attack is about reading files, not modifying or disrupting services. So I and A are None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:H, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Wait, but the PR was High because the attacker needs admin access. Let me check again. The PR metric in CVSS 3.1 is the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated as an admin, that's High. But sometimes, if the attack can be done with low privileges, it's Low. However, the description says \"Administrator-level access and above,\" which implies that the attacker must have high privileges. So PR is High (H). \n\nWait, but in some cases, if the attack requires the attacker to have a certain role, but the system allows that role to perform the action, maybe it's considered Low. But according to the CVSS guidelines, if the attacker needs to have privileges that are considered high (like admin), then PR is High.

Starting in version 14.0.0 and prior to versions 14.3.2 and 15.1.2, authenticated users are able to exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability when viewing certain localized backoffice components. Versions 14.3.2 and 15.1.2 contain a patch.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in Umbraco CMS, affecting versions before 14.3.2 and 15.1.2. The issue is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by authenticated users when viewing certain localized backoffice components.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that authenticated users can exploit it. Since it's a backoffice component, which is typically accessed via a web interface, the attack would be over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. XSS vulnerabilities often require low complexity to exploit, especially if it's a reflected or stored XSS. Since the user just needs to view certain components, it's likely low. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is about what the attacker needs. The user must be authenticated, but the description says \"authenticated users are able to exploit,\" which implies that the attacker already has some level of access. However, in CVSS, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered \"Low\" because it's not high privilege but not none. Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. But in the case of XSS, the attacker might not need any special privileges beyond being a regular user. However, the vulnerability is in the backoffice, which might require authentication. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated, which is a low privilege requirement. Wait, but the PR metric is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. However, in CVSS, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered \"Low\" because it's not high privilege. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is whether the user needs to interact. For XSS, the user might need to be tricked into clicking a link or visiting a malicious site. However, the description says \"when viewing certain localized backoffice components.\" If the attacker can inject the script into a component that the user views, then the user interaction might be required. But if the attacker can exploit it without user interaction, like through a stored XSS, then UI is None. However, the description doesn't specify if it's stored or reflected. But since it's a backoffice component, maybe it's stored. However, the user interaction might be required for the attack to occur. For example, the user has to view the component. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but in some cases, if the attacker can inject the script into a page that the user is forced to view, then UI might not be required. But the description says \"when viewing certain localized backoffice components,\" which implies that the user has to view them. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. Since the vulnerability is in the backoffice, which is part of the same application, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed. But here, it's within the same application, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. For XSS, the primary impact is on confidentiality and integrity. The attacker can steal session cookies (confidentiality) or inject malicious scripts (integrity). Availability might not be affected unless the XSS causes a denial of service, which isn't mentioned here. So C is High (H) because the attacker can access sensitive information. I is High (H) because the attacker can modify data or execute scripts. A is None (N) because there's no mention of availability impact.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low) – because authenticated users need to be logged in, which is a low privilege requirement.\nUI: R (Required) – the user has to view the component.\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but earlier I thought PR might be N. Let me double-check. The PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. In CVSS, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered \"Low\" because it's not high privilege. So PR is Low (L). But some might argue that if the attacker is already authenticated, maybe it's considered \"None\" because the user is authenticated. Wait, no. The PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. For example, if the vulnerability is in a part of the system that requires authentication, then the attacker must have that privilege. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated, which is a low privilege requirement. However, if the attacker doesn't need any privileges, it's N. But in this case, the attacker must be authenticated, so PR is L.\n\nWait, but according to the CVSS guidelines, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered \"Low\" because it's not high privilege. So PR is L.

Since the attack doesn't require physical access or adjacent network access, AV is likely Network (N). The attacker can exploit this remotely over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The description says it's a missing bounds check. If the attacker needs to craft a specific payload to exploit this, but the complexity is low because it's a straightforward buffer overflow or similar issue. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability allows local escalation of privilege if the attacker already has System privilege. Wait, that's a bit confusing. The description says \"if a malicious actor has already obtained the System privilege.\" So the attacker needs to have System privileges to exploit this. But that seems like the attacker already has high privileges. However, the vulnerability itself might be a way to escalate from lower privileges to higher. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read: \"could lead to local escalation of privilege if a malicious actor has already obtained the System privilege.\" Hmm, that might mean that the attacker needs to have System privilege to exploit it, which would imply that the PR is High (H). But that doesn't make sense because if you need System privilege to exploit it, then the vulnerability isn't a privilege escalation but rather a way to do something else with existing high privileges. Alternatively, maybe the vulnerability allows escalation from lower to higher privileges. Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me think again. The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write. If the attacker has System privilege, they can exploit this to escalate further? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the correct interpretation is that the vulnerability allows escalation of privilege, but the attacker needs to have some initial access. Wait, the original description says \"local escalation of privilege if a malicious actor has already obtained the System privilege.\" That seems like the attacker already has System privilege, so the vulnerability is being used to escalate further. But that's not typical. Usually, privilege escalation vulnerabilities allow an attacker with lower privileges to gain higher ones. Maybe the wording is that the vulnerability could lead to local escalation of privilege, but the attacker needs to have System privilege to exploit it. That would mean that the PR is High (H), because the attacker needs to have System privileges to exploit the vulnerability. But that seems counterintuitive. Alternatively, maybe the attacker can exploit this vulnerability to escalate from, say, user to System. But the description says \"if a malicious actor has already obtained the System privilege,\" which might mean that the attacker already has System privilege, and the vulnerability allows them to do something else. That's confusing. Maybe the correct approach is to look at the Privileges Required metric. If the attacker needs to have System privileges to exploit the vulnerability, then PR is High. But if the vulnerability allows escalation from lower to higher, then PR would be Low or None. However, the description says \"local escalation of privilege if a malicious actor has already obtained the System privilege.\" That phrasing suggests that the attacker already has System privilege, so the PR is High. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the vulnerability is a way to escalate from lower to higher, but the attacker needs to have some initial access. Wait, the user interaction is not needed, so maybe the attacker can exploit it without user interaction. But the PR would be the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have System privileges to exploit it, then PR is High. But if the vulnerability allows escalation from lower to higher, then PR is Low. However, the description is a bit unclear. Let me check the original CVE description again: \"could lead to local escalation of privilege if a malicious actor has already obtained the System privilege.\" So the escalation is from System to something else? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the correct interpretation is that the vulnerability allows escalation of privilege, but the attacker needs to have System privilege to exploit it. That would mean that the PR is High. But that seems like the attacker already has high privileges, so the vulnerability isn't a privilege escalation but something else. Alternatively, maybe the wording is that the vulnerability could lead to escalation of privilege, but the attacker needs to have System privilege to exploit it. That would imply that the PR is High. However, in standard CVSS terms, if the attacker needs to have high privileges to exploit the vulnerability, then PR is High. But if the vulnerability allows escalation from lower to higher, then PR is Low. Since the description is a bit ambiguous, but the key point is that the attacker needs to have System privilege to exploit it, which would be High. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider that the vulnerability is a local issue, so the attacker is already on the system. So the PR would be None (N) if no privileges are needed, but if the attacker needs to have some privileges, like user-level, then it's Low. However, the description says \"local escalation of privilege if a malicious actor has already obtained the System privilege.\" That suggests that the attacker already has System privilege, so the PR is High. But that seems like the attacker already has the highest privilege, so the vulnerability isn't a privilege escalation. This is confusing. Maybe the correct approach is to look at the standard for similar vulnerabilities. For example, if a vulnerability allows escalation from user to admin, then PR is Low. If it requires admin to exploit, then PR is High. But in this case, the description says that the attacker has already obtained System privilege, so the PR is High. But that seems counterintuitive. Alternatively, maybe the vulnerability is a way to escalate from lower to higher, but the attacker needs to have some initial access. However, the description doesn't mention that. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with PR as High (H) because the attacker needs to have System privilege to exploit it. But I'm not entirely confident here.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is stated as not needed, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) if the vulnerability affects the same component that's being attacked. Since it's a local escalation, the scope is unchanged. If the vulnerability affects a different component, it would be Changed (C). But since it's a local escalation, the scope is Unchanged.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are all High (H) because the vulnerability allows escalation of privilege, which can lead to unauthorized access to data (confidentiality), modification of data (integrity), and disruption of services (availability). However, the description doesn't explicitly mention all three. The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, which would impact all three. So C, I, A are all High.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Network (N) because it's a network service.\nAC: Low (L) because the attack is straightforward.\nPR: High (H) because the attacker needs System privilege.\nUI: None (N) as stated.\nS: Unchanged (U) because it's a local escalation.\nC: High (H)\nI: High (H)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. But wait, earlier I thought PR might be High, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me re-examine the PR. If the attacker needs to have System privilege to exploit the vulnerability, then PR is High. However, if the vulnerability allows escalation from lower to higher, then PR is Low. The description says \"local escalation of privilege if a malicious actor has already obtained the System privilege.\" That phrasing suggests that the attacker already has System privilege, so the PR is High. But that seems like the attacker already has the highest privilege, so the vulnerability isn't a privilege escalation. Maybe the correct interpretation is that the vulnerability allows escalation from lower to higher, but the attacker needs to have some initial access. However, the description doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the vulnerability is a way to escalate from user to System, but the attacker needs to have user privileges. In that case, PR would be Low. But the description says \"if a malicious actor has already obtained the System privilege,\" which implies that the attacker already has System privilege. That's confusing. Maybe the correct answer is PR: None (N) if the attacker doesn't need any privileges, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if the attacker needs to have some privileges to exploit it, but the description says they have System privilege. I think I need to make a judgment call here. Given that the vulnerability is in scp, which is a system-level tool, and the attack requires System privilege, I'll go with PR: High (H). But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing any privileges, then PR is None. If they need low, like user, then Low. If they need high, like admin, then High. The description says the attacker has already obtained System privilege, which is high. So the PR is High. Therefore, the vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.5999999999999996, "success": true}

Add a null point check to avoid the Kernel Oops.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. The CVE is about a NULL pointer dereference in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth driver when an unsupported USB dongle is inserted. \n\nFirst, I need to determine each metric. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is triggered by inserting a USB dongle, which is a network-connected device. But wait, USB is usually considered adjacent (A) because it's a local connection, not over a network. However, sometimes network is used for remote access. Hmm, but inserting a USB dongle is a local action. So maybe AV is Adjacent (A)? Or is it Local (L)? Wait, the attack vector is how the attacker reaches the vulnerable component. If the attacker can insert a USB device, that's a local action, so AV would be Local (L). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. The CVSS guide says Network (N) is for remote access, Adjacent (A) is for local network, but USB is a physical connection. Wait, no, USB is a local interface. So maybe AV is Local (L)? Or is it Physical (P)? No, because the attacker doesn't need physical access to the system; they just plug in the device. Wait, but the system is already in their possession. So maybe AV is Local (L) because the attack is initiated through a local interface. Alternatively, if the system is not under the attacker's control, but the attacker can insert a device, that's a physical attack. But the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker would need to have access to the system to plug in the device. So AV is Local (L) or Physical (P)? I think Physical (P) is when the attacker has physical access to the device. But in this case, the attacker is inserting the USB dongle, which is a local action. Wait, the CVSS definition for AV: Network (N) is when the attack can be launched remotely, Adjacent (A) is when the attacker is on the same network, Local (L) is when the attacker has access to the system (like through a local interface), and Physical (P) is when the attacker has physical access to the device. Since the attacker needs to insert the USB dongle, which is a local action, but not necessarily physical access. Wait, but inserting a USB device is a physical action. So maybe AV is Physical (P)? But that might not be right. Let me think again. If the system is already in the attacker's hands, like they have physical access, then AV is P. But if the attacker can exploit this remotely, then it's N. However, in this case, the attacker needs to insert a USB device, which requires physical access. So AV is Physical (P). But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct AV is Local (L) because the attack is through a local interface. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me check some examples. For example, a vulnerability that requires a local user to trigger it would have AV:Local. If it's a USB device, which is a local interface, then AV is Local (L). So I'll go with AV:Local (L).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. The attacker needs to insert a specific USB dongle that's not in the ic_id_table. The attack requires the attacker to have a specific device, but the complexity is low because it's a simple action. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to have the ability to insert a USB device. If the system is already compromised, maybe the attacker has privileges. But in this case, the vulnerability is triggered by inserting a device, which doesn't require any user privileges. So PR is None (N), because the attacker doesn't need any privileges to exploit it. Wait, but inserting a USB device might require user interaction. Wait, the user has to plug in the device. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can insert the device without needing any user privileges, then PR is None. But if the attacker needs to have user privileges to insert the device, then PR would be Low or High. However, in a typical scenario, inserting a USB device is a user action, but the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the attacker doesn't need any privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The user has to insert the USB device, so user interaction is required. Therefore, UI is Required (R). Wait, but the user interaction is part of the attack. If the user has to plug in the device, then UI is Required. However, if the attack can be triggered without user interaction, like through a network, then UI is None. In this case, the user must insert the device, so UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on the kernel itself. Since the vulnerability is in the same component (the kernel), the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects a different component, like a user-space application, then it would be Changed (C). Here, it's within the kernel, so S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A). The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which can cause a kernel panic (Oops), leading to a denial of service. So Availability is High (H). Confidentiality and Integrity might not be impacted unless the attacker can exploit it to leak data or modify data. Since the vulnerability is a crash, it's more about availability. So C:None, I:None, A:High.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: Required (R)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nWait, but earlier I was confused about AV. If AV is Local (L), then the vector would be AV:L. But some sources might consider USB as Adjacent (A) or Local. Let me check again. According to CVSS, Attack Vector (AV) is the network location from which the attack is launched. For example, if the attack can be launched remotely over the network, AV is N. If it's on the same network (like a local network), AV is A. If it's on the same system (local), AV is L. If it's physical access, AV is P. In this case, inserting a USB device is a local action, so AV is Local (L). However, some might argue that USB is a physical interface, so AV is P. But I think the correct answer here is AV:Local (L) because the attack is initiated through a local interface (USB), not requiring network access. So I'll stick with AV:L.\n\nSo the final vector would be:\n\nAV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nBut wait, the UI is Required (R) because the user has to insert the device. So the vector is:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nBut I need to confirm each metric again. Let me go through each one once more.\n\nAV: Local (L) – because the attack is via a local USB interface.\nAC: Low (L) – the attack is simple, just inserting a device.\nPR: None (N) – no privileges needed, the user can just plug in the device.\nUI: Required (R) – the user must interact by inserting the device.\nS: Unchanged (U) – the vulnerability is in the kernel, same component.\nC: None (N) – no confidentiality impact.\nI: None (N) – no integrity impact.\nA: High (H) – the crash leads to denial of service.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

Add a NULL check for test_state.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. The CVE is about a null dereference in the Linux kernel's KUnit test function. The vulnerability arises when kunit_kzalloc() returns a NULL pointer, which is then dereferenced without a check, leading to a crash.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each metric. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system, and the issue is in a test function, I'm not sure if it's exploitable from outside. But wait, KUnit is a testing framework for the Linux kernel, so maybe this is an internal issue. However, if the test is run as part of the kernel build process, maybe it's not accessible from the network. But if someone can trigger the test in a way that's part of the kernel's execution, maybe it's local. But I think the attack vector here is Local (L) because the vulnerability is in the kernel code, and exploitation would require local access to the system, like a local attacker with the ability to run the test or manipulate the kernel's execution flow. Alternatively, if the test is part of a module that's loaded, maybe it's adjacent? Hmm, but adjacent usually refers to same network segment. I think AV is Local (L) here.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a null dereference. To exploit it, the attacker would need to trigger the allocation of a NULL pointer. If the test is run in a controlled environment, maybe the attacker can cause the allocation to fail. But is that considered low or high complexity? Since it's a straightforward condition (allocation failure), maybe AC is Low (L). Because the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps, just cause the allocation to fail, which might be possible through specific inputs or conditions.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so exploiting it would require kernel-level privileges. However, if the test is run as part of the kernel's own testing, maybe the attacker needs to have the ability to run the test, which might require root access. So PR is High (H)? Wait, but if the test is part of the kernel's internal process, maybe the attacker doesn't need any privileges. Wait, but the kernel is running with high privileges. If the vulnerability is in a test that's part of the kernel's build or testing, maybe the attacker would need to have access to the system to trigger the test. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the test is part of a module that's loaded, maybe the attacker needs to have some privileges. But since the vulnerability is in the kernel code, perhaps the attacker needs to have kernel privileges to exploit it. So PR is High (H). But wait, if the test is run during the build process, maybe it's not exploitable by an external attacker. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe the PR is None (N) if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that's not accessible to users. But I think the correct approach here is that since the vulnerability is in the kernel, which requires high privileges to exploit, PR is High (H). But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If the vulnerability is in a function that's called during normal kernel operations, then an attacker would need to have the ability to trigger that function, which might require kernel privileges. So PR is High (H).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a null dereference that occurs during the test. If the test is run automatically, maybe no user interaction is required. But if the test is part of a user-initiated process, then UI might be Required (R). However, since the test is part of the kernel's internal testing, it's likely that the test is run without user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component. So the scope is Unchanged (U). Because the vulnerability doesn't affect a different component or scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability is a null dereference, which would cause a crash (availability impact). However, does it affect confidentiality or integrity? A null dereference typically leads to a crash, which is an availability issue. So C and I would be None (N), and A would be High (H) because the system could be made unavailable. Wait, but the impact is high if the system crashes. So A is High (H). C and I are None because the vulnerability doesn't leak data or modify data, just cause a crash.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) – because the vulnerability is in the kernel, which requires local access to exploit.\nAC: Low (L) – the attack is straightforward once the allocation fails.\nPR: High (H) – requires kernel-level privileges to exploit.\nUI: None (N) – no user interaction needed.\nS: Unchanged (U) – same component.\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Wait, but I'm not sure about AV. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, but the test is part of the kernel's own testing, maybe the attack vector is Local. But if the test is part of a module that's loaded, maybe it's Adjacent? Or maybe the attack vector is Network? No, that doesn't make sense. I think AV is Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the system to trigger the test. So the final vector is AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But I need to check if the attack vector is correct. Alternatively, if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that's accessible via a system call or something, maybe AV is Network. But I don't think that's the case here. The test is part of the kernel's internal testing, so it's not exposed to external attacks. Therefore, AV is Local (L).\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.0999999999999996, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to a memory leak in the watch_queue. The commit mentioned fixed the bitmap but not the page array, leading to an unreferenced object memory leak.\n\nSo, the main issue here is a memory leak. Now, I need to map this to the CVSS metrics. Let's go through each metric one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a memory leak, it might be exploitable via a local process. However, the description doesn't mention if it's exploitable over the network. But wait, the backtrace includes functions like pipe_ioctl and vfs_ioctl, which are part of the system call handling. If an attacker can trigger this via a system call, that would be a local exploit. So AV is likely Local (L). But wait, maybe it's possible to exploit it remotely if there's a way to trigger the system call from a user-space application. However, without more info, I think it's safer to assume it's a local issue. But I need to check if the vulnerability can be exploited without local access. Since the memory leak is in the kernel, but the exploit would require some way to trigger the issue, which might be through a local process. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a memory leak. Exploiting a memory leak typically requires some level of complexity, like crafting a specific input to trigger the leak. However, if the leak is in a system call that's commonly used, maybe it's easier. But since the description doesn't mention any specific exploit steps, I might lean towards High (H) because it's not a straightforward exploit. But wait, memory leaks might not be directly exploitable unless they lead to other issues like use-after-free or arbitrary memory access. If the leak itself isn't directly exploitable, maybe the AC is High. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the vulnerability is a simple memory leak that doesn't require complex steps to exploit, maybe AC is Low. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think again. The vulnerability is a memory leak, but the CVSS metrics for confidentiality, integrity, and availability might be affected. However, the base score calculation for AC is about the complexity of the attack. If the attacker needs to perform a specific action (like sending a crafted input to a system call), that's Low. But if it's more complex, like needing to bypass protections, it's High. Since the description doesn't specify, but the issue is in the kernel, maybe it's considered Low. Wait, but the CVSS guidelines for AC: Low if the attack requires no additional information or is trivial, High if it requires specific conditions. Since the memory leak is a result of the code not freeing the page array, maybe the exploit would require triggering the code path that leads to the leak, which might be Low. But I'm not certain. Maybe I should go with Low here.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, an attacker would need to have some level of privileges. However, if the memory leak is in a system call that's accessible to unprivileged users, then PR could be None (N). For example, if a user can trigger the system call (like pipe_ioctl) without needing elevated privileges, then PR is None. The backtrace shows that the process is \"syz-executor335\", which is a test process, but in general, if the system call is accessible to regular users, then PR is None. So I think PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a memory leak. Exploiting it might not require user interaction. If the attacker can trigger the issue through a system call without needing the user to do anything, then UI is None (N). So UI is None.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component as the affected system. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects a different component, it would be Changed, but here it's within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability is a memory leak. A memory leak doesn't directly impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability. However, if the leak leads to resource exhaustion (like a denial of service), then Availability might be High. But the description doesn't mention any impact on availability. The memory leak itself might not directly affect confidentiality or integrity unless it's part of a larger exploit. However, the CVSS metrics for C, I, A are based on the potential impact. Since the vulnerability is a memory leak, which is a resource management issue, but without further exploitation, the impact might be None. However, in some cases, a memory leak could be considered as a low impact on availability if it leads to system instability over time. But the CVSS guidelines state that if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a denial of service, then A is High. If the leak is not directly exploitable for DoS, then A is None. Similarly, for confidentiality and integrity, if the leak doesn't expose data or allow modification, then C and I are None. However, the CVSS base score calculation for these metrics is based on the potential impact. If the vulnerability is a memory leak that doesn't directly allow data exposure or modification, then C, I, A are None. But I need to check the CVSS guidelines again. The CVSS 3.1 base metrics for impact are based on the potential for the vulnerability to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. If the vulnerability is a memory leak that doesn't directly allow unauthorized access, modification, or denial of service, then the impact metrics are None. However, if the memory leak could be exploited to cause a DoS (e.g., by exhausting memory), then A would be High. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think C, I, A are all None. Wait, but the CVSS impact score calculation might require at least one of them to be High or Low. However, the base score calculation for the impact is based on the maximum of the three. If none are affected, then the impact is 0. But the base score is calculated using the formula. However, the user is asking for the values of C, I, A. So if the vulnerability doesn't impact any of them, then they are None. But I need to be careful here. The memory leak itself might not directly impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability. However, if the leak is part of a larger vulnerability that could be exploited, but the description doesn't mention that. So I think C, I, A are all None.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) because the vulnerability is in the kernel and requires local access to exploit.\nAC: High (H) because exploiting a memory leak might require specific conditions.\nPR: None (N) because the system call is accessible to unprivileged users.\nUI: None (N) because no user interaction is required.\nS: Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability is within the same component.\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: None (N)\n\nWait, but if the memory leak could lead to a denial of service (e.g., if the system runs out of memory), then A might be High. However, the description doesn't mention that. The CVE description only mentions a memory leak, not a DoS. So without explicit mention of availability impact, A is None. Similarly, confidentiality and integrity are not impacted. So the values are as above.\n\nNow, the CVSS vector string would be:\n\nAV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N\n\nBut wait, the base score calculation would then be based on these metrics. However, the user is asking for the vector string, not the score.

Prior to version 5.1.15, an incorrect input validation could allow an authenticated user to read sensitive information, including login token or other content stored in the database. This could lead to privilege escalation if cookies are enabled (default setting). Users must upgrade to eLabFTW version 5.1.15 to receive a fix. No known workarounds are available.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in eLabFTW before version 5.1.15. The issue is an incorrect input validation that allows an authenticated user to read sensitive information like login tokens or other database content. This could lead to privilege escalation if cookies are enabled, which is the default. The fix is to upgrade to 5.1.15, and there are no workarounds.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The description mentions that the vulnerability allows an authenticated user to read sensitive information. Since the user is authenticated, this might be a local or adjacent attack. However, the input validation is likely part of the web application, so if the user is authenticated via the web, the attack vector could be network-based. Wait, but authenticated users might be accessing the system through the network. So AV is Network (N) because the attack can be initiated remotely over the network, but the user needs to be authenticated. However, the CVSS AV metric considers whether the attack can be performed remotely. Since the user is authenticated, but the initial access is via the network, I think AV is Network (N). Because even though authentication is required, the attack vector is still network-based.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation. If the input validation is not properly handled, an attacker might exploit it with low complexity. For example, sending a crafted request that bypasses validation. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user needs to be authenticated to exploit this. The description says \"an authenticated user,\" so PR is Low (L) or High (H)? Wait, in CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the user is already authenticated, then the attacker needs to have the same privileges as the authenticated user. But the vulnerability allows the user to read sensitive information, which might be part of their existing privileges. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since the user is authenticated, but the attack is against the system, maybe PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated, but that's a low privilege requirement. Wait, but in CVSS, PR is categorized as None (N), Low (L), or High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a low privilege requirement. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but if the user is already authenticated, maybe the PR is None? No, because the user has to be authenticated to perform the action. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have a low level of privileges (i.e., being authenticated) to exploit the vulnerability.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says that the vulnerability could lead to privilege escalation if cookies are enabled (default setting). Since cookies are enabled by default, the user interaction is not required. The attack can be done without any user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component that is being attacked. Since the user is authenticated and the data is read from the database, the scope is unchanged. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows reading sensitive information, so confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can access confidential data.\n\nIntegrity (I): The description doesn't mention any impact on data integrity. The vulnerability is about reading data, not modifying it. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): Similarly, there's no mention of availability impact. The vulnerability is about reading data, not causing a denial of service. So A is None (N).\n\nWait, but the description says that this could lead to privilege escalation. Privilege escalation would affect confidentiality, integrity, or availability. But the main impact here is confidentiality (reading sensitive info). Privilege escalation might allow the attacker to perform actions they shouldn't, which could affect other metrics. However, the CVSS base score is based on the impact of the vulnerability. The primary impact here is confidentiality. The privilege escalation is a possible consequence, but the base metrics are based on the direct impact. So for the base score, C is High (H), I and A are None (N).\n\nWait, but the CVSS v3.1 base score considers the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. If the vulnerability allows reading sensitive data, that's a confidentiality impact. If the privilege escalation allows modifying data, that would be integrity. But the description doesn't mention that. It just says \"could lead to privilege escalation if cookies are enabled.\" So the main impact is confidentiality. Therefore, C is High (H), I and A are None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought PR might be Low (L) because the user needs to be authenticated. But in some cases, if the user is already authenticated, maybe PR is None? Let me check the CVSS definitions again.\n\nPR: None (N) means no privileges are required. Low (L) means the attacker needs to have the same privileges as a normal user. High (H) means the attacker needs administrative privileges.\n\nIn this case, the attacker is an authenticated user, which is a normal user. So PR is Low (L). Because the attacker needs to be authenticated (i.e., have user privileges) to exploit the vulnerability. So PR is Low (L).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 2.3000000000000007, "success": true}

This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. The CVE is about a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IBM Jazz Foundation versions. The description says it allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript in the Web UI, altering functionality and possibly leading to credentials disclosure in a trusted session.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each metric. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). Since it's a web-based vulnerability and the attack is through the web UI, the attack vector is likely Network (N). That makes sense because the attacker doesn't need to be physically present or adjacent; they can exploit it over the network.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). XSS vulnerabilities often require low complexity. The attacker just needs to inject malicious script, which is usually straightforward. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The description says \"users\" can exploit this. If the user is already authenticated, maybe they need some privileges. But wait, the vulnerability allows embedding JavaScript in the Web UI. If it's a reflected or stored XSS, maybe the attacker doesn't need any privileges. However, if it's a DOM-based XSS, maybe the user needs to be authenticated. The description mentions \"within a trusted session,\" which implies the user is already authenticated. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can inject the script without needing any special privileges beyond being a regular user, then PR is None (N). But if the user needs to be authenticated, that might be considered as requiring some privileges. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. However, in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges the attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without needing any special privileges (like a regular user), then PR is None. But if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that might be considered as requiring some privileges. However, in many cases, XSS vulnerabilities don't require elevated privileges, just being a user. So I think PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says the user can embed the script, but does the attack require user interaction? For example, if it's a reflected XSS, the user might need to click on a link. If it's stored XSS, maybe the user doesn't need to interact. However, the description says \"users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI\", which might imply that the user (the attacker) is the one embedding it. Wait, maybe the user here refers to the victim. Wait, the vulnerability allows users (the attackers) to embed code, which would require the victim to interact with the malicious script. For example, if the attacker sends a link to the victim, the victim clicks it, and the script runs. In that case, user interaction is required. So UI would be Required (R). But if the vulnerability is stored, like in a comment or form, then the user (victim) might not need to interact. However, the description says \"altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.\" That sounds like the attacker can inject the script into the UI, and when the victim views it, the script runs. So the victim's interaction is required. Therefore, UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component (the web UI) that the user is interacting with. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability was in a different component, like a server that's part of a different scope, it would be Changed. But here, it's within the same application, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability allows credentials disclosure, which affects confidentiality (C: High). Altering functionality affects integrity (I: High). However, the description doesn't mention availability issues, so A is None. Wait, but the problem says \"altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure\". So both confidentiality and integrity are impacted. So C and I are High. Availability isn't mentioned, so A is None.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but earlier I thought UI might be R. Let me double-check. If the attack requires the user (victim) to interact, like clicking a link, then UI is Required. So yes, UI:R. But some sources might say that for XSS, UI is None if it's stored, but if it's reflected, it's Required. The description doesn't specify, but since it's a web UI vulnerability, it's possible that the attack requires user interaction. So I think UI:R is correct here.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject an SQL statement to obtain, update and delete all information in the database. This vulnerability was found in each of the following parameters according to the vulnerability identifier ‘User’ and “email” parameters of the ‘updatePassword’ endpoint.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is an SQL injection in TCMAN's GIM v11. The attacker doesn't need authentication to exploit it, as it's unauthenticated. They can inject SQL statements through the 'User' and 'email' parameters of the 'updatePassword' endpoint, allowing them to obtain, update, and delete all database information.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in an endpoint that's accessible over the network (like a web application), the attack can be done remotely without needing physical access. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. SQL injection typically requires crafting a specific payload, but if the parameters are vulnerable and the attacker can inject SQL without complex steps, it's Low. However, sometimes it might require some knowledge, but generally, SQLi is considered Low complexity. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is about what the attacker needs. The description says it's unauthenticated, so the attacker doesn't need any privileges. Therefore, PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) refers to whether the user needs to do something. Since the attack is through an API endpoint, it's likely that no user interaction is needed. The attacker can send a crafted request directly. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. Since the vulnerability is in the application itself (the GIM v11), the scope is Unchanged (U). If it affected a different component, it would be Changed, but here it's the same.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. The vulnerability allows the attacker to obtain, update, and delete all information. That's a complete loss of confidentiality (C:H), integrity (I:H), and availability (A:H) because they can delete data (affecting availability) and modify it (integrity), and read it (confidentiality). So all three are High (H).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:H.

In versions up to and including 2.5.9, SQL injection occurs because the $origContent parameter in admin/article_save.php is not strictly filtered. Since admin/article_save.php can be accessed by ordinary registered users, this will cause SQL injection to occur when the registered site is enabled, resulting in the injection of the admin account and password, which is then exploited by the backend remote code execution. As of time of publication, it is unknown whether a fix exists.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in Emlog versions up to 2.5.9. The issue is an SQL injection in admin/article_save.php due to the $origContent parameter not being properly filtered. Since this file can be accessed by ordinary registered users, it allows SQL injection when the site is enabled, leading to admin account and password injection, which can be exploited for remote code execution. The fix status is unknown.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in a file that can be accessed by ordinary registered users. Since the attack doesn't require physical access or adjacent network access, and it's over the network (as users can access it via the web), AV should be Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says the parameter isn't strictly filtered. SQL injection typically requires crafting a specific payload, but if it's a simple injection without needing complex steps, AC is Low (L). However, if it's a straightforward case where the input isn't sanitized, maybe it's low. I think Low here.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is exploitable by ordinary registered users. Since they don't need elevated privileges, PR is None (N). Wait, but registered users might have some privileges, but the PR metric is about the level of privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker doesn't need any special privileges beyond being a regular user, then PR is None. But if the user needs to be authenticated, does that count as a privilege? Hmm. The CVSS guidelines say that PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without needing any additional privileges beyond being a regular user, then PR is None. But if the user needs to be authenticated, that might be considered as requiring some privileges. However, in CVSS, PR is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability, not the privileges the user already has. Since the vulnerability is in a part of the system that's accessible to regular users, and the attack doesn't require any additional privileges beyond that, PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention that user interaction is required. Since the attack can be done by sending a crafted request to the admin/article_save.php, which is accessible to registered users, UI is None (N). If the attack required the user to click on a link or something, it would be Required, but here it's a direct exploit.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the admin part of the application) that's being attacked. Since the attack is within the same security scope (the application's backend), S is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed, but here it's within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability allows SQL injection, which can lead to reading or modifying data (C and I) and potentially causing the system to crash (A). However, the description mentions that the injection can be used to get admin credentials, which would impact confidentiality (C: High). The integrity could be high if the attacker can modify data, but the main impact here is on confidentiality. Availability might be low or none unless the attack causes a denial of service. The description doesn't mention availability issues, so A is None. But the problem says that the injection leads to backend remote code execution, which could affect all three. However, the primary impact is on confidentiality (stealing admin credentials) and integrity (modifying data via SQL injection). But the CVSS base metrics for C, I, A are based on the impact. Since the vulnerability allows an attacker to inject SQL, which can read or modify data, and possibly execute arbitrary code (which could affect all three), but the description says it's exploited for remote code execution. However, the initial vulnerability is SQL injection. The CVSS impact metrics are based on the maximum impact. So, if the vulnerability allows for remote code execution, that would be a high impact on all three. But the initial vulnerability is SQL injection. However, the description says that the SQL injection is then exploited for remote code execution. So the primary impact is the SQL injection, but the exploitation leads to RCE. However, for the base score, we need to consider the impact of the vulnerability itself, not the exploitation. Wait, the CVSS base score is based on the vulnerability's inherent characteristics, not the exploitation. So the SQL injection itself allows for data access (confidentiality), data modification (integrity), and possibly denial of service (availability). But the description says that the SQL injection is used to inject admin credentials, leading to RCE. However, the base score would consider the impact of the vulnerability, not the chain of exploitation. So, the SQL injection can allow an attacker to read or modify data, which would be high impact on confidentiality and integrity. Availability might not be affected unless the attack causes the system to crash. Since the description doesn't mention availability, A is None. So C and I would be High, A is None. But I need to check the CVSS guidelines. The impact metrics are determined by the maximum possible impact. If the vulnerability allows for reading data (confidentiality), modifying data (integrity), and possibly causing a denial of service (availability), but the description doesn't mention availability, then C and I are High, A is None. However, if the SQL injection can be used to cause a DoS, then A would be High. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think C and I are High, A is None. But wait, the problem says that the SQL injection is exploited for remote code execution. So the RCE would be a separate vulnerability, but the base score is for the SQL injection. However, the CVSS base score is based on the vulnerability's inherent impact. If the SQL injection can be used to inject arbitrary code (RCE), then that would be a high impact on all three. But the initial vulnerability is SQL injection, which can be used to achieve RCE. However, the CVSS base score is calculated based on the vulnerability's impact. If the SQL injection can be used to execute arbitrary code, then the impact would be High for all three. But the description says that the SQL injection is exploited for RCE. So the base score would consider that the vulnerability allows for RCE, which is a high impact on all three. However, the initial vulnerability is SQL injection, which is a different type of attack. But the CVSS impact metrics are based on the maximum possible impact. So if the SQL injection can be used to achieve RCE, then the impact would be High for all three. But I need to be careful here. The CVSS impact metrics are determined by the potential impact of the vulnerability. If the vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution, then the impact is High for all three. However, the initial vulnerability is SQL injection, which is a different vector. But the problem states that the SQL injection is exploited for RCE. So the base score would consider the impact of the vulnerability, which is the SQL injection, but the exploitation leads to RCE. However, the base score is based on the vulnerability's inherent characteristics. So if the SQL injection can be used to inject arbitrary code (RCE), then the impact would be High for all three. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the impact is only on confidentiality and integrity. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. The impact metrics are determined by the potential impact of the vulnerability. If the vulnerability allows for unauthorized access to data (confidentiality), modification of data (integrity), or disruption of service (availability). In this case, the SQL injection allows an attacker to read or modify data, which would be High for confidentiality and integrity. Availability is not mentioned, so it's None. Therefore, C and I are High, A is None. However, if the SQL injection can be used to cause a DoS, then A would be High. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think C and I are High, A is None. Therefore, the impact metrics are C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but the user interaction is None, and the scope is Unchanged.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the WP Project Manager plugin for WordPress. It's due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when uploading SVG files. The attacker needs to be authenticated with Author-level access or higher to inject scripts that execute when a user accesses the SVG file.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is exploitable via SVG file uploads. Since the plugin is for WordPress, which is a web application, and the attack requires uploading a file, the attack vector is likely Network (N) because it's accessible over the network. Even though the attacker needs to be authenticated, the initial attack vector is still through the network.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions that the attacker needs to upload an SVG file, which might be considered low complexity. However, since it's a stored XSS, the attacker has to create a malicious SVG file and upload it. But the process isn't overly complex, so AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to be authenticated with Author-level access. In WordPress, Author-level access is a specific privilege, so this is not \"None\" but \"Low\" (L) because it's a lower level of privilege compared to Administrator. Wait, but in CVSS, PR is categorized as None, Low, or High. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. However, the exact value depends on the level of access. Since Author is a standard user role with some permissions, but not full admin, it's considered Low (L). But I need to check if \"Low\" applies here. Alternatively, if the attacker needs to have a specific privilege, maybe it's considered Low. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is stored, meaning the attacker doesn't need the user to interact with the malicious content. The script is executed when the user accesses the SVG file, but the user doesn't have to perform any action beyond accessing the page. However, the attacker might need the user to view the page where the SVG is embedded. Wait, stored XSS typically requires the user to view the page where the malicious script is stored. But in this case, the attacker uploads the SVG, and when a user accesses that SVG file, the script runs. So the user interaction is required for the script to execute. Wait, but the user doesn't have to do anything specific beyond accessing the page. However, in CVSS, UI is \"None\" if no user interaction is required beyond the initial attack. Wait, no. For stored XSS, the user interaction is required because the user has to view the page where the malicious script is stored. But in this case, the attacker uploads the SVG, and when a user accesses that SVG file, the script runs. So the user interaction is required for the script to execute. Therefore, UI is Required (R). Wait, but the initial attack (uploading the SVG) requires the attacker to have privileges, but the execution of the script requires the user to access the SVG. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI is Required (R). Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. In CVSS, UI is \"None\" if the attack can be executed without any user interaction, like a buffer overflow. For stored XSS, the user has to view the page, which is considered user interaction. So UI is Required (R). So I think UI is R here.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component (the plugin) that the attacker is interacting with. Since the attack is within the same security scope (the WordPress site), the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same application, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which allows the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts. This can lead to stealing session cookies, which affects confidentiality (C: High). It can also allow the attacker to modify content, affecting integrity (I: High). However, availability isn't directly impacted unless the XSS causes a denial of service, which isn't mentioned here. So A is None (N). Wait, but the description says the attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts. So the impact on confidentiality is high because the attacker can steal data. Integrity is high because they can alter the content. Availability is not mentioned, so it's None. Therefore, C: H, I: H, A: N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low) because the attacker needs Author-level access, which is a privilege but not high.\nUI: R (Required) because the user has to access the SVG file.\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H\nI: H\nA: N\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but earlier I thought UI might be R. Let me confirm again. The user interaction is required for the script to execute, so UI is R. Yes.

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The issue is with the BabelZ WordPress plugin up to version 1.1.5. The problem is that it lacks CSRF checks in some areas and also misses sanitization and escaping. This allows attackers to make a logged-in admin add stored XSS payloads via a CSRF attack.\n\nSo, the main vulnerabilities here are CSRF and stored XSS. Let's break down each metric step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The attack is done via a CSRF attack, which typically requires the user to be tricked into clicking a link or visiting a malicious site. Since the attack is over the network (the user is on the internet, and the attacker sends a request through the network), AV should be Network (N). If it was local, like a local exploit, it would be L, but here it's a remote attack.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is about how complex the attack is. CSRF attacks usually don't require much complexity. The attacker just needs to craft a malicious link or form that the user interacts with. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) refers to the level of access the attacker needs. Since the attack is via CSRF, the attacker doesn't need any special privileges. The user (admin) is already authenticated, and the attacker is exploiting that session. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is whether the user needs to interact with the attack. CSRF attacks typically require the user to click on a link or visit a malicious site. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but the description says \"make logged in admin add Stored XSS payloads via a CSRF attack.\" So the admin has to be tricked into clicking the link, which requires user interaction. Therefore, UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). Since the plugin is part of WordPress, and the attack is within the same application context, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed, but here it's within the same application.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. The vulnerability allows stored XSS, which can lead to data exfiltration (confidentiality), data modification (integrity), and potentially denial of service (availability). However, the description specifically mentions stored XSS payloads. Stored XSS can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server and executed when other users view the page. This can lead to stealing session cookies (confidentiality), altering content (integrity), and maybe even causing the site to be unavailable if the XSS is used to crash the server. But the primary impact here is on confidentiality and integrity. However, the CVSS impact metrics are based on the maximum impact. Since the attack can lead to both confidentiality and integrity issues, but the description doesn't mention availability, I think the impact for confidentiality and integrity would be High (H), and availability would be None (N). Wait, but stored XSS can also affect availability if the injected script causes the site to crash. However, the description doesn't mention that. So maybe the availability is None. But the CVSS impact metrics are based on the potential for each. Since the vulnerability allows for stored XSS, which can be used to steal data (C: High) and modify data (I: High), but not necessarily affect availability. So C and I are High, A is None.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but I need to check if UI is Required. The user interaction is required because the admin has to click on the malicious link. So UI is R. But sometimes, in CSRF, the user interaction is required. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in some cases, if the attack can be done without user interaction, like a network-based exploit, but CSRF requires the user to interact. So yes, UI is R here.\n\nSo the final vector string is AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Admire Extra WordPress plugin. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the'space' shortcode. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject scripts, which then execute when users access the affected pages.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means the payload is stored on the server and executed when a user accesses the page. Since it's stored, the attack can be initiated remotely without needing direct access to the system. So AV is Network (N), because the attacker doesn't need to be physically present or adjacent; they can exploit it over the network.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says the attacker needs to inject the script via the shortcode. Since it's a stored XSS, the attacker just needs to find a way to inject the malicious code, which might be straightforward if the input isn't properly sanitized. However, the attacker needs to be authenticated. But the AC metric considers the complexity of the attack, not the privileges required. Since the attack is stored and doesn't require complex steps beyond exploiting the input vulnerability, I think AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs contributor-level access or higher. In WordPress, contributor access allows editing posts but not necessarily full administrative rights. However, the vulnerability is stored, so once the attacker has the necessary access, they can inject the script. Since the attacker must be authenticated, PR is Low (L) because contributor-level access is a lower privilege than administrative, but not none. Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. But contributor-level is a specific role. However, in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges needed. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. But the options are N, L, H. Since contributor is a lower privilege than admin, but not zero, maybe PR is Low (L). Alternatively, if the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, it's N. But here, the attacker must be authenticated, so PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). Stored XSS doesn't require user interaction. The script is stored and executed when the user accesses the page. So UI is None (N), because the user doesn't need to interact with the attack vector; it's automatically executed when they view the page.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component where the attack is initiated. Since the plugin is part of the WordPress site, and the attack is within the same application context, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same application.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). For a stored XSS, the main impact is on confidentiality and integrity. The attacker can steal session cookies (confidentiality), inject malicious scripts (integrity), and potentially cause denial of service (availability), but the primary impact here is on confidentiality and integrity. The description mentions that the attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts, which can lead to data theft or manipulation. So C is High (H), I is High (H), and A is None (N) unless the XSS can cause the site to be unavailable, which isn't mentioned here.

In versions 0.6.8 and prior, a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY AI where normal users are improperly granted permissions to export APP DSL. The feature in '/export' should only allow administrator users to export DSL. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can export the APP DSL. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.13.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in Dify versions up to 0.6.8 where normal users can export APP DSL, which should only be allowed for administrators. The fix involves updating access controls to enforce RBAC.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability allows normal users to perform an action that should be restricted. Since the export feature is likely accessible via a web interface, which is over the network, AV is probably Network (N). If it required local access or physical access, that would be different, but the description doesn't mention that. So AV=N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The vulnerability is due to a misconfiguration in access control. Exploiting it might not require complex steps. If a user can just access the /export endpoint without needing to bypass any complex mechanisms, then AC is Low (L). If it required specific conditions or steps, it might be High, but here it's a permissions issue, so likely Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The user doesn't need any special privileges beyond being a normal user. Since the vulnerability allows normal users to do something they shouldn't, PR is None (N). If the attacker needed admin rights, it would be High, but here it's the opposite.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability doesn't require any user interaction. The user just accesses the endpoint. So UI is None (N). If the attack required the user to click a link or something, it would be Required, but here it's automatic.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability affects the same component where the attack is initiated. If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it might be Changed, but here it's within the same application's access control.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are all High (H) because the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to export data (confidentiality), which could compromise the integrity of the system by allowing unauthorized modifications, and availability might be affected if the export feature is misused. However, the description specifically mentions exporting DSL, which is more about confidentiality and integrity. Availability isn't directly mentioned, but since the export is a feature that's being misused, maybe it's not affecting availability. Wait, the problem is that users can export something they shouldn't, which could lead to data leakage (confidentiality) and possibly integrity if they modify the DSL. But the availability isn't mentioned. Hmm, the CVSS metrics for C, I, A are based on the impact. If the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to data, that's confidentiality (C=H). If it allows unauthorized modification, that's integrity (I=H). If it causes a denial of service, that's availability (A=H). The description says the export is a feature that should be restricted. Exporting data would be a confidentiality issue. But if the export could be used to modify the DSL, that's integrity. However, the description doesn't mention modification, just export. So maybe C=H, I=N, A=N. Wait, but the original problem is that users can export the DSL, which might contain sensitive information. So confidentiality is high. Integrity might not be affected unless the export allows modification. Availability isn't mentioned. So C=H, I=N, A=N. But I need to check the CVSS guidelines. The impact metrics are based on whether the vulnerability can lead to a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Since the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to data (exporting), that's a confidentiality impact. If the export could be used to alter data, that's integrity. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think C=H, I=N, A=N. Wait, but the original problem is that the access control is misconfigured, allowing users to perform an action they shouldn't. The impact here is that the user can access data they shouldn't, which is confidentiality. So C=H. Integrity and availability are not directly impacted unless the export leads to data modification or service disruption. Since the description doesn't mention that, I and A are N. But I'm a bit uncertain here. Let me think again. The export of DSL might be a configuration file. If a user can export it, they might be able to see sensitive configurations, which is confidentiality. If they can modify it, that's integrity. But the vulnerability is about access, not modification. So I think C=H, I=N, A=N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but the CVSS v3.1 base score calculation for impact uses the formula. If C, I, A are all H, then the impact is high. But if only C is H, then the impact is medium. Wait, the impact metrics are calculated based on whether the vulnerability can affect confidentiality, integrity, or availability. If the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to data (confidentiality), then C=H. If the vulnerability allows unauthorized modification (integrity), then I=H. If it causes a denial of service (availability), then A=H. In this case, the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to export data, which is a confidentiality issue. So C=H. Integrity and availability are not affected. Therefore, the impact is calculated as follows:\n\nImpact = 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - 0.57) * (1 - 0.57)) + (1 - (1 - 0.57) * (1 - 0.57)) + (1 - (1 - 0.57) * (1 - 0.57))]?\n\nWait, no. The impact score is calculated using the formula:\n\nImpact = 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) - 0.16] if the scope is unchanged, or 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) - 0.16] if scope is changed. Wait, the formula is:\n\nImpact = 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) - 0.16] if the scope is unchanged, or 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) - 0.16] if the scope is changed. Wait, no, the formula is:\n\nImpact = 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) - 0.16] if the scope is unchanged, or 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) - 0.16] if the scope is changed. Wait, I think I need to recall the exact formula. The impact score is calculated as:\n\nImpact = 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) - 0.16] if the scope is unchanged, or 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) - 0.16] if the scope is changed. Wait, no, the formula is:\n\nImpact = 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) - 0.16] if the scope is unchanged, or 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) - 0.16] if the scope is changed. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 formula.\n\nThe impact score is calculated as:\n\nImpact = 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) - 0.16] if the scope is unchanged (S=U), or 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) - 0.16] if the scope is changed (S=C). Wait, no, the formula is:\n\nImpact = 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) - 0.16] if the scope is unchanged, or 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) - 0.16] if the scope is changed. Wait, that can't be right. The actual formula is:\n\nImpact = 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) - 0.16] if the scope is unchanged (S=U), or 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)) - 0.16] if the scope is changed (S=C). Wait, no, the formula is different for S=U and S=C. Let me recall:\n\nFor S=U (Unchanged), the impact is calculated as:\n\nImpact = 1.08 * [(1 - (1 - C", "prediction": "", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

It was found from vmcore that perf had registered two ops with the same content successively, both dynamic. After unregistering the second ops, a use-after-free occurred. In ftrace_shutdown(), when the second ops is unregistered, the FTRACE_UPDATE_CALLS command is not set because there is another enabled ops with the same content. Also, both ops are dynamic and the ftrace callback function is ftrace_ops_list_func, so the FTRACE_UPDATE_TRACE_FUNC command will not be set. Eventually the value of 'command' will be 0 and ftrace_shutdown() will skip the rcu synchronization. However, ftrace may be activated. When the ops is released, another CPU may be accessing the ops. Add the missing synchronization to fix this problem.

First, I need to understand the vulnerability described in the CVE. The issue is a use-after-free in the Linux kernel's ftrace component. The problem arises when two dynamic ftrace_ops are registered with the same content, and after unregistering the second one, a use-after-free occurs because the synchronization is missing. This can lead to a situation where another CPU might access the freed memory, causing a crash or potential exploitation.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a use-after-free, it's likely that an attacker would need to have some way to trigger this. However, the vulnerability is in the kernel, which is typically accessed via the network or local. But since the CVE description doesn't mention any network exposure, and the issue is in the kernel's internal handling, I think the attack vector is Local (L). Wait, but wait. The use-after-free could be triggered by a local user with elevated privileges, like a local attacker. However, if the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, then AV would be Network (N). But the description doesn't mention any remote exploitation. The example in the KASAN report shows a task syz-executor, which is a fuzzing tool, so maybe this is a local issue. So AV is Local (L). Hmm, but sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger them. However, without more info, I think AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a use-after-free, which typically requires specific conditions to be triggered. However, if the attacker can create the scenario where the two dynamic ops are registered and then unregistered, the complexity might be Low (L) because it's a straightforward exploit once the conditions are met. But if it's complex to set up, maybe High (H). The description says that the issue is due to a missing synchronization when unregistering the second ops. So, an attacker would need to register two dynamic ops with the same content, then trigger the unregistration. That might be a specific scenario, but if it's possible with a crafted input, maybe AC is Low. I think AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Since this is a kernel vulnerability, an attacker would need to have some level of privileges. If the vulnerability can be exploited by a local user with normal privileges, then PR is Low (L). But if it requires root or high privileges, then High (H). The use-after-free in the kernel could be exploited by a local user with elevated privileges, but maybe even a regular user could trigger it if they can manipulate the ftrace_ops. However, the PR metric in CVSS v3.1 considers the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have the same privileges as the user who is running the code that triggers the vulnerability, then PR is Low. But if the attacker needs to have high privileges (like root), then High. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit would require the attacker to have the ability to register and unregister ftrace_ops, which might require root or some elevated privileges. However, if the attacker can do this without elevated privileges, then PR is Low. The description doesn't specify, but in many cases, kernel vulnerabilities require high privileges. However, sometimes they can be exploited with lower privileges. This is a bit tricky. Maybe I should go with High (H) because kernel-level vulnerabilities often require high privileges. Wait, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability, not the privileges required to have the vulnerability. For example, if the vulnerability is in a service that runs as a user, then PR would be Low. But in the kernel, which runs with high privileges, the attacker would need to have the ability to trigger the vulnerability, which might require root. So PR is High (H). Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check examples. For example, a kernel vulnerability that can be triggered by a local user with normal privileges would have PR: Low. If it requires root, then High. Since the CVE is in the kernel, and the exploit would require the attacker to have the ability to register ftrace_ops, which might be possible with root privileges. So PR is High (H). But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that can be accessed by a local user without needing root, then PR is Low. This is a bit ambiguous. Maybe I should go with High (H) as a default for kernel vulnerabilities unless stated otherwise.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a use-after-free that can be triggered by the attacker's input. If the attacker needs to interact with the system (e.g., run a specific program), then UI is Required (R). If it can be triggered automatically without user interaction, then UI is None (N). The example in the KASAN report shows a task syz-executor, which is a fuzzing tool, so it's possible that the vulnerability can be triggered without user interaction. However, in a real-world scenario, the attacker might need to run a specific exploit code. But the UI metric is about whether user interaction is required. If the exploit can be triggered without any user action, then UI is None. If the user has to perform an action (like opening a file), then Required. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and can be triggered by a local process, it might not require user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel) that is being attacked. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component (like a different service), then it would be Changed (C). But here, the vulnerability is within the kernel, so S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability is a use-after-free, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. If an attacker can exploit this, they could potentially read or write memory, leading to a breach of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Since the vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution, all three (C, I, A) would be High (H). However, the exact impact depends on the exploit. If the vulnerability can be used to read memory (confidentiality), write memory (integrity), or cause a denial of service (availability), then all three are High. In this case, a use-after-free can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, which would affect all three. So C, I, A are all High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) – The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is accessed locally.\nAC: Low (L) – The exploit requires specific conditions but is not complex.\nPR: High (H) – Exploitation requires high privileges (like root).\nUI: None (N) – No user interaction is needed.\nS: Unchanged (U) – The vulnerability affects the same component.\nC: High (H) – Confidentiality is impacted.\nI: High (H) – Integrity is impacted.\nA: High (H) – Availability is impacted.\n\nNow, the CVSS vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the PR. If the PR is High, then that's correct. But maybe in some cases, kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited with lower privileges. For example, if the attacker can run a local program that triggers the vulnerability, they might not need root. However, in the kernel, most operations require root. So I think PR is High (H) is correct here.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 1.0999999999999996, "success": true}

This issue is fixed in macOS Sequoia 15.3, Safari 18.3, iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3, visionOS 2.3. A maliciously crafted webpage may be able to fingerprint the user.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The issue is about a maliciously crafted webpage being able to fingerprint the user. The fix was improved access restrictions to the file system, and it's addressed in various versions of macOS, Safari, iOS, etc.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions a malicious webpage, which implies that the attack can be initiated over a network, like through a web browser. So AV is likely Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The vulnerability allows fingerprinting via a webpage, which might not require complex steps. If it's something that can be done easily, like just visiting a site, then AC is Low (L). But if it requires specific conditions or steps, maybe High. However, since it's a webpage, I think it's Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The user doesn't need any special privileges to exploit this. The webpage can do it without the user having elevated rights. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The attack requires the user to interact, like visiting the malicious webpage. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but the description says \"may be able to fingerprint the user\" through a webpage. If the user has to click on something or visit the site, then UI is Required. If it's automatic, like when the user visits the site, maybe it's still Required. So I think UI is R.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component where the attack is initiated. Since it's a browser vulnerability, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allows access to other components, it would be Changed, but here it's about the browser itself, so S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A). The issue is fingerprinting the user. Fingerprinting typically relates to gathering information about the user, which affects confidentiality. However, if the attack can't access sensitive data, maybe it's Low. But if it can collect enough info to identify the user, that's a confidentiality impact. However, the description doesn't mention data leakage, just fingerprinting. So maybe C is Low or None. Wait, the CVSS metrics for confidentiality: if the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to information, then C is High. If it's just identifying the user through browser characteristics (like user agent, screen resolution, etc.), that's not accessing confidential data. So maybe C is None. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the fingerprinting can be used to track the user, that might be considered a confidentiality issue. Hmm. This is tricky. Let me think again. The vulnerability allows fingerprinting, which could be used to track the user across sites, which might be a privacy issue. But in CVSS terms, confidentiality is about unauthorized access to information. If the attack doesn't access data but just identifies the user through browser features, maybe C is None. But I'm not certain. Maybe the impact is Low. Alternatively, if the fingerprinting can be used to infer sensitive information, then C could be High. But the description doesn't specify that. So I'll go with C: None.\n\nIntegrity (I) and Availability (A). The vulnerability doesn't seem to allow modifying data or causing denial of service. So I and A are None. But wait, if the fingerprinting could be used to inject malicious content, but the description doesn't mention that. So I and A are None.\n\nWait, but the CVSS base metrics for confidentiality, integrity, and availability are whether the vulnerability can impact those aspects. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to gather information about the user (like fingerprinting), that's a confidentiality impact. However, the CVSS metrics for confidentiality are whether the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to information. If the fingerprinting is just collecting information that the user has already exposed (like browser settings), then it's not a confidentiality issue. But if the attacker can get information that the user shouldn't be able to access, then it's a confidentiality impact. The description says \"fingerprint the user,\" which is typically about collecting information that's not confidential, like browser features. So maybe C is None. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the fingerprinting can be used to track the user across sites, which is a privacy concern, but in CVSS terms, that might not be considered a confidentiality impact. So I think C is None.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but the user interaction is required because the user has to visit the malicious webpage. So UI is R. But if the attack is automatic when the user visits the site, maybe it's still required. So UI: R.\n\nBut I need to check the CVSS guidelines. For UI, if the attack requires the user to take action, like visiting a site, then it's Required. If it's a drive-by download, it's still Required. So yes, UI: R.\n\nSo the vector string would be:\n\nAV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N\n\nBut wait, the initial thought was that the confidentiality impact is None. However, if the fingerprinting allows the attacker to gather information that the user didn't intend to share, that might be considered a confidentiality impact. But according to the CVSS, confidentiality is about unauthorized access to information. If the information is already accessible (like browser features), then it's not a confidentiality issue. So C: N.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused here. Let me check an example. For example, a vulnerability that allows an attacker to read a user's cookies would be a confidentiality impact. But if the attacker can only gather information that the user has already sent (like user agent string), that's not a confidentiality issue. So in this case, since the vulnerability is about fingerprinting, which is about collecting information that's not confidential, then C: N.\n\nTherefore, the final vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N\n\nBut wait, the initial answer I thought of had C, I, A as N. However, maybe the impact is Low? Let me think again. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to gather information that could be used to identify the user, which could be considered a confidentiality impact. But according to the CVSS, the confidentiality impact is High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to access all the information, Low if some, and None if no. Since the vulnerability allows fingerprinting, which is a form of information leakage, but not necessarily accessing all information, maybe it's Low. However, the description doesn't specify the extent of the information. If the CVSS guidelines say that any information leakage is considered Low, then C: L. But I'm not sure. The problem is that the CVE description is vague. The user might have to make an educated guess here.\n\nAlternatively, if the vulnerability is about fingerprinting, which is a privacy issue but not a confidentiality impact in the traditional sense, then C: N. But I'm not certain. This is a point of ambiguity. However, given the information provided, I think the safest choice is C: N, I: N, A: N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 2.2, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Bandsintown Events plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the 'bandsintown_events' shortcode. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject scripts, which then execute when users access the affected pages.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in a WordPress plugin, and the attack requires the attacker to have contributor-level access, which is a user privilege, but the initial injection might be via the plugin's shortcode. However, the attack vector here is through the web application, so the attacker doesn't need physical access or adjacent network. It's more likely a network-based attack because the attacker can exploit it over the network by submitting the malicious input through the web interface. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description mentions that the attacker needs to inject the script, but since it's a stored XSS, the complexity is low. The attacker just needs to find a way to inject the script into the system, which might be straightforward if the input isn't properly sanitized. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access. In WordPress, contributor access allows users to create and edit their own posts, but not necessarily to inject scripts into shortcodes. However, the vulnerability allows authenticated users with contributor access to inject scripts. So the privileges required are Low (L) because the attacker needs some level of access but not administrative. Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege, so PR would be Low (L) since contributor access is a lower privilege than admin. But I need to check the CVSS definitions. According to CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege, so PR is Low (L) if the required privileges are low. But if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a requirement, so maybe PR is Low. Alternatively, if the attacker can exploit it without authentication, PR is None. But here, the attacker must be authenticated, so PR is Low (L) because they need some level of access, but not high. Wait, the options are N, L, H. So if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege, so PR is Low (L) if the required privileges are considered low. For example, in WordPress, contributor access is a lower privilege than admin. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is stored, meaning the attacker injects the script into the system, and when a user accesses the page, the script executes. However, the user interaction here is required for the attack to be successful. Wait, no. In stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact with the attacker's input. The script is stored and executed when the user accesses the page. However, the initial injection might require the attacker to have access to inject the script, which they do through their own posts or pages. But the user interaction (UI) metric refers to whether the user needs to interact with the attack for it to be successful. In stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact with the attacker's input; the script is executed automatically when the user views the page. Therefore, UI is None (N). Wait, but the user has to access the page where the script is stored. However, the UI metric is about whether the user needs to interact with the attack vector. For example, if the attack requires the user to click a link, that's Required (R). In stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact beyond accessing the page. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component where the attack is initiated. Since the plugin is part of the WordPress application, and the attack is within the same application context, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component (like a different system), it would be Changed (C). Here, it's within the same application, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which can lead to stealing user data (like session cookies), modifying content, or causing other issues. However, the impact metrics are based on the potential impact. For confidentiality, if the attacker can steal data, that's High (H). For integrity, if the attacker can modify content, that's High (H). For availability, if the attack can cause a denial of service, but stored XSS typically doesn't affect availability. However, the description doesn't mention availability impact, so A is None (N). But wait, the CVSS v3.1 impact metrics are based on the potential impact. Since the vulnerability allows arbitrary script execution, which can lead to data exfiltration (C: H), data modification (I: H), and possibly other issues. However, the availability is not mentioned, so A is None (N). But I need to check the standard for XSS. Stored XSS can lead to confidentiality and integrity issues, but not necessarily availability. So C: H, I: H, A: N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low) – because the attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a privilege, but not high.\nUI: N (None) – because the user doesn't need to interact beyond accessing the page.\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, constructing the vector string:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but earlier I thought PR might be N. Let me recheck. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access. According to CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege. The options are N (None), L (Low), H (High). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege, so PR is Low (L) if the required privileges are considered low. In WordPress, contributor access is a lower privilege than admin, so PR is Low (L). So the initial choice of PR: L is correct.\n\nBut wait, the CVSS PR metric for authenticated users: if the attacker needs to be authenticated, then PR is Low (L) if the required privileges are low. For example, if the attacker needs to be a regular user, that's Low. If they need admin, that's High. So contributor access is Low. So PR is L.\n\nSo the final vector is AV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

The issue occurs due to an incorrect packet length check that allows an integer overflow when handling large payload sizes on 32-bit systems. This issue leads to failed memory allocation and causes the server process to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the SFTP server message decoding logic of libssh. The problem arises from an incorrect packet length check that allows an integer overflow when handling large payloads on 32-bit systems. This leads to failed memory allocation and a server crash, causing a denial of service (DoS).\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the SFTP server, which is typically accessed over a network. Since the attack doesn't require physical access or adjacent systems, AV should be Network (N).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions an integer overflow due to incorrect packet length checks. Exploiting this would require sending a specially crafted payload with a large size. However, since it's a straightforward overflow that can be triggered by sending a specific packet, the complexity is Low (L). No complex steps are needed beyond sending the malformed packet.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability is in the server process. To exploit it, an attacker would need to connect to the SFTP server, which typically doesn't require any authentication. So, the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges. Therefore, PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The attack is automated; the user doesn't need to interact with the system for the exploit to work. The server crashes upon receiving the malformed packet. So, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability exists in the server component, and the impact is on the same component.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability was partially patched in the BuddyBoss Platform plugin in version 2.8.41.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the BuddyBoss Platform plugin and theme for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, allowing authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access to inject arbitrary web scripts. The scripts execute when a user accesses the injected page.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means the payload is stored on the server and executed when a user accesses the page. Since it's stored, the attack vector is likely Network (N) because the attacker doesn't need to be on the same network or physical proximity. The user just needs to access the page, which is over the network. So AV is N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Stored XSS typically requires the attacker to have a way to inject the payload into the system. However, once the payload is stored, it's executed when a user views the page. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps beyond injecting the script. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The description says authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access. Subscriber is a low-level privilege in WordPress. So the attacker needs to be authenticated, but with low privileges. Therefore, PR is Low (L). Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). Since the attacker needs to be authenticated, even with low privileges, that's not None. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Stored XSS doesn't require user interaction. The script is executed when the user accesses the page, but the user doesn't need to do anything specific beyond viewing the page. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the plugin/theme) that the attacker is interacting with. Since the attack is within the same security scope (the application), the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same application. So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): XSS can lead to stealing session cookies or other sensitive data, which would impact confidentiality. Since the attacker can inject scripts that read data from the page, this is a High impact. So C is H.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject scripts that modify the content of the page, which affects the integrity of the data. So I is H.\n\nAvailability (A): XSS can cause denial of service by injecting scripts that crash the browser or consume resources, but the primary impact here is on confidentiality and integrity. However, the description doesn't mention availability issues. So A is N. Wait, but sometimes XSS can be used to launch attacks that affect availability, but unless specified, it's safer to assume it's not a direct impact. The CVE description doesn't mention availability, so A is N.\n\nWait, but the problem says to determine each metric. Let me check again. The vulnerability allows injecting scripts that execute when a user accesses the page. The impact on confidentiality is high because the attacker can steal data. Integrity is high because they can alter the content. Availability isn't mentioned, so it's None. So C, I are H, A is N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but I need to confirm the PR. The attacker needs to be authenticated with Subscriber access. In CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, even with low privileges, then PR is Low (L). If the attacker didn't need any privileges, it would be N. Since the attacker must be authenticated, PR is L. So that's correct.\n\nAnother check: UI is None because the user doesn't need to interact beyond viewing the page. So UI is N.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the final vector string is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

The exploit requires the user to navigate to a malicious page during the SAML login process. It's specific to Windows, not other platforms.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The attacker is remote, so AV is Network (N). The exploit doesn't require physical access or adjacent network, so N makes sense.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says the attacker needs the user to navigate to a malicious page. That seems like a low complexity because it's a straightforward action, not requiring complex steps. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs an authenticated user.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into an already existing query to store cross-site scripting in store reviews.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Super Store Finder plugin for WordPress, specifically an SQL Injection through the'ssf_wp_user_name' parameter. It's present in all versions up to and including 7.0. The issue is due to insufficient escaping and lack of proper SQL query preparation, allowing unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries to store XSS in store reviews.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is exploitable via a parameter in a web application, which is accessible over the network. So AV should be Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description mentions that the attacker can inject SQL by appending queries. If it's a simple injection without needing complex steps, AC is Low (L). Since it's a straightforward SQL injection, I think AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker is unauthenticated, so they don't need any privileges. Therefore, PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack doesn't require any user interaction. The attacker can exploit it directly without needing a user to perform an action. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the WordPress plugin, which is part of the same system. Since the attack affects the same component, the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): SQL injection can lead to data leakage, so Confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject malicious data, like XSS, which affects the integrity of the data. So Integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability allows appending queries, which might cause denial of service, but the description doesn't mention availability impact. However, since SQL injection can sometimes lead to data corruption or system crashes, but the main impact here is on confidentiality and integrity. But the problem statement says \"store cross-site scripting in store reviews,\" which is more about integrity. However, the CVSS might still consider availability as High if the attack can cause the system to crash. Wait, the description doesn't mention availability issues. So maybe Availability is None (N). Hmm, but sometimes SQL injection can be used to delete data or cause the database to crash, which would affect availability. However, the given description doesn't specify that. The main impact here is storing XSS, which is integrity. So maybe Availability is None. But I need to check the standard for CVSS. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data (like injecting XSS), that's integrity. Availability would be if the attack can make the service unavailable. Since the description doesn't mention that, I think A is None (N). Wait, but the original problem says \"store cross-site scripting in store reviews,\" which is about integrity. So I think A is N.\n\nWait, but the CVSS v3.1 base score calculation for availability: if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a denial of service, then A is H. If not, then N. Since the description doesn't mention availability impact, I should go with N.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm if the scope is changed. The scope is whether the vulnerability affects a different component than the one being attacked. Since the plugin is part of the WordPress system, and the attack is on the same component, the scope is unchanged (U). So that's correct.\n\nAnother check: the attack vector is network because it's a web parameter. Attack complexity is low because it's a simple injection.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the WP-Asambleas plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the 'polls_popup' shortcode. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts, which execute when a user accesses the affected page.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means the payload is stored on the server and executed when a user accesses the page. Since the attacker doesn't need to be on the same network or physical location, but the attack is triggered through the web application, the attack vector is Network (N). So AV is N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). Stored XSS typically requires the attacker to have some way to inject the payload, but once that's done, the exploit is straightforward. Since the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps beyond injecting the script, AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The description mentions that the attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access. Contributor-level access in WordPress is a specific privilege, so the attacker must have some level of access. However, the exact privilege level might be considered as Low (L) because contributor access is a standard user role that can create and edit content, but not necessarily administrative tasks. However, the CVSS PR metric considers the level of privileges required. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated, but not necessarily with high privileges, but contributor is a specific role. Wait, the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege, but the PR metric is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, but the system allows that, then PR would be Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need high-level privileges, just a user account. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). Stored XSS doesn't require user interaction once the payload is injected. The user just needs to access the page where the script is stored. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component where the attack is initiated. Since the plugin is part of the WordPress application, and the attack is within the same application context, the scope is Unchanged (U). So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). For a stored XSS, the primary impact is on integrity and confidentiality. The attacker can inject scripts that steal session cookies (confidentiality) or alter the page content (integrity). Availability might not be directly impacted unless the script causes a denial of service, which isn't mentioned here. So C is High (H) because the attacker can steal sensitive information. I is High (H) because the attacker can modify the content. A is None (N) since there's no mention of availability impact.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the PR was considered as Low (L) because the attacker needs contributor access. But in CVSS, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered as requiring some privileges. However, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, but the system allows that, then PR is Low. If the attacker needs administrative privileges, it's High. Since contributor is a standard user role, PR is Low. So the metrics are as above.\n\nNow, constructing the vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but the original answer example had A:H. Wait, in the example, the user had A:H. But in this case, the availability isn't impacted. So A should be N. Let me check again. The vulnerability is stored XSS, which allows the attacker to inject scripts that execute when users access the page. This can lead to stealing cookies (confidentiality), altering content (integrity), but not necessarily affecting availability. So A is N. Therefore, the correct vector is AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. The CVE is about a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Pago por Redsys WordPress plugin. The description says it's due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject scripts via the 'Ds_MerchantParameters' parameter. The user needs to click a link to trigger it.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is exploited via a parameter in a request, which is typically over the network. Since it's a reflected XSS, the attacker would send a malicious link (like via email or a website) that the user clicks. So the attack vector is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Reflected XSS usually requires the user to click on a crafted link. The attacker doesn't need to do anything complex beyond creating the link. So the complexity is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any authentication to exploit this. The user is the one who clicks the link, but the attacker doesn't need to be authenticated. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The user has to click the link for the script to execute. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but in some cases, if the attack can be done without user interaction, like through a drive-by download, but here it's reflected XSS, which requires the user to interact. So yes, UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the plugin, which is part of the WordPress application. The attack affects the same component, so the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed, but here it's within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C): XSS can steal session cookies or other data, leading to unauthorized access. So the impact on confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject scripts that modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user. So integrity impact is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): XSS typically doesn't affect availability directly, unless the script causes a denial of service. But the description doesn't mention that. So availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nWait, but the UI is Required (R) because the user has to click the link. So that's correct. The other metrics seem to align with the vulnerability type. Let me double-check each one again.\n\nYes, AV is Network, AC is Low, PR is None, UI is Required, Scope Unchanged, and the impacts are High for confidentiality and integrity, None for availability. That should be the correct set of metrics.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Table Editor plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the 'wptableeditor_vtabs' shortcode. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject scripts that execute when a user accesses the affected page.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in a WordPress plugin and the attack requires the attacker to have contributor-level access, which is a user account on the WordPress site, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the system. Wait, but wait—stored XSS can be triggered by a user accessing a page, so maybe the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker can inject the script into the site, and any user visiting the page would be affected. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Stored XSS is usually considered as having a Network attack vector because the payload is stored on the server and delivered to users over the network. So AV is probably Network (N).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires the attacker to inject the script, but since it's stored, the complexity might be Low (L) because the attacker just needs to find a way to inject the script, which in this case is via the shortcode. No complex steps needed beyond exploiting the input vulnerability. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access. Contributor access in WordPress allows users to create and edit posts but not publish them. However, the vulnerability allows them to inject scripts. Since the attacker needs to have some level of access (contributor or higher), PR is Low (L) because it's not high-level privileges but still requires some access. Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege, so PR would be Low (L) because it's not requiring administrative privileges but still some level of access. Alternatively, if the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, it would be N. But here, the attacker must be authenticated, so PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). For stored XSS, user interaction is not required because the script is stored on the server and executed when the user accesses the page. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component (the plugin) that the user is interacting with. Since the attack is within the same scope (the plugin's functionality), the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). Since it's a stored XSS, the main impact is on integrity and confidentiality. The attacker can inject scripts that steal session cookies (confidentiality) or alter the page content (integrity). Availability might not be directly affected unless the script causes a denial of service, which isn't mentioned here. So C is High (H) because the attacker can steal sensitive information. I is High (H) because the attacker can modify the content. A is None (N) because there's no mention of availability impact.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the PR was a bit confusing. Let me check again. The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a privilege. So PR is Low (L) because it's not high but requires some access. So the metrics are:\n\nAV: Network (N) – because the attack is delivered over the network when the user accesses the page.\nAC: Low (L) – the attack is straightforward once the user has access.\nPR: Low (L) – requires contributor-level access.\nUI: None (N) – no user interaction needed beyond the initial injection.\nS: Unchanged (U) – the vulnerability is in the same component.\nC: High (H) – data can be stolen.\nI: High (H) – content can be altered.\nA: None (N) – no impact on availability.\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but the original answer example had A:H. Did I make a mistake here? Let me recheck the availability. The CVE description doesn't mention any impact on availability, so A should be None (N). So the final vector is AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. But I need to confirm if the stored XSS can affect availability. Typically, stored XSS is about confidentiality and integrity, not availability.

An attacker can extract information from the database in function listCount in the WorkflowDAO interface. The workflowtype and status parameters can be used to build a SQL query.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation for the given CVE. First, I need to understand the vulnerability described. The CVE is about SQL Injection in OpenMetadata versions up to 1.4.1. The attacker can extract database information using the listCount function in the WorkflowDAO interface by manipulating the workflowtype and status parameters to build a SQL query.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in a web application and the parameters are passed through HTTP requests, the attack can be done remotely over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. SQL injection typically requires crafting a specific payload, but if the parameters are directly used in queries without proper sanitization, it might be low complexity. The attacker just needs to inject malicious SQL, which is a common attack vector. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) – the attacker doesn't need any prior authentication. They can exploit this by sending a crafted request, so PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) – the attack doesn't require any user interaction. The attacker can send the malicious request directly. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) – the vulnerability affects the same component that's being attacked, so the scope is Unchanged (U). If it affected a different component, it would be Changed, but here it's the same service.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) – SQL injection can lead to data leakage (C: High), data modification (I: High), and potentially denial of service if the query is crafted to crash the database (A: High). But the description mentions extracting information, so maybe A is Low or None? Wait, the description says \"extract information from the database\", which is confidentiality. The availability isn't mentioned. However, SQL injection can sometimes affect availability, but since the CVE description doesn't mention it, maybe A is None. But I need to check. The original description says the attacker can extract information, so C is High. Integrity might be High if the attacker can modify data, but the description doesn't mention that. Wait, the parameters are used to build a SQL query. If the attacker can inject, they might be able to read or modify data. But the description only mentions extracting information, so maybe I is Low or None? Hmm. The CVSS guidelines say that if the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data, then I is High. But the description doesn't specify that. However, SQL injection can allow both read and write, so maybe I is High. But the CVE description only mentions extracting, so maybe I is Low? Or is it possible that the attacker could inject a query that modifies data? The problem is that the description is limited. Since the parameters are used to build the query, if the attacker can inject, they can read or write. But the description only mentions extraction. However, in practice, SQL injection can allow both. But the CVSS metrics are based on the potential impact, not just what's explicitly stated. So maybe I is High. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the vulnerability is only about reading, then I is Low. But the standard for CVSS is that if the vulnerability allows modification, then I is High. Since the parameters are used in a query, the attacker could inject a query that modifies data, even if the description doesn't mention it. So I would be High. Similarly, availability might be High if the attacker can cause the database to crash, but again, the description doesn't mention that. So A is None. But I need to check the CVSS guidelines. The CVSS v3.1 base score calculation for confidentiality, integrity, and availability is based on whether the vulnerability can impact each. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data, then C is High. If it allows modification, I is High. If it can cause denial of service, A is High. Since the description only mentions extraction (reading), but the vulnerability is SQL injection, which can allow both read and write, but the description doesn't specify. However, the CVSS guidelines might require that if the vulnerability can be used to modify data, then I is High. But without explicit mention, maybe it's safer to assume that only confidentiality is impacted. However, in practice, SQL injection can allow both. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the CVSS documentation. According to the CVSS v3.1 guidelines, for Integrity (I), if the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data, then I is High. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify data, even if not explicitly stated, but the vulnerability type (SQL injection) can allow that, then I is High. So I think I should set I to High. Availability (A) is None unless the vulnerability can cause a denial of service. Since the description doesn't mention that, A is None. So the metrics would be C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the original description says \"extract information from the database\", which is confidentiality. So C is High. Integrity and Availability are not mentioned, but the vulnerability type (SQL injection) can allow modification, so I is High. But if the attacker can't modify data, then I is Low. However, the parameters are used to build the query, so the attacker could inject a query that modifies data. Therefore, I is High. Availability is not mentioned, so A is None. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.29999999999999893, "success": true}

First, I need to go through the CVE description and figure out each metric based on the given options.\n\nThe CVE description says the vulnerability is in D-Link DI-7003GV2, and it's classified as critical. The function affected is sub_497DE4 in /H5/netconfig.asp. The issue is improper authentication, and the attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit is public.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV): The description mentions the attack can be initiated remotely. That usually means Network (N), since it's over a network without needing physical access. So AV is N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability allows for improper authentication. If it's a simple exploit, like not requiring complex steps, then AC is Low (L). Since it's a remote attack and the exploit is public, it's likely low complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is due to improper authentication. If the attacker doesn't need any prior authentication, then PR is None (N). But wait, if the attack requires some level of authentication, maybe Low. However, the description says \"improper authentication\" which might mean that the attacker can bypass authentication, so they don't need privileges. So PR is N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack is initiated remotely, and the description doesn't mention needing user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the device's own code, so the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects the same component, it's unchanged. If it's in a different component, maybe changed. But here, it's the device's own function, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability is improper authentication. If authentication is bypassed, the attacker can access resources they shouldn't, leading to confidentiality issues. Also, they might be able to modify data (integrity) or cause denial of service (availability). But the description doesn't specify all three. However, since it's a critical vulnerability and improper authentication often leads to unauthorized access, which affects confidentiality. But maybe also integrity if they can modify data. However, the description doesn't mention availability. The original CVE says it's critical, so maybe all three are high. But I need to be careful. Let me think again.\n\nThe vulnerability allows the attacker to bypass authentication, which would allow them to access confidential data (C: H), modify data (I: H), and possibly disrupt services (A: H). But the description doesn't explicitly mention availability. However, in CVSS, if the vulnerability can lead to any of these, even if not explicitly stated, but the impact is high. Since the vulnerability is critical, it's likely that all three are high. But maybe the original description only mentions confidentiality and integrity. Wait, the problem says the manipulation leads to improper authentication. So the main impact is unauthorized access, which would be confidentiality. But if the attacker can modify data, that's integrity. However, the description doesn't mention availability. So maybe C and I are high, and A is none. But the original CVE is critical, which might imply high impact in all three. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. If the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to data, that's confidentiality. If it allows unauthorized modification, that's integrity. If it allows denial of service, that's availability. Since the description says \"improper authentication\" but doesn't mention availability, maybe A is N. But the original CVE is critical, so maybe the impact is high in all three. Alternatively, maybe the exploit allows the attacker to access the system without authentication, leading to confidentiality and integrity issues. But without more info, I might have to assume that all three are high. However, the problem says to base it on the description. The description says \"improper authentication\" which could lead to unauthorized access (confidentiality), but not necessarily integrity or availability. So maybe C is H, I is N, A is N. But that might not be right. Alternatively, if the attacker can modify data after bypassing authentication, then I is H. But the description doesn't specify. This is a bit ambiguous. However, since the vulnerability is critical, and the exploit is public, it's possible that all three are high. But I need to make a best guess here. Let me check the original CVE description again. It says \"manipulation leads to improper authentication. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely.\" So the main impact is unauthorized access, which would be confidentiality. But maybe the attacker can also modify data (integrity) or cause availability issues. However, without explicit mention, I might have to assume that only confidentiality is affected. But the original CVE is critical, which might imply high impact in all three. Alternatively, maybe the vulnerability allows the attacker to access the system, which could lead to all three. But I think the safest assumption here is that confidentiality is high, and the others are none unless specified. However, the problem says to determine based on the description. Since the description doesn't mention integrity or availability, maybe they are N. But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe the improper authentication allows the attacker to perform actions that could affect integrity or availability. For example, if they can modify configurations, that's integrity. But again, the description doesn't say. This is a bit of a challenge. Let me think again. The original CVE is critical, which in CVSS terms would require high impact in at least one of the three. But the problem is to assign based on the given description. Since the description only mentions improper authentication leading to unauthorized access, I think C is H, and I and A are N. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the attacker can modify data (I: H) if they can access the system. But again, the description doesn't specify. Hmm. Maybe the answer expects all three to be H. But I need to make a decision here. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 guidelines. The impact metrics are based on the potential impact of the vulnerability. If the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to data, that's confidentiality. If it allows unauthorized modification, that's integrity. If it allows denial of service, that's availability. Since the description doesn't mention availability, A is N. For integrity, if the attacker can modify data, then I is H. But the description doesn't say that. So maybe I is N. But the original CVE is critical, which might imply that the impact is high. However, without explicit information, I think the safest is to assign C as H, and I and A as N. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the vulnerability allows the attacker to access the system, which could lead to all three. But again, the description doesn't specify. This is a bit of a problem. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example vector has C, I, A all as H. But that's just an example. The actual answer depends on the description. Since the description says \"improper authentication\" which is a security bypass, leading to unauthorized access, which would be confidentiality. So C is H. The other two might be N unless the description says otherwise. So I'll go with C: H, I: N, A: N. But I'm not 100% confident. Alternatively, maybe the attacker can modify data (I: H) if they can access the system. But again, the description doesn't say. Hmm. Maybe the answer expects all three to be H. But I need to make a choice based on the given info. Let's proceed with C: H, I: N, A: N. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the vulnerability allows the attacker to perform actions that could affect integrity. For example, if they can change configurations, that's integrity. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think the best approach is to assign C: H, I: N, A: N. But I'm not certain. Let me check the original CVE again. The function is sub_497DE4 in /H5/netconfig.asp. The manipulation leads to improper authentication. So the attacker can bypass authentication, which would allow them to access the system. That would affect confidentiality (they can access data they shouldn't), but not necessarily integrity or availability. So I think C is H, I and A are N. So the metrics would be:\n\nAV: N (remote attack)\nAC: L (low complexity)\nPR: N (no privileges needed)\nUI: N (no user interaction)\nS: U (unchanged)\nC: H\nI: N\nA: N\n\nBut wait, the original CVE is critical, which might require higher impact. However, the CVSS base score is calculated based on the metrics. If C is H and others are N, the base score would be higher. Let me check the CVSS calculator. For example, with AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. The base score would be calculated as follows:\n\nThe formula for CVSS v3.1 base score is:\n\nBase Score = (Attack Vector (AV) + Attack Complexity (AC) + Privileges Required (PR) + User Interaction (UI)) * (Confidentiality (C) + Integrity (I) + Availability (A)).\n\nBut the exact calculation is more complex. However, the main point here is to assign the metrics correctly. Given the description, I think the correct assignment is as above. So the vector string would be:\n\nAV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n\nBut I'm not sure about the", "prediction": "", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

Only agents should be able to see and work on shared article drafts. However, a logged in customer was able to see details about shared drafts for their customer tickets in the browser console, which may contain confidential information, and also to manipulate them via API.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in Zammad 6.4.x before 6.4.2, where there's an information exposure. The issue is that logged-in customers can see shared article drafts in the browser console and manipulate them via API. These drafts are supposed to be accessible only to agents.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability allows access via the browser console and API, which are network-based. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is about how complex the attack is. Since the attacker just needs to be logged in as a customer and access the console or use the API, which doesn't require complex steps, AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) refers to the level of access needed. The attacker needs to be a logged-in customer, which is a user with some privileges, but not high. However, in CVSS, if the attacker needs to be authenticated but not with high privileges, it's considered Low (L). Wait, but the description says \"a logged in customer\" which might imply that the attacker needs to have a valid user account. But the PR metric for CVSS v3.1 considers whether the attacker needs privileges. If the user is authenticated but doesn't need elevated privileges, it's Low. However, if the user is a regular user, maybe it's considered as Low. Alternatively, if the system requires authentication, but the user is already authenticated, then PR is Low. So I think PR is Low (L) here.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is whether the attack requires user interaction. The vulnerability is exploited via the browser console, which the user would have to interact with. However, the description says that the customer can see the details in the console, which might be a passive exposure. But if the user has to click on something or interact, then UI is Required (R). However, if the information is exposed automatically when the user is logged in, maybe UI is None (N). Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The vulnerability allows the customer to see the details in the browser console. If the user is already logged in, and the information is exposed without any further action, then UI is None. But if the user has to open the console and look for it, that's user interaction. However, in CVSS, UI is considered as whether the attack requires the user to perform an action. Since the exposure is automatic upon being logged in, maybe UI is None. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the user has to interact with the console, which is a user action, then UI is Required. I think in this case, since the user is already authenticated and the information is exposed in the console, which the user can access, it's a case where user interaction is required. Wait, but the user is already logged in, so maybe the attack doesn't require any additional interaction beyond being logged in. So UI could be None. I need to check the CVSS guidelines. According to NIST, UI is 'None' if the attack can be initiated without any user interaction, and 'Required' if the user must perform an action. Since the user is already logged in and the information is exposed in the console, which the user can access, maybe UI is None. But if the user has to open the console, that's an action. However, the console is part of the browser, so maybe that's considered part of the attack vector. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The vulnerability allows the customer to see the details in the browser console. If the user is logged in, they can access the console, which is a user action. Therefore, UI is Required (R). But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is UI: None because the exposure is automatic once the user is logged in. Hmm. I'll go with UI: None (N) because the user doesn't need to perform any additional steps beyond being logged in. The information is exposed automatically.\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). Since the vulnerability is in the same application (Zammad) and the attack is within the same scope, S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C) is High (H) because the exposure of confidential information (shared drafts) is a high impact on confidentiality.\n\nIntegrity (I) is High (H) because the attacker can manipulate the drafts via API, which affects the integrity of the data.\n\nAvailability (A) is None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't impact the availability of the system; it's about information exposure and manipulation, not making the system unavailable.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low) – because the attacker needs to be a logged-in customer, which requires some privileges but not high.\nUI: N (None) – because the exposure is automatic once logged in.\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but earlier I was confused about PR. Let me check again. The PR metric: if the attacker needs to be authenticated, but not with high privileges, then PR is Low. Since the customer is a regular user, not requiring high privileges, PR is Low. So PR: L. UI: N or R? If the user has to open the console, which is a user action, then UI is Required. But the description says \"a logged in customer was able to see details... in the browser console\". If the user is already logged in, and the information is exposed in the console, which they can access, then maybe UI is None. However, the console is part of the browser, so accessing it might be considered user interaction. But in CVSS, UI is about whether the attack requires the user to perform an action. If the user is already authenticated and the information is exposed without any further action, then UI is None. But if the user has to interact with the console, then it's Required. This is a bit ambiguous. However, in many cases, if the vulnerability is triggered by the user's own actions (like viewing the console), it's considered as requiring user interaction. But I'm not sure. Let me check the CVSS 3.1 guidelines. According to the CVSS documentation, User Interaction is 'None' if the attack can be initiated without any user interaction, and 'Required' if the user must perform an action. In this case, the user is already logged in, and the information is exposed in the console. The user would have to open the console, which is an action. Therefore, UI is Required (R). But I'm not entirely certain. If the user is already authenticated, and the information is automatically exposed, then maybe UI is None. However, the console is a user interface, so accessing it is a user action. Therefore, UI: R. But this is a point of contention. If I choose UI: R, then the vector would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. However, if UI is None, then it's AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Which is correct? Let me think again. The vulnerability allows the customer to see the details in the browser console. The user is already logged in, so the attack doesn't require any additional steps beyond being logged in. The exposure is automatic. Therefore, UI is None. Because the user doesn't need to perform any action beyond being logged in. The console is part of the browser, but the information is exposed as part of the application's response. Therefore, UI: None. So I'll go with UI: N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

While 1.15.1 introduced a fix to restrict untrusted packages, the default setting of trusted packages still allows malicious classes from these packages to be executed. The exploit is only applicable if the client code of parquet-avro uses the \"specific\" or the \"reflect\" models deliberately for reading Parquet files. (\"generic\" model is not impacted) Users are recommended to upgrade to 1.15.2 or set the system property \"org.apache.parquet.avro.SERIALIZABLE_PACKAGES\" to an empty string on 1.15.1. Both are sufficient to fix the issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the parquet-avro module of Apache Parquet versions up to 1.15.0. The issue is that schema parsing allows arbitrary code execution. The fix in 1.15.1 restricts untrusted packages, but the default setting still allows malicious classes from those packages to be executed. The exploit requires the client code to use the \"specific\" or \"reflect\" models when reading Parquet files, and the \"generic\" model isn't affected.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The description mentions that the exploit is applicable if the client code uses certain models. Since it's about parsing data, which is typically done over a network (like reading files from a network location), but the vulnerability might be triggered by local code execution. However, the exploit requires the client to use specific models, which might be part of the application's processing. But since the vulnerability is in the library, and the attack could be via a malicious file, maybe the attack vector is Network (N) if the file is received over the network. However, if the file is local, then it's Local (L). But the description doesn't specify whether the file is from a network or local. Hmm. Wait, the exploit is applicable if the client code uses the models, which could be in a local application. But the vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution, which could be triggered by a malicious file. So, if the file is read from a local system, then AV is Local. But if the file is received from a network, then AV is Network. The description doesn't specify, but since it's a parsing vulnerability, it's possible that the attack vector is Network if the file is sent over the network. However, without explicit mention, maybe it's safer to assume Local (L) because the code is being executed on the local system. Wait, but the CVSS guidelines for AV: if the attack can be initiated remotely, it's Network. If it's through a local file, it's Local. Since the exploit requires the client to use the specific models, which are part of the application's processing, maybe the attack vector is Local. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS guidelines again. The AV metric is based on the path the attacker takes to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without being on the same network, like through a local file, then it's Local. If the attacker can exploit it over the network, like through a web request, then it's Network. Since the vulnerability is in the parsing of a Parquet file, which could be a local file or a file received over the network. The description doesn't specify, but the fact that the exploit is applicable if the client code uses the models suggests that the attacker would have to provide a malicious file. If the file is from a network source, then AV is Network. If it's a local file, then AV is Local. Since the description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is in the library, which is used by applications, it's possible that the attack vector is Network. However, without explicit mention, maybe the default is Network. Alternatively, if the attacker needs to have the file on the local system, then AV is Local. I think I need to make an educated guess here. Since the vulnerability is in the parsing of a file, which could be from a network or local, but the exploit requires the client to use the models, which might be part of the application's processing. If the file is from a network, then AV is Network. If it's a local file, then AV is Local. Since the description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is in the library, which is used by applications, I think the attack vector is Network. Wait, but the exploit is only applicable if the client code uses the specific models. So the attacker would have to get the client to process a malicious file. If the file is sent over the network, then AV is Network. If the file is local, then AV is Local. Since the description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is in the library, which is used by applications, I think the attack vector is Network. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should go with Network (N) as the default for such vulnerabilities unless specified otherwise.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says that the exploit is only applicable if the client code uses the \"specific\" or \"reflect\" models. This suggests that the attacker needs to have the client code configured in a certain way. However, the attack complexity is about how complex the attack is. If the attacker can exploit it with low effort, then AC is Low. If it requires specific conditions, maybe High. But the fact that the exploit requires the client to use certain models might mean that the attack is not straightforward. However, the vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution, which is a high-impact issue. But the AC is about the complexity of the attack. If the attacker can create a malicious file that, when parsed by the client using the specific models, triggers the code execution, then the attack might be considered Low. Because the attacker just needs to create a malicious file. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The description says that the default setting allows malicious classes to be executed. This implies that no special privileges are needed. The attacker doesn't need to have elevated privileges on the system. The vulnerability is in the library, and if the client code is using the specific models, then the attacker can exploit it without needing any additional privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The exploit requires the client code to use the specific models. If the user has to interact with the malicious file, like opening it, then UI is Required (R). However, if the exploit can be triggered automatically without user interaction, then UI is None (N). The description says that the exploit is applicable if the client code uses the models. If the client code is processing a file that the user has provided, then user interaction is required. For example, the user might open a malicious Parquet file, which is then parsed by the application. Therefore, UI is Required (R). But wait, the description doesn't explicitly mention user interaction. It just says that the exploit is applicable if the client code uses the models. If the client code is processing a file that the user has given it, then user interaction is required. However, if the application is processing files automatically without user input, then UI might be None. But the description doesn't specify. This is a bit ambiguous. However, in many cases, if the exploit requires the user to open a file, then UI is Required. Since the vulnerability is in the parsing of a file, which is typically done by the user, I think UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). Since the vulnerability is in the parquet-avro module, which is part of the Apache Parquet library, and the exploit is within the same component, the scope is Unchanged (U). Unless the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component, but the description doesn't mention that. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution, which can lead to complete compromise of the system. Therefore, all three impact metrics (C, I, A) are High (H). Because arbitrary code execution can lead to unauthorized access (C), data modification (I), and denial of service (A).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Network (N) – because the exploit could be via a malicious file received over the network.\nAC: Low (L) – the attack is straightforward once the file is processed.\nPR: None (N) – no privileges needed.\nUI: Required (R) – user must interact with the malicious file.\nS: Unchanged (U) – the vulnerability is within the same component.\nC: High (H) – arbitrary code execution allows access to confidential data.\nI: High (H) – arbitrary code can modify data.\nA: High (H) – arbitrary code can cause denial of service.\n\nWait, but earlier I was considering AV as Network (N) or Local (L). Let me recheck. If the attack vector is through a file that the user opens, then it's Local (L) because the file is on the local system. However, if the file is received from a network, then it's Network (N). The description doesn't specify, but the fact that the exploit is applicable if the client code uses the models suggests that the attacker needs to get the client to process a malicious file. If the file is from a network, then AV is Network. If it's a local file, then AV is Local. Since the description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is in the library, which is used by applications, I think the attack vector is Network (N) because the attacker could send a malicious file over the network, and the client processes it. However, if the file is stored locally, then AV is Local. But without explicit mention, it's safer to assume that the attack vector is Network (N) because the exploit could be triggered by a remote attacker sending a malicious file. Alternatively, if the file is local, then AV is Local. This is a bit of a gray area. However, in many cases, parsing vulnerabilities that require the user to open a file are considered Local (L) because the file is on the local system. But if the file is received from a network, then it's Network.

Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /app-api/infra/file/upload of the component Front-End Store Interface. The manipulation of the argument path leads to path traversal. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the zhijiantianya ruoyi-vue-pro 2.4.1, specifically in the /app-api/infra/file/upload endpoint of the Front-End Store Interface. The issue is a path traversal vulnerability caused by manipulating the 'path' argument. The attack can be launched remotely, and the exploit is public. The vendor didn't respond.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attack can be launched remotely, so that's Network (N). \n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. Path traversal usually requires specific input manipulation, but if it's a simple parameter change, maybe Low (L). Since the exploit is public, it's likely straightforward, so AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability is in a file upload endpoint. If the attacker doesn't need any special privileges to exploit it, then PR is None (N). But wait, maybe the attacker needs to have some access to the system? However, the description says it's a remote attack, so probably no privileges needed. So PR is N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The attack is remote and doesn't require user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the component's functionality, but since it's a remote attack and the component is part of the system, the scope is Unchanged (U). Unless the vulnerability allows access to other components, but the description doesn't mention that. So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A). The vulnerability is path traversal, which can lead to reading or writing files. If the attacker can traverse paths, they might access sensitive files (C: High), modify files (I: High), or cause denial of service by overwriting files (A: High). But the description doesn't specify which of these is affected. However, path traversal typically allows reading files, which affects confidentiality. But if the upload is allowed, maybe the attacker can overwrite files, affecting integrity and availability. Since the exploit is public and the vulnerability is critical, it's likely that all three are high. But I need to be careful. The original description says \"manipulation of the argument path leads to path traversal.\" So the attacker can access files outside the intended directory, which would be a confidentiality issue (C: H). If they can overwrite files, that's integrity (I: H). If the server crashes due to invalid paths, that's availability (A: H). But the description doesn't explicitly mention all three. However, since the vulnerability is critical and the exploit is public, it's safe to assume that all three are high. But maybe the main impact is confidentiality. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the vulnerability allows reading files, which is C: H, but I and A might be N or L. Wait, the CVSS guidelines say that if the vulnerability allows access to data, then C is H. If it allows modification, I is H. If it causes a denial of service, A is H. Since the vulnerability is path traversal, which is typically about accessing files, so C is H. But if the attacker can upload files to arbitrary paths, that could allow overwriting existing files (I: H) or cause the server to crash (A: H). However, the description doesn't specify. But given that the vulnerability is critical and the exploit is public, it's possible that all three are high. But I need to check the CVSS guidelines again. The base score calculation for C, I, A is based on whether the vulnerability can impact those aspects. If the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to data, then C is H. If it allows unauthorized modification, I is H. If it causes a loss of availability, A is H. Since the vulnerability is path traversal, which is typically about accessing files, so C is H. But if the attacker can overwrite files, that's I. If the server is compromised, maybe A is H. But without explicit info, maybe the default is to assume that all three are H. However, the original description doesn't mention availability or integrity, only confidentiality. But the CVSS might require that if the vulnerability can lead to any of these, even if not explicitly stated. Alternatively, maybe the vulnerability is only about confidentiality. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The path traversal allows the attacker to access files outside the intended directory. That's a confidentiality issue. If the attacker can upload files to arbitrary paths, that's integrity. But the description says the attack is on the upload endpoint. So maybe the attacker can upload files to any path, which could overwrite existing files (I: H) or cause the server to crash (A: H). But again, the description doesn't specify. However, since the vulnerability is critical, it's possible that all three are high. But I need to make a best guess here. Maybe the main impact is confidentiality, so C: H, and I and A: N. But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to read or write files, then both C and I are H. But the description doesn't specify. This is a bit ambiguous. However, in the absence of specific information, I might have to assume that the vulnerability affects confidentiality (C: H) and maybe integrity (I: H) if the attacker can overwrite files. Availability (A) might be N unless the server crashes. But without explicit info, maybe A is N. But the original CVE says it's critical, so maybe all three are H. I think I need to go with C: H, I: H, A: H. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the vulnerability only affects confidentiality. Let me check the CVSS guidelines again. The CVSS v3.1 base score calculation for confidentiality, integrity, and availability is based on whether the vulnerability can impact each. If the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to data, then C is H. If it allows unauthorized modification, I is H. If it causes a loss of availability, A is H. Since the vulnerability is path traversal, which is typically about accessing files, so C is H. If the attacker can overwrite files, that's I. If the server is compromised, maybe A. But without explicit info, maybe the best is to assume C: H, I: H, A: H. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the vulnerability only affects confidentiality. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let me proceed with C: H, I: H, A: H, given that the vulnerability is critical and the exploit is public, which might imply that all three are affected.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.7000000000000011, "success": true}

A low-privileged attacker could leverage this vulnerability to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized read access. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is an Improper Access Control in Adobe Commerce versions up to certain patches. The key points are that a low-privileged attacker can bypass security measures to gain unauthorized read access, and exploitation doesn't require user interaction.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attacker can exploit this without user interaction, but it doesn't specify if it's over the network, adjacent, local, or physical. However, since it's a web application vulnerability (Adobe Commerce is a web platform), the attack vector is likely Network (N). Unless there's a specific mention of needing local access or physical access, which there isn't, so AV is N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The vulnerability allows a low-privileged attacker to exploit it. If the attack requires complex steps, AC would be High. But the description doesn't mention any complexity; it just says the attacker can leverage the vulnerability. Since it's a bypass of security measures, which might be straightforward once the vulnerability is present, I think AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker is low-privileged, so they don't need high privileges. But the question is, does the attacker need any privileges at all? The description says a low-privileged attacker can exploit it, implying that they already have some level of access. However, if the vulnerability allows bypassing security without needing any prior privileges, then PR would be None (N). Wait, the wording is \"a low-privileged attacker could leverage this vulnerability to bypass security measures\". So the attacker already has low privileges, but the vulnerability allows them to bypass security. So the attack doesn't require additional privileges beyond what they already have. Therefore, PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to elevate their privileges; they just exploit the existing access. Hmm, but maybe PR is Low (L) because they need to have some existing privileges. Wait, the CVSS PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have low privileges to exploit it, then PR is Low. But if the vulnerability can be exploited without any privileges, then PR is None. The description says \"low-privileged attacker could leverage this vulnerability\", which suggests that the attacker already has low privileges. So the attack doesn't require additional privileges beyond that. Therefore, PR is Low (L)? Or is it None? Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have low privileges to exploit it, then PR is Low. If the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, then PR is None. The description says the attacker is low-privileged, but that's their status, not necessarily that the attack requires them to have those privileges. For example, if the vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to exploit it, then PR is None. But if the attacker needs to be authenticated (even with low privileges), then PR is Low. The description says \"low-privileged attacker could leverage this vulnerability\", which implies that the attacker has some level of access. So maybe PR is Low. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. According to CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have some privileges (like being authenticated), then PR is Low or High. If no privileges are needed, it's None. Since the attacker is low-privileged, but the vulnerability allows them to bypass security, perhaps the attack doesn't require additional privileges. So maybe PR is None. Wait, but the attacker is already low-privileged. So the attack doesn't require any additional privileges. Therefore, PR is None. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is PR: Low because the attacker needs to have some existing privileges. I need to make a decision here. Let me think again. If the vulnerability is in a part of the system that requires authentication, then the attacker needs to be authenticated (low privileges) to exploit it. So PR would be Low. If the vulnerability is in a part that doesn't require authentication, then PR is None. The description doesn't specify, but since it's a security feature bypass, it's likely that the attacker needs to be authenticated to some extent. Therefore, PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is stated as \"Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.\" So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). Since the vulnerability is in Adobe Commerce itself, and the attack is within the same system, the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. The vulnerability allows unauthorized read access, so Confidentiality is High (H) because the attacker can read data they shouldn't. Integrity and Availability aren't mentioned, so they are None (N). Wait, the description says \"gain unauthorized read access\", which affects confidentiality. There's no mention of modifying data (integrity) or disrupting availability. So C is H, I and A are N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None) or L (Low)? Earlier confusion here. Let me recheck. If the attacker needs to be authenticated (low privileges) to exploit the vulnerability, then PR is Low. If the attack can be done without authentication, then PR is None. The description says \"low-privileged attacker could leverage this vulnerability\", which suggests that the attacker already has some level of access. So the attack requires that the attacker has low privileges, which they already have. Therefore, PR is Low (L). Because the attacker needs to have those privileges to exploit the vulnerability. So PR is Low.\n\nWait, but according to CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated (even with low privileges), then PR is Low. If the attacker can exploit it without any authentication, then PR is None. The description doesn't say whether authentication is required. However, since it's a security feature bypass, it's possible that the attacker is already authenticated (low-privileged) and then bypasses the security. Therefore, PR is Low. So I think PR is Low (L).\n\nSo the metrics would be:\n\nAV: N\nAC: L\nPR: L\nUI: N\nS: U\nC: H\nI: N\nA: N\n\nNow, constructing the vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n\nWait, but earlier I thought PR might be N. Let me check again. If the attacker is low-privileged, but the vulnerability allows them to bypass security, does that mean they need to have those privileges to exploit it? For example, if the vulnerability is in a part of the system that requires authentication, then the attacker must be authenticated (low-privileged) to exploit it. Therefore, PR is Low. If the vulnerability is in a part that doesn't require authentication, then PR is None. Since the description doesn't specify, but it's a security feature bypass, it's likely that the attacker is already authenticated. Therefore, PR is Low. So the answer would be PR:L.\n\nBut I'm still a bit uncertain. Let me check the CVSS PR definitions again. PR: None means no privileges are required. Low means the attacker needs to have some level of privileges (like being authenticated). High means the attacker needs administrative privileges. Since the attacker is low-privileged, but the attack requires that they have those privileges, PR is Low. So yes, PR:L.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Despite CSRF protection preventing file uploads, the application still processes multipart boundaries, leading to resource exhaustion. By appending additional characters to the multipart boundary, an attacker can cause the server to parse each byte of the boundary, ultimately leading to service unavailability. This vulnerability is present in the `/upload_avatar`, `/upload_app`, and `/upload_logo` endpoints.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS) in the file upload endpoints of the lollms-webui application. It's exploitable via CSRF, even though CSRF protection is in place, but the server still processes multipart boundaries, leading to resource exhaustion. The attacker can append characters to the multipart boundary, causing the server to parse each byte, leading to service unavailability. The affected endpoints are /upload_avatar, /upload_app, and /upload_logo.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via CSRF. CSRF typically involves an attacker tricking a user into making a request, which would be over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says that the attacker can exploit this by appending additional characters to the multipart boundary. This seems like a low complexity attack because it's a specific manipulation of the request, not requiring complex steps. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the file upload endpoints. However, the CSRF protection is supposed to prevent file uploads, but the server still processes the multipart boundaries. Since the attacker doesn't need any special privileges beyond what a regular user has (assuming the user is authenticated, but the CSRF protection is bypassed), but the description doesn't mention needing elevated privileges. Wait, CSRF usually requires the user to be authenticated. So the attacker needs the user to be authenticated, but the attack doesn't require the attacker to have any privileges themselves. So PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any privileges beyond the user's session. Wait, but if the user is authenticated, then the attacker is using the user's privileges. However, in CVSS, PR is about the privileges required by the attacker, not the user. Since the attacker doesn't need to have any special privileges themselves, just that the user is authenticated. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack is via CSRF, which requires the user to interact with a malicious link or site. So UI is Required (R). Because the user has to be tricked into clicking a link, which is user interaction.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component that's being attacked. Since the endpoints are part of the application, and the attack doesn't change the scope (i.e., it's not affecting a different component or system), S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability is a DoS, so it doesn't impact confidentiality. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the DoS doesn't affect data integrity. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability leads to service unavailability, so A is High (H). Because the attack results in the service being unavailable, which is a high impact on availability.\n\nWait, but the CVSS v3.1 metrics for availability: High (H) means the attack results in a complete loss of availability, while Low (L) is partial. Since the DoS here is causing service unavailability, which is a complete loss, so A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the UI is Required. Since CSRF requires the user to interact (click a link, etc.), so UI is Required. That's correct.\n\nAnother point: the Scope (S) is Unchanged because the vulnerability is in the same component. If the attack affected a different component, it would be Changed. But here, the attack is on the same application's endpoints, so S is U.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the final vector string is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

User interaction is required for triggering this vulnerability.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to parse the CVE description carefully. The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write in decoding frame buffer in libsthmbc.so before a specific release. It allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code with privilege, and user interaction is required to trigger it.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description says \"local attackers,\" so that's Local (L). But wait, sometimes \"local\" can be confused with Adjacent (A) if it's on the same network. However, the term \"local\" here likely refers to the same system, so AV should be L.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, which typically requires specific conditions. But the description doesn't mention high complexity. Since it's a buffer overflow, maybe it's Low (L) because it's a straightforward exploit once the condition is met. But I need to be careful. If the exploit requires precise conditions, maybe High. However, the CVE says \"allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code,\" which might imply that once the vulnerability is triggered, the exploit is straightforward. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attackers need to have local access. Since it's a local vulnerability, the attacker might need some privileges. Wait, the description says \"execute arbitrary code with privilege.\" Wait, does that mean the attacker needs privileges to exploit it, or that the exploit results in code execution with privileges? The wording is a bit ambiguous. If the attacker is local, maybe they already have some level of access. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is in a library that's used by a process that runs with high privileges, then the attacker might not need any privileges to exploit it. Wait, the description says \"execute arbitrary code with privilege,\" which might mean that the code runs with elevated privileges. So the attacker doesn't need to have privileges themselves; the vulnerability allows them to run code with higher privileges. Therefore, PR would be None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any prior privileges to exploit it. Hmm, but if the attacker is local, maybe they already have some access. Wait, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is in a system component that's accessible without any user privileges, then PR is None. For example, if a local user can trigger the vulnerability without needing any special permissions, then PR is N. But if the attacker needs to have certain privileges to access the system component, then PR would be Low or High. The description says \"local attackers,\" which might imply that they have some level of access, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is in a library that's used by a service that runs with high privileges, then the attacker might not need any privileges to trigger the vulnerability. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description states \"user interaction is required for triggering this vulnerability.\" So UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in a library (libsthmbc.so), which is part of the system. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect the same component (the library), then the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects a different component, then it's Changed (C). Since the exploit is within the same system and the same component, S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code with privilege.

Prior to version 1.8.179, there is no check to ensure that the user is disabling notifications for the mailbox to which they already have access. Moreover, the code explicitly implements functionality that if the user does not have access to the mailbox, then after disabling (enabling) notifications for this mailbox, the user will gain access to it. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.179.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability in FreeScout allows a user to gain access to a mailbox they don't have access to by disabling or enabling notifications for it. The issue is that there's no check to ensure the user is disabling notifications for a mailbox they already have access to. If they don't have access, enabling/disabling notifications grants them access.\n\nSo, the main points here are that the user can exploit this by manipulating notification settings, which then gives them access. Let's break down each metric step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is exploited through the application's interface, which is accessible over the network. Since the user doesn't need to be physically present or adjacent, AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The attack seems straightforward. The user just needs to perform an action (disable/enable notifications) without needing complex steps. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user doesn't need any special privileges. They just need to be a regular user who can access the mailbox's notification settings. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The user has to interact with the application to enable/disable notifications. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but the description says that if the user doesn't have access, they can gain it by doing this. So the attack requires the user to perform an action, hence UI is Required.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the mailbox access) that the user is interacting with. Since the scope isn't changed (it's within the same application's context), S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The user gains access to a mailbox they shouldn't have, which implies they can access confidential information. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The user can modify the mailbox's notification settings, which might affect the integrity of the data. However, the main impact here is access, not data modification. But since the vulnerability allows unauthorized access, which could lead to data manipulation, maybe I is High. Wait, but the description doesn't mention integrity impact. Hmm. The user gains access, which could lead to reading or modifying data. But the primary impact is confidentiality. However, the CVSS metrics might require considering if the vulnerability allows modification. Since the user can enable/disable notifications, which might be a form of altering the system's state, maybe I is High. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the integrity impact is not directly mentioned, maybe it's Low or None. Wait, the problem says that the user gains access to the mailbox. So the main impact is confidentiality (they can read messages) and maybe availability (if they can delete or alter messages). But the description doesn't mention availability. So maybe I is Low or None. Wait, the CVSS guidelines say that if the vulnerability allows unauthorized modification of data, then I is High. Here, the user can enable/disable notifications, which might be a configuration change, but not necessarily data modification. So maybe I is Low or None. But the user can gain access, which could allow them to read or modify data. However, the description doesn't specify that. So perhaps I is Low. Alternatively, since the user can gain access, which could lead to integrity issues, but without explicit mention, maybe I is Low. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me check the CVSS guidelines again. The Integrity impact is High if the vulnerability allows unauthorized modification of data. If the user can access the mailbox, they might be able to read or modify data, but the vulnerability itself is about gaining access, not directly modifying data. So maybe I is Low. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, since the user can change the notification settings, which is a configuration change, that might be considered a low integrity impact. So I'll go with Low (L) for Integrity.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't mention any impact on availability. The user gains access but doesn't cause the system to be unavailable. So A is None (N).\n\nWait, but the user can gain access to the mailbox, which might allow them to delete messages or perform actions that affect availability. However, the description doesn't mention that. So unless the vulnerability directly affects availability, A is None. So I think A is None.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: L (Low) or maybe H? Wait, if the user can access the mailbox, they can read messages (confidentiality) and maybe modify them (integrity). But the description doesn't specify that. The vulnerability is about gaining access, not about modifying data. So maybe I is Low. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The user can enable/disable notifications, which is a configuration change. That's a low integrity impact. So I would say I is Low (L).\n\nWait, but the CVSS 3.1 guidelines for Integrity: High if the vulnerability allows unauthorized modification of data. If the user can access the mailbox, they can read messages (confidentiality) and maybe modify them (integrity). However, the vulnerability itself is about gaining access, not directly modifying data. So unless the vulnerability allows modification, I would say I is Low. But maybe the act of enabling/disabling notifications could be considered a modification. However, that's part of the system's functionality. So perhaps I is Low. Alternatively, if the user can change the notification settings, which is a configuration change, that's a low impact on integrity. So I think I is Low (L).\n\nSo the final metrics would be:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:L, A:N.\n\nWait, but the user can gain access to the mailbox, which allows them to read messages (confidentiality) and possibly modify them (integrity). However, the description doesn't mention that the user can modify data, only that they can access it. So maybe I is Low. But if the user can access the mailbox, they can read messages, which is confidentiality, but not necessarily integrity. So I think I is Low. Availability is None.\n\nSo the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N\n\nWait, but earlier I thought UI was Required. Let me check again. The user has to interact with the application to enable/disable notifications. So UI is Required (R). Yes.\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "score": 1.0, "success": true}

The vulnerable sockets were set to listen on all network interfaces, increasing the likelihood that an attacker is able to reach the vulnerable ZeroMQ sockets to carry out an attack. vLLM instances that do not make use of the mooncake integration are not vulnerable. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in vLLM versions from 0.6.5 up to 0.8.5, but only when integrated with mooncake. The issue is that they use pickle-based serialization over unsecured ZeroMQ sockets that listen on all network interfaces, allowing remote code execution (RCE). The fix is in 0.8.5.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is exploitable over the network because the ZeroMQ sockets are listening on all network interfaces. So AV should be Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description mentions that the attacker can reach the vulnerable sockets, but does it require any specific steps? Since it's using pickle over ZeroMQ, which is a common protocol, maybe the attack is straightforward. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability allows remote code execution without needing any prior authentication or privileges. The attacker doesn't need to have any special privileges on the system. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack doesn't require any user interaction. The attacker can exploit it remotely without the user doing anything. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the same component (vLLM) that's being attacked. Since the attack is on the server-side component and doesn't affect other components, the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the attack leads to code execution in the same process, maybe it's unchanged. If it's a different component, maybe changed. But the description says it's a remote code execution in the vLLM instance, so the scope is unchanged. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows remote code execution, which can lead to full access to the system, so confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, RCE can modify data or the system, so integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The attack could potentially cause a denial of service, but the main issue is RCE. However, the CVSS metrics for availability are based on whether the vulnerability can cause a loss of availability. Since the description doesn't mention DoS, but RCE, maybe A is High (H) because the attacker could execute arbitrary code, which might affect availability. Wait, but the CVSS v3.1 availability metric is about the impact on availability. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a system crash or resource exhaustion, then A is High. However, the description doesn't specify that. But since it's RCE, the attacker could potentially cause the service to stop, but maybe that's not certain. Hmm. Alternatively, if the vulnerability doesn't directly impact availability, then A might be None (N). But the original CVSS for RCE usually has A as High because the attacker can execute code, which could lead to availability issues. Wait, but the CVSS v3.1 availability metric is about whether the vulnerability can cause a loss of availability. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code, that could lead to availability issues (like crashing the service), but it's not guaranteed. However, in the absence of specific information, the default for RCE is that it can lead to high impact on availability. So I think A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: H (High)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to go through the CVE description and figure out each metric based on the given options.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attack can be initiated remotely. That usually means Network (N), since it's not local or physical. So AV is N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The vulnerability is a path traversal via a parameter, which might be considered low complexity. Exploiting it doesn't require complex steps, so AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) – the attack is initiated remotely, and there's no mention of needing any user privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) – the exploit doesn't require user interaction. The attack is remote and automated, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) – the vulnerability is in the server's function, so the scope is unchanged (U). It doesn't affect other components beyond the original scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) – path traversal can lead to unauthorized access to files (C: High), modifying files (I: High), and potentially causing denial of service if the server is overwhelmed (A: High). But wait, the description doesn't mention availability impact. Hmm. The vulnerability is path traversal, which typically affects confidentiality and integrity. Availability might not be impacted unless the attack leads to server crashes, which isn't stated here. So maybe A is None (N). But I need to check. The original description says the exploit has been disclosed and may be used. If the attack allows reading or writing files, that's C and I. Availability isn't mentioned, so A is N. But I'm a bit unsure here. Let me think again. Path traversal usually allows reading files, which is confidentiality. If the attacker can write, that's integrity. But the description doesn't specify if the attack allows writing. It just says manipulation of the filename leads to path traversal. So maybe only confidentiality is affected. But the problem says \"the manipulation of the argument filename leads to path traversal.\" That could allow reading files, so C is High. Integrity might not be affected unless the attack allows writing. Since the description doesn't mention that, I think I is N. Wait, but the options are N, L, H. If the vulnerability allows access to files, that's a high impact on confidentiality. For integrity, if the attack can modify files, then H. But the description doesn't say that. So maybe I is N. Availability is also N unless the attack causes the service to stop. So C is H, I is N, A is N. Wait, but the original problem says the exploit has been disclosed and may be used. But the actual impact isn't specified. Hmm. Maybe I should check standard CVSS for path traversal. Typically, path traversal vulnerabilities are rated with C:H, I:N, A:N unless they can cause denial of service. So I think C is H, I is N, A is N. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the attack can overwrite files, then I is H. But the description doesn't mention that. So I'll go with C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but the user interaction is None because the attack is initiated remotely without user interaction. That's correct. So the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But I need to confirm the impact metrics again. If the vulnerability allows reading files, that's confidentiality. If it allows writing, that's integrity. Since the description says \"manipulation of the argument filename leads to path traversal,\" which is typically reading, so C:H. If the attack can't modify files, then I:N. Availability is not mentioned, so A:N. So the final vector is AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But I'm a bit confused about the integrity. Maybe the answer expects I:H? Let me check again. The vulnerability is in the downloadSoftware function. If the attacker can traverse paths, they might be able to download arbitrary files, which affects confidentiality. If they can upload, that's integrity. But the function is for downloading, so maybe only C is affected. So I think C:H, I:N, A:N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

This makes the server susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.3.0.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in WeGIA, a web manager for charitable institutions. The issue is that the server allows excessively long HTTP GET requests to a specific URL due to insufficient validation of the 'fid' parameter's length. This leads to high resource consumption, latency, timeouts, and read errors, making it a DoS vulnerability. The fix is in version 3.3.0.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP GET requests. Since HTTP is a network protocol, the attack can be initiated remotely over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says that the server processes URLs up to 8,142 characters. To exploit this, an attacker just needs to send a long GET request. There's no need for complex steps or specific conditions. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the server's handling of HTTP requests. An attacker doesn't need any special privileges; they just need to send a malicious request. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack doesn't require any user interaction. The attacker can send the request directly without needing a user to click on a link or interact. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the server itself, which is part of the same component. Since the attack doesn't change the scope (i.e., it's not affecting a different component or system), S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability leads to DoS, which doesn't directly impact confidentiality. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the DoS doesn't affect the integrity of the data. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The main impact is on availability, causing the server to be unavailable due to resource exhaustion. So A is High (H).\n\nWait, but the problem says the server is susceptible to DoS attacks. So the availability is definitely impacted. But the other metrics: confidentiality and integrity are not mentioned. So C and I are N. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N, AC: L, PR: N, UI: N, S: U, C: N, I: N, A: H.\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but the user said to check each metric. Let me double-check.\n\nAttack Vector: Network (N) because it's a web server, so remote access.\n\nAttack Complexity: Low because it's a simple request with a long parameter, no complex steps.\n\nPrivileges Required: None, as no authentication is needed.\n\nUser Interaction: None, since the attack can be done without user interaction.\n\nScope: Unchanged because the vulnerability is in the same component (server) that's being attacked.\n\nConfidentiality: No impact, so N.\n\nIntegrity: No impact, so N.\n\nAvailability: High impact because it's a DoS, which is a high availability impact.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

A low-privileged attacker can modify data without user interaction.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability allows a low-privileged attacker to exploit it.

They can exploit it over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The description mentions it's a low-privileged attacker, which might imply that the attack is straightforward.

So the attacker already has low privileges, but the vulnerability allows them to do something they shouldn't. So the PR is Low (L) because they need low privileges to exploit it.

But if the vulnerability allows an attacker without any privileges to exploit it, then PR would be None. But the description says \"low-privileged attacker\", so they need to have that privilege. Therefore, PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is mentioned as \"does not require user interaction\", so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. Since it's a security feature bypass in the same application, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects a different component, it would be Changed. But here, it's within the same system, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. The vulnerability allows modifying select data, which affects Integrity. The description says \"security feature bypass\", which could lead to unauthorized data modification. So Integrity is High (H). Confidentiality might not be directly affected unless data is accessed, but the description doesn't mention that. So C is None (N). Availability isn't mentioned, so A is None (N). Wait, but the vulnerability allows modifying data, which is a high impact on Integrity. So I is H. C and A are N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the PR might be N if the attacker doesn't need any privileges. Let me recheck that. The description says \"low-privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability\". So the attacker needs to have low privileges to exploit it. Therefore, PR is Low (L). If the attacker didn't need any privileges, it would be N. But since they need to be low-privileged, PR is L. So the metrics are as above.\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. Wait, but the answer example had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, in the example, the user had a different scenario. Let me check again. The vulnerability allows modifying data, which is a high impact on Integrity. So I is H. Confidentiality isn't mentioned, so C is N. Availability isn't mentioned, so A is N. So the final vector is AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. But wait, the example in the user's message had C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. In this case, the vulnerability allows modifying data, which is a high impact on Integrity. So I is H. But Confidentiality and Availability are not mentioned, so they are N. Therefore, the correct vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.2, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a time-based SQL injection in the Tour Master plugin for WordPress. The attack vector is through the'review_id' parameter, and it's possible for authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access (which is a low privilege) to inject SQL queries to extract sensitive data.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the vulnerability is via a parameter in the plugin, which is accessible over the network. Since it's a web application vulnerability, the attack vector is Network (N). So AV is N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. Time-based SQL injection typically requires some level of skill to craft the payload, but it's not necessarily high complexity. However, the vulnerability is exploitable with a simple parameter manipulation, so maybe Low (L). But wait, time-based SQLi might require precise timing, which could be considered medium. Hmm, but according to CVSS guidelines, if the attack requires some level of skill but not high, it's Low. I think in this case, since it's a parameter that's not properly escaped, the attacker can inject the payload without needing complex steps. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The description says authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access. Subscriber is a low privilege in WordPress. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but the user needs to be authenticated. However, the PR metric considers the level of privileges required. Since Subscriber is a low-level user, PR is Low (L). But wait, the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, does that count as requiring privileges? The PR metric is about the level of privileges needed. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any privileges, it's N. But here, they need to be authenticated, which is a form of privilege. However, Subscriber is a low-level privilege. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is via a parameter in a request. If the attacker can exploit it without needing the user to interact, like through a crafted request, then UI is None (N). But if the user has to click on a link or something, it's Required (R). The description says \"authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above\" can append SQL queries. Since the attacker is authenticated, they can make the request themselves without needing user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component (the plugin) that's being attacked. Since the attack is within the same security boundary, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed (C). Here, it's the same component, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability allows extraction of sensitive information, so Confidentiality is High (H). Integrity is also High (H) because the attacker can modify data. Availability might be High if the attack can cause denial of service, but the description mentions extracting data, not disrupting service. However, SQL injection can sometimes be used to delete data, which would affect availability. But the main impact here is on confidentiality and integrity. The description says \"extract sensitive information,\" so C is H. I is H because the attacker can inject queries to alter data. Availability (A) is None (N) unless the attack can cause the system to be unavailable. Since the description doesn't mention availability impact, A is N.\n\nWait, but the CVSS base metrics for impact are C, I, A. The vulnerability allows data extraction, which is confidentiality. Integrity could be affected if the attacker can modify data. However, the description says \"append additional SQL queries into existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information.\" So the main impact is on confidentiality. But if the attacker can inject queries to modify data, that would affect integrity. However, the description doesn't explicitly mention modifying data, just extracting. So maybe I is Low or None. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The original vulnerability is SQL injection, which can be used for both reading and writing. But the description says \"extract sensitive information,\" which is confidentiality. However, the potential for integrity impact exists. But since the description doesn't mention it, maybe I is Low or None. Wait, the CVSS guidelines state that if the vulnerability can be used to modify data, then I is High. But the description doesn't specify that. So perhaps I is Low or None. Alternatively, since SQL injection can be used to modify data, even if the description doesn't mention it, the potential exists. But the CVSS base score is based on the actual impact, not potential. Since the description only mentions extraction, maybe I is Low or None. However, the default for I is None unless the vulnerability allows modification. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the CVSS guidelines again. The Impact Subscore is calculated based on the maximum of the three (C, I, A). If the vulnerability allows for data extraction (C=H), and the attacker can inject queries to modify data (I=H), but the description doesn't mention that. However, the presence of SQL injection typically allows for both read and write operations. But the description only mentions extraction. So maybe I is Low (L) or None (N). Alternatively, since the attacker can inject arbitrary SQL, they can modify data, so I is High. But the description doesn't state that. This is a point of uncertainty. However, in practice, SQL injection vulnerabilities are often rated with I=H because they can be used to modify data. But the description here only mentions extraction. Hmm. Maybe the correct approach is to use the information given. Since the description says \"extract sensitive information,\" which is confidentiality, but doesn't mention integrity or availability, then I and A would be N. But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, the presence of SQL injection implies that the attacker can modify data, so I=H. But the description doesn't mention that. This is a bit of a dilemma. I think the safest approach is to go with the information given. Since the description only mentions extraction, I would set I to Low (L) or None (N). However, the CVSS guidelines might consider that SQL injection can be used to modify data, so I=H. But without explicit mention, maybe it's safer to assume that the impact is only on confidentiality. Alternatively, the default for I is None unless the vulnerability allows modification. Since the description doesn't mention it, I would set I to None (N). But I'm not sure. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 guidelines again. The Impact Subscore is calculated based on the maximum of the three (C, I, A). If the vulnerability allows for data extraction (C=H), and the attacker can inject queries to modify data (I=H), but the description doesn't mention that. However, the presence of SQL injection typically allows for both. But the description only mentions extraction. So maybe I is Low (L) or None (N). Alternatively, the CVSS might assume that if the vulnerability is a SQL injection, then I is High. But I think the correct approach is to use the information given. Since the description doesn't mention integrity or availability, those would be N. But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, the presence of SQL injection implies that the attacker can modify data, so I=H. But the description doesn't state that. This is a bit of a gray area. I'll proceed with the information given. The description says \"extract sensitive information,\" so C=H. I and A are not mentioned, so they are N. But that might not be correct. Alternatively, since the attacker can inject SQL, they can modify data, so I=H. But the description doesn't say that. Hmm. Maybe the answer is C=H, I=H, A=N. But I'm not sure. Let me check another angle. The CVSS v3.1 Impact Subscore formula is: Impact = 1.0 - [(1 - Confidentiality) * (1 - Integrity) * (1 - Availability)]. If C=H, I=H, A=N, then the Impact is 1.0 - [(1 - 0.59) * (1 - 0.59) * (1 - 0.0)] = 1.0 - [0.41 * 0.41 * 1] = 1 - 0.1681 = 0.8319. If I is N, then Impact is 1.0 - [(1 - 0.59) * (1 - 0.0) * (1 - 0.0)] = 1.0 - [0.41 * 1 * 1] = 0.59. But the actual impact depends on the vulnerability's potential. Since the vulnerability is SQL injection, which can be used to modify data, I should be H. Therefore, I think I=H. So, C=H, I=H, A=N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.7000000000000011, "success": true}

However, there is a gap between this insert and bc link creation, a bc packet may come in and get the node from the hashtable then try to dereference its bc link, which is NULL. This patch is to fix it by moving the bc link creation before inserting into the hashtable. Note that for a preliminary node becoming \"real\", the bc link creation should also be called before it's rehashed, as we don't create it for preliminary nodes.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the vulnerability described in the CVE. The issue is a NULL pointer dereference in the Linux kernel related to the TIPC (Transparent Inter-Process Communication) module. The problem occurs when a node is created, and the bc (broadcast) link is created after inserting the node into a hashtable. If a broadcast packet arrives during this gap, it might access the node's bc link, which is still NULL, leading to a crash.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a NULL pointer dereference, it's likely that an attacker can exploit this remotely. However, the description doesn't mention network access. Wait, TIPC is a communication protocol, so maybe it's network-based. But the vulnerability is in the kernel code handling TIPC packets. If the attack requires sending a specific packet over the network to trigger the crash, then AV would be Network (N). If it's a local exploit, like requiring access to the system, then it would be Local (L). The description mentions that the issue is in the kernel's TIPC module, which is used for inter-process communication, possibly over the network. However, the exploit would require sending a packet that triggers the condition. So I think AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. To exploit this, the attacker would need to send a specific packet that arrives during the window when the node is in the hashtable but the bc link hasn't been created. This might require precise timing or specific conditions. However, if the attack can be triggered with a simple packet, then AC is Low (L). If it's complex, like requiring specific configurations or multiple steps, then High (H). Since the vulnerability is a race condition between inserting the node and creating the bc link, the attacker might need to send a packet at the right time. But in practice, such race conditions can sometimes be exploited with a single packet, so AC is likely Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which typically requires elevated privileges to exploit. However, if the TIPC module is accessible via user-space applications, maybe an unprivileged user could send packets. But the kernel is protected, so usually, such vulnerabilities require root access. However, if the exploit can be triggered via a network packet without needing any user privileges, then PR would be None (N). Wait, but the kernel is running with high privileges. If the attacker can send a packet that triggers the crash, maybe they don't need any privileges. However, in practice, kernel vulnerabilities often require some form of privilege escalation. But in this case, the vulnerability is a crash, which could be exploited via a remote attack. If the attacker can send a packet that causes the kernel to crash, that might be a denial of service, but not necessarily requiring any privileges. However, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, then PR is None (N). If they need to be authenticated or have some access, then it's Low or High. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the attack is via a network packet, I think PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any user privileges to send the packet.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered by a network packet. If the attacker needs the user to interact, like click a link or open a file, then UI is Required (R). But in this case, the attack is automatic once the packet is sent. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component as the TIPC module. Since the vulnerability doesn't affect other components or change the scope, S is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, then it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability is a crash, not a data leak. So Confidentiality impact is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the crash doesn't affect data integrity. So Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability causes a crash, which would make the system unavailable. So Availability is High (H), because the system would be completely unavailable if the kernel crashes.\n\nWait, but the CVSS metrics for Availability: High (H) means that the system is completely unavailable, Low (L) is partial, and None (N) is no impact. Since a kernel crash would cause the system to crash, leading to a complete denial of service, so A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The attacker is local, so AV should be Local (L). The description mentions \"local authenticated attacker,\" which points to a local attack vector.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is about reading data stored in cleartext. Since the attacker just needs to access the stored data, which is already in cleartext, the attack complexity is likely Low (L). No complex steps needed beyond authentication.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs admin privileges, so PR is High (H). The description says \"local authenticated attacker with admin privileges,\" which means high privileges are required.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The attack doesn't require any user interaction beyond the initial authentication. Since the attacker is already authenticated, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component where the data is stored, so the scope is Unchanged (U). There's no indication that the vulnerability affects a different component or changes the scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The attacker can read sensitive data, so Confidentiality is High (H).

First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the bpf_prog_test_run_skb() function. The issue arises when the size from the user's BPF program is an odd number, leading to an alignment problem in the struct skb_shared_info, which can cause a use-after-free read when KFENCE is enabled. The fix involves adjusting the size to ensure proper alignment.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is related to the BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) in the Linux kernel. Since BPF programs can be run from user space, and the issue is triggered via system calls (like bpf_prog_test_run), the attack vector is likely Network (N) because it can be exploited remotely over the network. However, wait, BPF programs are typically used in the context of network packet filtering, but the actual exploitation here might require local access to the system. Hmm, but the problem is that the user can pass an odd size to the BPF test run function, which is a system call. So, if an attacker can execute code that triggers this, they might need local privileges. But the original description doesn't mention remote exploitation. Wait, the CVE description says it's a problem in the kernel, but the attack vector depends on how the vulnerability is exploited. Since the vulnerability is in a system call that can be invoked by a user process, the attack vector might be Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the system to execute the BPF test run. However, if the BPF program is part of a network driver or something that can be triggered remotely, maybe it's Network. But the description doesn't mention remote exploitation. So I think AV is Local (L) because the attacker needs to run a program on the system to trigger the issue.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to an alignment problem when the size is odd. The attacker needs to craft a specific input (an odd size) to trigger the use-after-free. This seems to be a low complexity attack because it's a simple condition (odd size) that can be easily exploited once the vulnerability is known. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in a system call that requires certain privileges. However, the BPF test run function might be accessible to unprivileged users. Wait, in Linux, the BPF system calls can be used by unprivileged users, but some operations require CAP_BPF capability. However, the specific test run function might be accessible without elevated privileges. If the attacker can run the BPF test run without needing root, then PR is None (N). But if it requires some privileges, then it's Low or High. The description doesn't specify, but since it's a kernel vulnerability that can be triggered via a system call, I think PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges to exploit it. However, I need to be careful here. If the BPF test run requires certain capabilities, then PR might be Low. But the problem is that the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit would require the attacker to have the ability to run the BPF test run, which might be possible without root. So I'll go with PR: None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered by the user's input (the size parameter in the BPF test run). However, the exploit doesn't require any user interaction beyond the attacker's own actions. Since the attacker is the one initiating the system call, UI is None (N) because no additional user interaction is needed beyond the initial attack.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the kernel, and the impact is within the same component (the kernel). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the exploit doesn't involve a different component, the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The use-after-free read could potentially allow the attacker to read arbitrary memory, leading to information disclosure. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): If the attacker can write to memory via the use-after-free, they could corrupt data. However, the description mentions a read, not a write. So maybe I is Low or None. Wait, the vulnerability is a use-after-free read, which is a read of memory that's been freed. That could lead to information leakage but not necessarily data corruption. So I might be Low or None. However, the impact on integrity is not clear. If the attacker can't modify data, then I is None. But if the read could be used to infer data that's supposed to be protected, maybe it's Low. But the CVSS guidelines for I: High is if there's a complete loss of integrity, Low if partial, and None if no impact. Since the vulnerability is a read, not a write, I think I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The use-after-free could lead to a crash or denial of service. The description mentions a use-after-free read, which might cause the system to crash or become unstable. So A is High (H) because the attacker could cause the system to crash, leading to a DoS.\n\nWait, but the original problem is a use-after-free read. If the attacker can trigger this, it might cause the system to crash, which would be an availability impact. So A is High (H).\n\nLet me double-check each metric:\n\nAV: Local (L) because the attacker needs to run a program on the system to trigger the vulnerability.\n\nAC: Low (L) because the attack is straightforward once the input is crafted.\n\nPR: None (N) because the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges to exploit it.\n\nUI: None (N) because no user interaction is required beyond the attacker's own actions.\n\nS: Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability is within the same component.\n\nC: High (H) because the read could expose sensitive information.\n\nI: None (N) because there's no modification of data.\n\nA: High (H) because the use-after-free could lead to a crash or DoS.\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the Attack Vector. If the vulnerability is in a system call that can be invoked by a local user, then AV is Local. However, if the BPF program is part of a network driver, maybe it's Network. But the description doesn't mention remote exploitation. The problem is that the attacker needs to run the BPF test run, which is a local system call. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAnother point: the CVSS v3.1 metrics for AV: Network (N) is when the attack can be launched remotely, like over the network. Adjacent (A) is for local network, but that's more for things like Bluetooth. Local (L) is for attacks that require local access. Since the attacker needs to run a program on the system, AV is Local (L).\n\nSo the final vector string would be:\n\nAV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H\n\nBut wait, the availability impact is High (H) because the use-after-free could cause a crash. However, the original problem is a use-after-free read, which might not necessarily cause a crash. It depends on the context. If the read is to a freed memory that's not properly handled, it might cause a crash. So I think A is High (H).\n\nBut I'm a bit uncertain about the confidentiality impact. If the attacker can read arbitrary memory, that's a high confidentiality impact. So C is High (H). Integrity is None (N) because there's no modification. Availability is High (H) if the crash is possible.\n\nSo the final vector string is:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.09999999999999964, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the SMS Alert Order Notifications plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the sa_verify shortcode. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject scripts, which then execute when users access the affected pages.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in a plugin that's used on WordPress, which is typically accessed over the network. Since the attacker can inject scripts via a shortcode that's part of the website, the attack can be initiated remotely through the web. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is about how complex the attack is. Stored XSS usually requires the attacker to inject the payload into the application, which might involve some steps, but in this case, the vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization. If the attacker can inject the script through a form or a parameter that's stored, it's often considered Low complexity because the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps beyond exploiting the existing vulnerability. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) refers to the level of access the attacker needs. The description says authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above. Contributor-level access in WordPress allows users to create and edit content but not necessarily administrative functions. However, since the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a requirement. But in CVSS, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered \"Low\" because it's not requiring high privileges, but the user has to be authenticated. Wait, the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). The attacker needs to be authenticated, which is a privilege, but the level is contributor. Since contributor is a lower privilege than admin, but the CVSS PR metric is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege, but the level is considered Low if it's a standard user account. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but the options are N, L, H. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's not None. So PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have a user account (contributor level), which is a low privilege requirement.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is whether the user needs to interact with the attack. Since it's a stored XSS, the attacker injects the script into the application, and when a user accesses the page, the script executes. So the user doesn't need to interact with the attack vector; the script is executed automatically when the user views the page. Therefore, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). Since the vulnerability is in the plugin itself, and the attack is against the same component (the plugin's functionality), the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. For XSS, the primary impact is on integrity and confidentiality. The attacker can steal session cookies (confidentiality) or inject malicious scripts that alter the page (integrity). Availability might not be directly affected unless the script causes a denial of service, which isn't mentioned here. So C is High (H) because the attacker can steal sensitive information. I is High (H) because the attacker can inject scripts that alter the content. A is None (N) because there's no mention of availability impact.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nThe vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but I need to check if PR is correct. The attacker needs to be authenticated, which in CVSS terms, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered \"Low\" because it's not requiring high privileges. But the options for PR are None, Low, High. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. However, the CVSS PR metric is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege, but the level is considered Low if it's a standard user account. So PR is Low (L). So the vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

This depends on the values read from the llc_occupancy counters. The logic is applicable to architectures where the CLOSID effectively forms part of the monitoring identifier and so do not allow complete freedom to choose an unused monitoring identifier for a given CLOSID. This support missed that some platforms may not have these counters. This causes a NULL pointer dereference when creating a new control group as the array was not allocated by dom_data_init(). As this feature isn't necessary on platforms that don't have cache occupancy monitors, add this to the check that occurs when a new control group is allocated.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the resctrl module. The issue arises when creating a new control group on platforms without cache occupancy monitors. The problem is a NULL pointer dereference because the array wasn't allocated by dom_data_init().\n\nSo, the vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. Let's break down the metrics step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel-level issue, an attacker would need to have some way to trigger this. But the description doesn't mention any network exposure. However, since it's a kernel vulnerability, it's possible that an attacker could exploit it via a local exploit. But wait, the vulnerability is in the resctrl module, which is used for resource control. If an attacker can create a control group, maybe they can trigger this. But the attack vector here is likely local because it's a kernel-level issue that requires local access to exploit. So AV is Local (L). Wait, but sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger them through a service. However, the description doesn't mention that. It's more of a local issue. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. To exploit this, the attacker would need to create a control group in a specific way. The complexity here is low because the attacker just needs to trigger the code path that leads to the NULL dereference. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Since it's a kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need to have privileges to create a control group. Control groups are typically managed by the root user or processes with appropriate permissions. So the attacker would need to have root or high privileges. Therefore, PR is High (H). Wait, but maybe the vulnerability can be exploited by a local user with some privileges. However, if the attacker needs to have the ability to create a control group, which might require elevated privileges, then PR is High. But if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that can be accessed by a regular user, then PR might be Low. However, control groups are usually managed by the kernel and require certain privileges. So I think PR is High (H).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered by creating a control group. If the attacker can do this without user interaction, then UI is None (N). But if the user has to interact, like run a specific command, then it's Required (R). The description says that the vulnerability is triggered when creating a new control group. If the attacker can do this without user interaction, like through a service or a script, then UI is None. But if the user has to be tricked into running a command, then it's Required. However, the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit would require the attacker to have the ability to create a control group, which might be done by a local user. So UI is None (N) because it's a local exploit that doesn't require user interaction beyond the attacker's own actions.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the kernel, which is part of the same component. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability was in a different component that affects another part of the system, it might be Changed. But here, it's within the same scope, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): A NULL pointer dereference can lead to a crash, but does it allow unauthorized access to data? If the system crashes, it might not directly impact confidentiality. However, if the exploit can be used to gain elevated privileges, then confidentiality could be compromised. But the description doesn't mention data exposure. So maybe C is None (N). Wait, but if the system crashes, it might not directly impact confidentiality. However, if the vulnerability is exploited to gain access, then confidentiality could be affected. But the description doesn't specify that. So I think C is None (N) because the vulnerability itself doesn't directly lead to data exposure.\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the NULL pointer dereference might cause a crash, but does it allow modification of data? If the attacker can exploit this to gain control, they might be able to modify data. But again, the description doesn't mention integrity impact. So I would say I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): A NULL pointer dereference would cause the system to crash, leading to a denial of service. So availability is High (H) because the system becomes unavailable.\n\nWait, but the CVSS metrics for availability: High (H) means the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a complete loss of availability, such as a denial of service. Since a NULL pointer dereference would crash the kernel, leading to a system crash, that's a high impact on availability. So A is High (H).\n\nLet me check again:\n\nAV: Local (L) because it's a kernel vulnerability that requires local access.\n\nAC: Low (L) because the attack is straightforward once the attacker has the necessary privileges.\n\nPR: High (H) because creating a control group might require elevated privileges.\n\nUI: None (N) because no user interaction is needed beyond the attacker's own actions.\n\nS: Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability is within the same component.\n\nC: None (N) because there's no mention of data confidentiality being affected.\n\nI: None (N) because no data integrity issues are mentioned.\n\nA: High (H) because the system crash leads to denial of service.\n\nSo the vector would be AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm the PR. If the attacker needs to have privileges to create a control group, then PR is High. But if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that can be accessed by a regular user, then PR might be Low. However, control groups are typically managed by the kernel and require certain privileges. So I think PR is High (H) is correct.\n\nAnother point: the vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which is a type of crash. So the impact on availability is High. Therefore, the vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.0999999999999996, "success": true}

A SQL Injection vulnerability was identified in versions prior to 3.4.6 in the `idatendido_familiares` parameter of the `/html/funcionario/dependente_editarEndereco.php` endpoint. This vulnerability allows attacker to manipulate SQL queries and access sensitive database information, such as table names and sensitive data. Version 3.4.6 fixes the issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a SQL Injection in the WeGIA web manager, specifically in the `idatendido_familiares` parameter of the `/html/funcionario/dependente_editarEndereco.php` endpoint. The attack allows manipulation of SQL queries to access sensitive data like table names and data. The fix is in version 3.4.6.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in a web endpoint, which is accessible over the network. So AV is Network (N). If it required local access or physical access, it would be different, but since it's a web parameter, it's network-based.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): SQL Injection typically requires crafting a specific payload, but it's not always high complexity. However, if the vulnerability is straightforward to exploit, like a simple injection without needing complex conditions, AC might be Low (L). But sometimes, if it requires specific conditions, it's High. However, in many cases, SQLi is considered Low because it's often possible with a simple input. So I'll go with Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The description says an attacker can manipulate the SQL queries. If the endpoint is accessible without any authentication, then PR is None (N). If it requires user authentication, then it would be Low or High. The CVE doesn't mention needing authentication, so assuming it's accessible without, PR is N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): If the attack requires the user to interact, like clicking a link, then it's Required (R). But if it's a direct exploit without user interaction, like sending a crafted request, then it's None (N). Since the endpoint is a web parameter, an attacker can send a request directly, so UI is N.\n\nScope (S): This is about whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. Since the vulnerability is in the web application itself, the scope is Unchanged (U). If it affected a different component, like a database, it might be Changed, but here it's within the same application's scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows access to sensitive data, so this is High (H). If it only allowed partial access, it might be Low, but since it's accessing sensitive data like table names and data, High is appropriate.\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability allows manipulation of SQL queries, which could lead to data modification. However, the description mentions accessing data, not modifying it. But SQL Injection can sometimes be used to alter data. However, the CVE description specifically says \"access sensitive database information,\" which is more about confidentiality. If the integrity impact isn't mentioned, maybe it's None. Wait, but the CVSS base metrics require considering if the vulnerability can affect integrity. If the attacker can inject queries to alter data, then I would be High. However, the description doesn't mention data modification, only access. So maybe Integrity is None (N) unless there's an implication. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The original description says \"manipulate SQL queries and access sensitive database information.\" Manipulate might imply altering, but the result is accessing data. So maybe Integrity is Low or None. But since the primary impact is confidentiality, I might lean towards I being None unless there's a clear indication of integrity impact. The CVE description doesn't mention integrity, so I'll go with None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability allows access to data, but does it affect availability? If the attack could cause a denial of service, then A would be High. But the description doesn't mention that. So Availability is None (N).\n\nWait, but the CVSS base metrics for confidentiality, integrity, and availability are each rated as None, Low, or High. Since the vulnerability allows access to sensitive data, that's a High impact on confidentiality. For integrity and availability, unless the attack can modify data or disrupt service, they are None. The description doesn't mention those, so I think C is H, I and A are N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but I'm a bit uncertain about the Integrity. If the SQL injection could allow inserting or modifying data, that would be a High impact on integrity. However, the CVE description only mentions accessing data, not modifying it. So unless the attack can be used to alter data, which isn't stated, I think Integrity remains None. So the final metrics would be as above.\n\nNow, constructing the vector string:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n\nWait, but the user interaction was None, so UI:N.

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is an improper access control in Bitdefender Box 1 firmware versions up to 1.3.52.928. The attacker can downgrade the firmware to an older, vulnerable version. The attack requires the device to be in Recovery Mode and the attacker to be within the WiFi range.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The attacker needs to be within the WiFi range, which is a network-based attack. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says the attack requires the device to be in Recovery Mode. Is that considered low or high complexity? Well, if the attacker just needs to trigger a specific mode (like Recovery Mode) which might be a known method, maybe it's low. But if it's not straightforward, maybe high. However, since the attacker can exploit it by being in the WiFi range and triggering the mode, I think it's Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker is unauthenticated. So they don't need any privileges. That's None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack requires the attacker to be present in the WiFi range. Does that require user interaction? The user might need to be in the WiFi range, but the attack itself might not require any action from the user. Wait, the attacker needs to be present, but the device is in Recovery Mode. If the device is in Recovery Mode, maybe the user has to initiate that, but the vulnerability is that the access control is missing. Hmm. The description says the attack requires the device to be booted in Recovery Mode. If the attacker can trigger that mode without user interaction, then UI is None. But if the user has to be present (like pressing a button), then UI is Required. However, the description doesn't mention user interaction, just that the attacker needs to be in the WiFi range. So maybe UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the firmware) that's being attacked. So the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attack allows downgrading firmware, which might not directly impact confidentiality. But if the older firmware has vulnerabilities that could lead to data exposure, but the CVE itself is about access control. However, the CVSS metrics are based on the vulnerability's impact. Since the vulnerability allows firmware downgrade, which could lead to other issues, but the immediate impact here is not on confidentiality. Wait, the CVSS base score's confidentiality, integrity, and availability are about the impact of the vulnerability. If the vulnerability allows an attacker to downgrade firmware, which could lead to a system being in a vulnerable state, but the immediate impact might not be on confidentiality, integrity, or availability. However, the CVSS base score for impact is based on the potential impact. If the downgrade could allow access to data (if the older firmware has weaker access controls), then confidentiality might be High. But the CVE description doesn't specify that. Alternatively, maybe the downgrade itself doesn't directly impact confidentiality, but the vulnerability is about access control. Hmm, this is tricky. The original vulnerability is improper access control, which could allow unauthorized access. But the exploit here is downgrading firmware. If the downgrade allows the attacker to install a vulnerable firmware, which might have other vulnerabilities, but the immediate impact of the vulnerability (the access control flaw) might not directly affect confidentiality, integrity, or availability. However, the CVSS impact metrics are based on the potential impact of the vulnerability. If the attacker can downgrade the firmware, which could lead to a system being in a state where other vulnerabilities are exploitable, but the base score is about the vulnerability itself. Wait, the base score is for the vulnerability's inherent characteristics. The vulnerability is an improper access control that allows firmware downgrade. The impact of that would be that the attacker can install a different firmware. If the firmware is signed by Bitdefender, but the attacker can install an older version, maybe that's a way to bypass security measures. However, the immediate impact of the vulnerability (the access control flaw) might not directly affect confidentiality, integrity, or availability. But the CVSS impact metrics are based on the potential impact of the vulnerability. If the attacker can install a different firmware, that could lead to a system being in a vulnerable state, but the base score's impact metrics are about the vulnerability's direct impact. Since the vulnerability allows the attacker to perform an action (downgrade firmware), which could lead to other issues, but the base score's impact metrics are about the vulnerability's own impact. If the downgrade allows the attacker to gain access to the system, which could then lead to confidentiality, integrity, or availability issues, but the base score is for the vulnerability itself. This is confusing. Maybe the impact metrics here are all High because the attacker can take control of the device, leading to all three impacts. Alternatively, if the downgrade doesn't directly affect confidentiality, integrity, or availability, but allows the attacker to install a vulnerable firmware, which could then be exploited. But the base score is for the vulnerability, not the subsequent exploits. So perhaps the impact metrics are all High because the attacker can install a different firmware, which could be considered a high impact on all three. But I'm not sure. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. The impact metrics are based on the potential impact of the vulnerability. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to install arbitrary firmware, that could lead to full control of the device, which would be High for all three. So I think C, I, A are all High (H).\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "score": 4.1000000000000005, "success": true}

This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3. The issue is an improper access control, allowing a user to access another user's prompt data. The attack is done by accessing specific URLs, leading to exposure of critical information.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that unauthorized users can access data by accessing specific URLs. Since URLs are typically accessed over a network, AV should be Network (N). If it were local or physical, the attack vector would be different, but here it's through the web, so N makes sense.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability allows access by simply accessing specific URLs. That seems straightforward, so AC is Low (L). If it required complex steps or specific conditions, it would be High, but here it's just about accessing a URL, which is low complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The user doesn't need any special privileges; they just need to be an unauthorized user. So PR is None (N). If the attacker needed admin rights or some level of access, it would be different, but here it's just a regular user accessing URLs they shouldn't.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The attack doesn't require any interaction from the user. The attacker can just access the URL without needing the user to click a link or provide input. So UI is None (N). If the attack required the user to open a malicious link, it would be Required (R), but that's not the case here.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component where the data is stored. Since the access control is within the same application, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component or system, it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same application.\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows exposure of critical information (prompt data), so Confidentiality is High (H). If it was a minor leak, it might be Low, but critical info is High.\n\nIntegrity (I). The description doesn't mention any modification of data, only access. So Integrity is None (N). If the attacker could alter data, that would be a different metric, but here it's just reading.\n\nAvailability (A). There's no mention of the system becoming unavailable or degraded. The issue is about data exposure, not denial of service. So Availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Wait, but the example in the problem had C:H, I:H, A:H. Wait, the user's example had all three as H. But in this case, the vulnerability only affects confidentiality. The integrity and availability aren't impacted. So I and A should be N. Let me check again. The CVE says \"exposure of critical information,\" which is confidentiality. No mention of integrity or availability. So yes, C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Wait, but the example in the problem had C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. The actual values depend on the vulnerability. In this case, only confidentiality is affected. So I and A are N.

First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to a memory leak in the bpf_sk_select_reuseport() function. The issue arises when a TCP ESTABLISHED socket is looked up in a sockmap, and the socket might have had SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPF set before it was established. The fix involves dropping the sk's reference in error paths to prevent an unreferenced object.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is part of the operating system. However, the description doesn't mention if it's exploitable over the network, adjacent, local, or physical. Since it's a kernel-level issue, it might require local access to exploit. But wait, the original comment mentions that the issue is in the bpf_sk_select_reuseport() function, which is related to BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs. BPF programs can be loaded by user-space applications, so maybe an attacker could exploit this via a user-space application. However, without more details, I might need to assume that the attack vector is local (L) because kernel vulnerabilities often require local access unless there's a network component. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the BPF program is loaded via a network service, maybe it's network-based. Hmm. The description doesn't specify, so I might have to default to Local (L) unless there's a clear indication of network exploitation. But I'm not certain. Let me think again. The memory leak is in the kernel, but the exploit would require a user to run a program that triggers the issue. So maybe it's local. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a memory leak. Exploiting a memory leak typically requires some level of complexity, like crafting a specific payload or triggering the leak in a way that leads to arbitrary code execution. However, if the memory leak is a denial of service (DoS), then the attack complexity might be low. But the description doesn't mention if it's a DoS or if it can be exploited for more severe impacts. Since the fix is about a memory leak, maybe the exploit is a DoS. If that's the case, then AC could be Low (L) because it's easier to exploit. But I need to check if the vulnerability allows for remote code execution or just a DoS. The description doesn't specify, so I might have to assume that the attack complexity is Low (L) if it's a DoS, but if it's a more complex exploit, it might be High. However, without more info, I'll go with Low (L) as a default for a memory leak that could be exploited with minimal effort.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, an attacker would need to have some level of privileges. If the exploit requires root access, then PR would be High (H). But if it's a local exploit that can be triggered by a regular user, then PR would be Low (L) or None (N). However, kernel vulnerabilities often require local access with elevated privileges. But the BPF programs can be loaded by user-space applications, so maybe a user can exploit this without needing root. Wait, but BPF programs are typically run with certain privileges. If the vulnerability allows a user to trigger a memory leak that could be exploited, then maybe the attacker needs to have some privileges. However, the description doesn't specify. If the exploit can be done by a regular user, then PR is Low (L). If it requires root, then High (H). Since the fix is in the kernel, I think it's more likely that the attacker needs local access with some privileges, so PR is Low (L). But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that can be accessed by user-space programs without elevated privileges, then PR could be None (N). Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe I should go with Low (L) as a middle ground.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a memory leak. If the exploit requires the user to interact, like running a specific program, then UI is Required (R). If it can be exploited automatically without user interaction, then UI is None (N). The description mentions that the unreferenced object is from a process called \"test_progs\" with PID 44109. This suggests that the exploit might require a user to run a specific test program. Therefore, UI is Required (R). But if the vulnerability can be triggered by a service or automatically, then it's None. However, the example given is from a user process, so I think UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component as the affected system. If the vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel), then the scope is Unchanged (U). If it affects a different component, like a separate service, then it's Changed (C). Since the kernel is the main component, and the vulnerability is within it, S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability is a memory leak. A memory leak can lead to a denial of service (DoS) if the system runs out of memory. However, the description doesn't mention if it allows unauthorized access to data (Confidentiality) or modification of data (Integrity). If the memory leak is just a DoS, then C and I would be None (N), and A would be High (H) if the DoS is severe. But if the memory leak could be exploited to read or modify data, then C or I might be High. However, the description doesn't indicate that. The fix is about preventing an unreferenced object, which is a memory leak. So the primary impact is on availability (A), leading to a DoS. Therefore, C and I are None (N), and A is High (H). But wait, if the memory leak is not directly causing a DoS but just a resource leak, maybe the impact is lower. However, in CVSS, if the vulnerability can be exploited to cause a DoS, then A is High. If it's a low-impact DoS, maybe Low. But without more info, I'll assume High (H) for A.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) – The vulnerability is in the kernel, requiring local access.\nAC: Low (L) – Exploiting a memory leak might be relatively simple.\nPR: Low (L) – The attacker might need local privileges but not necessarily root.\nUI: Required (R) – The exploit requires user interaction, like running a specific program.\nS: Unchanged (U) – The vulnerability affects the same component (kernel).\nC: None (N) – No impact on confidentiality.\nI: None (N) – No impact on integrity.\nA: High (H) – The memory leak could lead to a denial of service.\n\nNow, the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nWait, but earlier I thought UI might be Required (R) because the example shows a user process. However, if the exploit can be triggered without user interaction, like through a service, then UI would be None. But the example given is from a user process, so I think UI is Required. However, I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The description says \"unreferenced object 0xffff888101911800 (size 2048): comm \"test_progs\", pid 44109...\" which indicates that the process \"test_progs\" is the one that triggered the leak. So the user would need to run this program, which requires user interaction. Therefore, UI is Required (R).\n\nSo the final vector string is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.5, "success": true}

This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted NAS packet.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the decode_access_point_name_ie function of the Linux Foundation Magma up to version 1.8.0. The issue allows attackers to cause a DoS via a crafted NAS packet.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted NAS packet. Since NAS packets are typically transmitted over a network, the attack vector is likely Network (N). If it required physical access or adjacent network, it would be different, but here it's a network-based attack.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). Buffer overflows often require specific conditions to exploit, but if the attacker can craft a packet that triggers the overflow without needing complex steps, it might be Low (L). However, sometimes buffer overflows can be tricky, but in this case, the description says \"crafted NAS packet\" which might imply that it's not too complex. So I'll go with Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability is in a function that processes incoming packets. If the attacker doesn't need any special privileges to send the packet, then PR is None (N). Since it's a DoS, the attacker just needs to send the packet, which doesn't require elevated privileges. So PR is N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The attack is via a crafted packet, which doesn't require any user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability is in the Magma component, which is part of the system. If the vulnerability affects the same component (unchanged scope), then S is Unchanged (U). If it's in a different component, it might be Changed (C). But since the attack is within the same system's processing, I think S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability causes a DoS, which affects Availability. The description doesn't mention data leakage or corruption, so Confidentiality and Integrity are None (N). Availability is High (H) because the DoS is a complete denial of service, which is a high impact.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Wait, but the original problem says the answer example has C:H, I:H, A:H.

Let me check again.\n\nThe CVE description says the vulnerability allows a DoS. So the impact is on Availability (A) being High. Confidentiality (C) and Integrity (I) are not affected. So C:N, I:N, A:H. Therefore, the correct metrics are C:N, I:N, A:H.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Eventer plugin for WordPress. It's due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level or higher permissions to inject scripts, which then execute when users access the affected pages.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the attacker can inject scripts via shortcodes, which are part of the WordPress plugin. Since WordPress is typically accessed over the network (via the web), the attack vector is likely Network (N). Unless the vulnerability requires physical access or local access, which it doesn't here. So AV is N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which usually requires the attacker to have some way to inject the payload. However, the description says that the attacker needs to be authenticated. But the attack complexity here is about how complex the attack is. Since the attacker just needs to inject the script into a page (which might be done through a form or some input field), and the exploit is straightforward once the attacker has access, I think AC is Low (L). High would be if the attack required multiple steps or specific conditions, but here it's a simple injection.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs contributor-level or higher permissions. In WordPress, contributor-level access allows editing posts but not necessarily full admin rights. However, the vulnerability is stored, so the attacker doesn't need to have elevated privileges beyond contributor. But the PR metric considers the level of privileges required. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated as a contributor, which is a low level of privilege (as opposed to admin), but the options are None, Low, High. Wait, the options are PR: None (N), Low (L), High (H). So if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a requirement. But in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered as requiring some privileges. However, contributor-level is a low level of privilege. So PR would be Low (L). Wait, but if the attacker needs to be authenticated, does that count as requiring privileges? Or is it considered as needing to have some access? Hmm. The CVSS PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a requirement, but the level of privilege is low (contributor). So PR is Low (L). Alternatively, if the attacker doesn't need any privileges, it's N. But here, they do need to be authenticated, so PR is Low. So PR: L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is stored, meaning the attacker injects the script into the page, and when a user accesses the page, the script executes. So user interaction is not required for the attack to occur. The user doesn't need to do anything beyond accessing the page. Therefore, UI is None (N). If the attack required the user to click on a link or interact, it would be Required (R), but here it's automatic upon access.\n\nScope (S). The scope is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (unchanged) or a different component (changed). Since the vulnerability is in the Eventer plugin, which is part of the WordPress ecosystem, and the attack affects the same component (the plugin's output), the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component (like a different service), it would be Changed. But here, it's within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A). The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which can lead to stealing session cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the site. So all three impacts are high. The attacker can read data (C:H), modify data (I:H), and potentially cause denial of service (A:H) if the script is malicious. However, stored XSS typically affects confidentiality and integrity more than availability. But the CVSS metrics for impact are based on the potential for the vulnerability to affect these aspects. Since the attacker can inject scripts that can read or modify data, C and I are High. Availability might be Low or None unless the attack specifically targets availability. But the description doesn't mention availability issues, so A is None (N). Wait, but the problem says \"arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\" So the scripts could be anything, including ones that cause DoS. However, the default assumption is that if the vulnerability allows for arbitrary script execution, the impact on confidentiality and integrity is high, but availability might not be directly affected unless the script is designed to do so. So A is None (N). But I need to check the CVSS guidelines. The impact metrics are based on the potential for the vulnerability to affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information system. For XSS, the primary impacts are confidentiality (stealing session cookies) and integrity (modifying content). Availability is not typically a primary impact unless the attack is specifically designed to disrupt service. So C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but I need to check if PR is Low or None. The attacker needs to be authenticated, which is a requirement. In CVSS, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered as requiring privileges. The PR metric is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a requirement, but the level of privilege is low (contributor). So PR is Low (L). So the above is correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the PR metric. The options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to have some level of privilege (like contributor), that's Low. If the attacker needs admin rights, that's High. So yes, PR is Low here.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in IBM UrbanCode Deploy versions up to certain patches. The issue is that sensitive info is stored in log files, which a local user with access to HTTP request logs can read.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that a local user can access the logs. Since the attack requires local access, AV should be Local (L). Wait, but wait—does the user need to be on the same system? The logs are stored on the server, so the attacker needs local access to the server. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is about reading log files. If the logs are accessible without any complex steps, then AC is Low (L). The user just needs access to the logs, which might be a simple read operation. So AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user needs to have access to the HTTP request logs. If the logs are stored in a location that requires no special privileges (like a public directory), then PR is None (N). But if the logs are in a restricted area, maybe the user needs some privileges. However, the description says \"a local user with access to HTTP request logs\"—so the user already has access. Therefore, PR is None (N) because no additional privileges are needed beyond what's already required to access the logs.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The user needs to access the logs. If the attack requires the user to interact with the system (like clicking a link or something), UI would be Required (R). But in this case, the user just needs to access the logs, which might be a passive action. However, the UI metric is about whether user interaction is required for the attack to succeed. If the user has to open the log file, that's a user action. But maybe the logs are automatically accessible, so UI is None (N). Hmm, this is a bit tricky. If the user has to interact (like open the log file), then UI is Required. But if the logs are accessible via a web interface that the user can access without further interaction, maybe UI is None. The description says \"could be read by a local user with access to HTTP request logs.\" So the user has access, and the logs are stored in a place they can read. So maybe UI is None because no interaction is needed beyond having access. I think UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the log files) that the user is interacting with. Since the attack doesn't change the scope (i.e., it's within the same component), S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The sensitive information is being read, so confidentiality is High (H) because the data is exposed.\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability doesn't involve modifying data, just reading it. So Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't affect the availability of the system. So Availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Wait, but the CVSS v3.1 base score calculation might have different values. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the attack vector is Local (L) because the user is local. Attack complexity is Low (L) because it's straightforward. Privileges required is None (N) because the user already has access. User interaction is None (N) because no interaction is needed beyond accessing the logs. Scope is Unchanged (U). Confidentiality is High (H) because sensitive data is exposed. Integrity and Availability are None (N) since the issue is about data exposure, not modification or denial of service.\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a pre-authentication deserialization of untrusted data in the SMA1000 Appliance Management Console (AMC) and Central Management Console (CMC). This allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands under specific conditions.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions a \"remote unauthenticated attacker,\" which implies that the attack can be performed over a network without needing physical access. So AV should be Network (N).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is described as enabling execution of arbitrary commands, which might not require complex steps.

It's not something that requires multiple steps or specific conditions beyond the exploit itself.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is about the level of privileges needed. The attacker is unauthenticated, so they don't need any prior privileges. Therefore, PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) refers to whether the user needs to interact for the attack to succeed.

So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) determines if the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different one (Changed). Since the vulnerability is in the management consoles themselves, the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary OS commands, which can lead to complete compromise of the system. This would affect all three aspects: an attacker could read confidential data (C:H), modify data or system integrity (I:H), and disrupt availability (A:H). So all three are High (H).\n\nPutting it all together, the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. Let me double-check each metric to ensure they align with the description.

So we move a null check before dereference.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. The CVE is about a NULL pointer dereference in the Linux kernel's pinctrl module. The vulnerability is fixed by adding a null check before dereferencing pdesc->name. \n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel-level issue, it's likely exploitable remotely. But wait, the description doesn't mention network access. However, kernel vulnerabilities can often be exploited via local access, like through a local user or application. But if the code is part of a driver that's used by user-space applications, maybe it's possible to trigger it from user space. However, without more info, I think the default for kernel issues is usually Local (L) unless it's a network service. But I'm not sure. Wait, the vulnerability is in the pinctrl code, which is part of the kernel's device drivers. So, to exploit this, an attacker would need to have access to the system, maybe through a local user or a privileged process. So AV is probably Local (L). But I need to check if there's any way this could be exploited remotely. Since the problem is a NULL dereference, which can cause a crash, but to trigger it, the attacker would need to call the function that leads to the dereference. If the function is called from user space, then maybe a local user could exploit it. But if it's only called internally by the kernel, then maybe it's not exploitable from outside. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Maybe I should go with Local (L) because kernel vulnerabilities are typically local unless there's a network component involved. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the code is part of a driver that's accessed via a device, maybe Adjacent (A) or Network (N). But without more context, I think AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a NULL dereference. To exploit this, the attacker would need to trigger the function that leads to the dereference. If the code is in a function that's called with certain parameters, maybe the attacker can craft input to cause the pdesc to be NULL. However, the complexity here is low because the attacker just needs to find a way to make pdesc NULL, which might be possible with a specific input. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Since this is a kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need high privileges to exploit it. Because kernel code runs with the highest privileges, so to trigger this, the attacker would need to have some way to execute code in the kernel. However, if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that can be accessed by user-space applications, maybe the attacker can exploit it with lower privileges. But typically, kernel vulnerabilities require high privileges. Wait, but if the code is part of a driver that's accessible via a system call or device file, maybe a local user could exploit it with low privileges. However, in this case, the vulnerability is a NULL dereference that would cause a crash, but to exploit it for arbitrary code execution, the attacker would need to have some way to trigger the condition. But the original description doesn't mention exploitation, just the fix. So maybe the PR is High (H) because the attacker needs to have kernel-level privileges to exploit it. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the code is in a part of the kernel that can be accessed by user-space, maybe the attacker can exploit it with low privileges. But I think for kernel vulnerabilities, PR is usually High (H) unless it's a user-space issue. So I'll go with High (H) for PR.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a NULL dereference. Exploiting it would require the attacker to trigger the function that leads to the dereference. If the attacker can do this without any user interaction, then UI is None (N). If the user has to interact, like click a link or open a file, then it's Required (R). But in this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so it's likely that the attacker can exploit it without user interaction, perhaps through a local exploit. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects a different component, like a library or another system, then it would be Changed (C). But here, it's within the kernel, so S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability is a NULL dereference, which can cause a denial of service (crash). However, if the attacker can exploit it to gain access, they might be able to read or modify data. But the original description doesn't mention data leakage or modification. The fix is to prevent the dereference, which would prevent the crash. So the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability would be High (H) for availability because the system could crash, leading to a DoS. But for confidentiality and integrity, if the vulnerability doesn't allow data access or modification, then those would be None (N). However, in some cases, a NULL dereference could be exploited to cause a crash, which is an availability issue. So C and I would be None (N), and A would be High (H). Wait, but the CVSS v3.1 impact metrics are based on the potential impact. If the vulnerability can be exploited to cause a crash, then availability is High. But if it's just a crash without further exploitation, maybe it's Low. However, the standard for availability is High if the system is completely unavailable. So I think A is High (H). C and I are None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't allow unauthorized access to data or modification of data.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: High (H)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nWait, but earlier I was uncertain about AV. Let me recheck. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the code is part of a driver that's used by user-space applications, then maybe the attacker can exploit it with local access. So AV is Local (L). But if the code is part of a network driver, maybe Network (N). However, the description doesn't mention network. So I think AV is Local (L) is correct.\n\nBut another thought: kernel vulnerabilities are often considered as requiring local access, so AV is Local (L). So the vector would be AV:L, AC:L, PR:H, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H.\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about PR. If the attacker needs to have kernel privileges to exploit this, then PR is High (H). But if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that can be accessed by user-space code, maybe the attacker can exploit it with low privileges. However, in most cases, kernel vulnerabilities require high privileges. So PR is High (H).\n\nSo the final answer would be the vector string as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.0999999999999996, "success": true}

A known situation is the failure of a websocket handshake will trigger a local reply leading to the crash of Envoy. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.33.1, 1.32.4, 1.31.6, and 1.30.10.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in Envoy's ext_proc HTTP filter. The issue is that if a local reply is sent to the external server due to a lifetime issue, it can cause Envoy to crash. Specifically, a failed WebSocket handshake triggers this local reply, leading to a crash. The fix is in versions 1.33.1 and others.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The description mentions that the vulnerability is triggered by a local reply. However, the attack vector here might be Network (N) because the external server is involved. Wait, but the problem is that the local reply is sent to the external server. Wait, the attack is initiated by an external server? Or is it a local process? Hmm. The filter is part of Envoy, which is a proxy. If the external server is sending a request that causes the local reply, maybe the attack vector is Network. Because the attacker would need to send a request to Envoy that triggers the WebSocket handshake failure, which then causes the local reply. So the attack is over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is triggered by a specific scenario—failure of a WebSocket handshake. This seems to be a specific condition, but not necessarily complex. If the attacker can cause the handshake to fail, which might be straightforward, then AC is Low (L). Because it doesn't require complex steps, just exploiting the specific condition.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the Envoy proxy. If an attacker can send a request to Envoy, they might not need any privileges. Since the attack is via a network request, the attacker doesn't need to have any special privileges on the system. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention that user interaction is required. The attack is automated through the WebSocket handshake failure. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the Envoy proxy itself. Since the attack is on the same component (the proxy) and doesn't involve a different component, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to another component, it would be Changed, but here it's within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability causes a crash, but does it lead to unauthorized access to data? The description says it's a crash, which might not directly impact confidentiality. However, if the crash leads to a denial of service, but the question is about confidentiality. Since the vulnerability doesn't mention data exposure, C is None (N). Wait, but maybe the crash could be exploited to leak information? The description doesn't say that. So I think C is None.\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the crash doesn't directly affect the integrity of data. Unless the crash allows an attacker to modify data, but the description doesn't mention that. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The crash would cause Envoy to stop functioning, leading to a denial of service. So Availability is High (H), because the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause the service to crash, which is a high impact on availability.\n\nWait, but the CVSS base metrics for availability: High (H) means the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a complete loss of availability. Since the crash would make Envoy unavailable, that's a high impact. So A is High (H).\n\nLet me check again. The attack vector is network, attack complexity low, privileges required none, user interaction none, scope unchanged, confidentiality none, integrity none, availability high. So the vector would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the original problem says that the vulnerability is a crash. So the impact is on availability. So the base score would be based on those metrics.\n\nWait, but the CVSS v3.1 base score calculation uses the impact metrics (C, I, A) to calculate the impact score. If all three are N, then the impact is zero. But in this case, A is H. So the impact score would be calculated based on A being H, and C and I being N. Let me confirm the impact calculation. The formula for impact is:\n\nImpact = 1 - [(1 - Confidentiality) * (1 - Integrity) * (1 - Availability)]\n\nBut since C and I are N (no impact), their values are 0. Availability is H, which is 0.56. So:\n\nImpact = 1 - [(1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0.56)] = 1 - [1 * 1 * 0.44] = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56. Then the impact score is 0.56.\n\nThen the exploitability score is calculated with AV:N (1.0), AC:L (0.77), PR:N (0.85), UI:N (0.85). The formula is:\n\nExploitability = 8.22 * AV * AC * PR * UI\n\nSo 8.22 * 1.0 * 0.77 * 0.85 * 0.85. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 0.77 * 0.85 = 0.6545. Then 0.6545 * 0.85 ≈ 0.5563. Then 8.22 * 1.0 * 0.5563 ≈ 4.57.\n\nThen the base score is (Exploitability + Impact) / 2, but only if Impact is greater than 0. So (4.57 + 0.56) / 2 ≈ 2.565. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the formula is:\n\nBase Score = (Exploitability Score) + (Impact Score) - (Exploitability Score * Impact Score) / 1.18\n\nWait, no, the correct formula for CVSS v3.1 base score is:\n\nIf Impact > 0:\n\nBase Score = (Exploitability Score) + (Impact Score) - (Exploitability Score * Impact Score) / 1.18\n\nBut I might be mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, the base score is calculated as:\n\nIf Impact is 0, then the base score is the exploitability score. Otherwise, it's the formula above.\n\nBut regardless, the user is not asking for the actual score, just the vector string. So the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but the problem says to determine the values for each base metric. Let me recheck each metric again.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The attack is over the network, as the external server is involved. So AV is N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The attack requires triggering a specific condition (WebSocket handshake failure), which is not complex. So AC is L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any privileges, as they can send a request to Envoy. So PR is N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): No user interaction is needed. The attack is automated. So UI is N.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the same component (Envoy), so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): No impact on confidentiality. So C is N.\n\nIntegrity (I): No impact on integrity. So I is N.\n\nAvailability (A): High impact because the crash leads to denial of service. So A is H.\n\nTherefore, the vector string is AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

The logic in commit 4f408e1fa6e1 (\"ibmvnic: retry reset if there are no other resets\") introduces an issue that results in a 32 byte memory leak whenever the last rwi in the list gets processed.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the ibmvnic driver. The issue is a memory leak of 32 bytes when the last rwi in the list is processed successfully. The fix was to free the rwi structure in that scenario.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a memory leak, it's not something that can be exploited remotely over the network. However, if an attacker has access to the system, maybe through a local exploit, they could exploit this. But the description doesn't mention any remote exploit. So AV is likely Local (L) or maybe Physical (P) if it requires physical access. But since it's a kernel vulnerability, it's possible that an attacker with local privileges could exploit it. But I'm not sure. Wait, the vulnerability is a memory leak. Memory leaks themselves are not typically exploitable unless they lead to other issues like use-after-free or buffer overflows. But the description says it's a 32-byte leak, which might not be exploitable. However, the CVSS might still consider it as a vulnerability that requires local access. So AV is probably Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): If the vulnerability requires specific conditions to be exploited, like a specific sequence of operations, then AC is High. But if it's straightforward, then Low. Since it's a memory leak, maybe the attacker needs to trigger the specific scenario where the last rwi is processed. That might be considered Low complexity if it's easy to do. But I'm not sure. Maybe High? Hmm. Wait, the vulnerability is a memory leak, which might not be directly exploitable. But if the CVSS is considering the potential for exploitation, maybe AC is Low if it's easy to exploit once you have access. But I'm not certain. Let me think again. The vulnerability is a memory leak, which might not be directly exploitable. However, the CVSS might still assign AC as Low if the attack is straightforward once the attacker has access. But I'm not sure. Maybe High? I need to check the guidelines. The AC metric is about the complexity of the attack. If the attacker needs to perform a specific action, like sending a specific packet, then it's Low. If it's more complex, like needing to bypass multiple protections, then High. Since this is a kernel memory leak, maybe the attacker needs to have local access and trigger the specific code path. That might be considered Low complexity. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have some level of privileges. Since it's a kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need to have local access, possibly with root privileges. But the description doesn't specify. However, if the vulnerability is in the kernel, then the attacker would need to have local access to exploit it. So PR is High (H) because the attacker needs high privileges. Wait, but if the vulnerability is in a driver that's accessible via a user-space application, maybe PR is Low. But the description says it's in the Linux kernel, so it's part of the kernel space. Exploiting a kernel vulnerability typically requires high privileges. So PR is High (H). But wait, if the attacker can exploit it without needing elevated privileges, then PR would be Low. But I think in this case, since it's a kernel-level issue, the attacker would need to have local access, which might require some privileges. However, the exact PR depends on whether the exploit requires the attacker to have existing privileges. If the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that can be accessed by a user process, maybe PR is Low. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The vulnerability is a memory leak in the ibmvnic driver. If the driver is part of the kernel, then an attacker would need to have access to the system to trigger the code path that leads to the leak. So PR is probably High (H) because the attacker needs to have local access, which might require some privileges. But maybe the PR is Low if the attacker can exploit it without needing elevated privileges. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. I'll go with High (H) for PR.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability doesn't require user interaction. It's a memory leak that occurs during normal operation. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel) that is being attacked. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects a different component, like a service that's part of the system, then it would be Changed (C). But here, it's within the kernel, so S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability is a memory leak. If the memory leak could expose sensitive data, then C is High. But a 32-byte leak might not be significant. However, if the data in that memory is sensitive, then it could be a confidentiality issue. But the description doesn't mention any data exposure. So maybe C is None (N) because the leak doesn't impact confidentiality. Alternatively, if the memory is part of a structure that holds sensitive data, then C could be High. But without more info, I think it's safe to assume C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the memory leak might not affect the integrity of the system. Unless the leak leads to data corruption, which isn't mentioned here. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The memory leak could potentially lead to resource exhaustion if the leak is repeated. However, a 32-byte leak is minimal and unlikely to cause a denial of service. So A is None (N).\n\nWait, but the CVSS guidelines for availability: if the vulnerability could cause a denial of service, then A is High. But a 32-byte leak is not enough to cause a DoS. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) because the vulnerability is in the kernel and requires local access.\nAC: Low (L) because the attack is straightforward once local access is obtained.\nPR: High (H) because the attacker needs high privileges to exploit the kernel vulnerability.\nUI: None (N) because no user interaction is required.\nS: Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability affects the same component.\nC: None (N) because the leak doesn't impact confidentiality.\nI: None (N) because the leak doesn't impact integrity.\nA: None (N) because the leak doesn't impact availability.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about AV. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, but the attack vector is through a local exploit, then AV is Local (L). However, if the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, then AV would be Network (N). But the description doesn't mention remote exploitation. So AV is Local (L).\n\nBut maybe the attack vector is considered as Local because the attacker needs to be on the system. So AV is L.\n\nSo the vector string would be:\n\nAV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N\n\nBut wait, the CVSS v3.1 base score calculation also depends on the metrics. However, the user just wants the metrics and the vector string. So based on the above reasoning, the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N\n\nBut I need to check if the PR is High. If the attacker needs to have local privileges, then PR is High. But if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that can be accessed by a user process without needing elevated privileges, then PR could be Low. However, kernel vulnerabilities typically require high privileges. So I think PR is High (H) is correct.\n\nAnother point: the vulnerability is a memory leak. In CVSS, if the vulnerability is a memory leak that could be exploited, but the exploit requires local access, then the metrics would be as above. However, if the memory leak is not directly exploitable, then maybe the impact metrics (C, I, A) are None. But the CVSS guidelines state that if the vulnerability could lead to a security impact, even if it's not directly exploitable, but the potential exists, then the impact metrics should be considered. However, in this case, the description says it's a 32-byte leak, which is minimal and not likely to be exploitable. So the impact metrics are None.\n\nSo the final vector string is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 5.5, "success": true}

The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of user-supplied format strings in the `AgentOutputBlock` implementation, where malicious input is passed to the Jinja2 templating engine without adequate security measures. Attackers can exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. The issue is fixed in version 0.4.0.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in AutoGPT versions up to 0.3.4, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The issue is due to improper handling of user-supplied format strings in the `AgentOutputBlock` using Jinja2 without proper security measures.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that attackers can exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary commands. Since it's a server-side vulnerability and the input is user-supplied, it's likely that the attack can be done over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The vulnerability allows RCE, which typically requires some level of complexity. However, if the exploit is straightforward, like sending a crafted payload, it might be Low (L). But I need to check if there's any mention of needing specific conditions. The description says \"malicious input is passed to Jinja2 without adequate security measures,\" which suggests that the attack might be possible with a simple payload. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) refers to the level of access needed by the attacker. Since the vulnerability is in the server-side code and the input is from the user, it's possible that no special privileges are needed. The attacker just needs to send the malicious input through the application. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is whether the attacker needs the user to interact. The description doesn't mention that user interaction is required. The exploit is through the server-side processing of user input, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. Since the vulnerability is in the server-side code and the attack leads to RCE on the host system, the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the attack affects the host system, maybe it's a different component. Hmm, but the scope in CVSS is about whether the vulnerability affects the same component (unchanged) or a different one (changed). Since the vulnerability is in the server application and the RCE is on the same host, maybe it's Unchanged. I think S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. The vulnerability allows RCE, which can lead to complete compromise of the system. So all three impacts are High (H). The attacker can read, modify, or disrupt the system's availability.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:H.

This vulnerability affects Firefox < 135, Firefox ESR < 115.20, Firefox ESR < 128.7, Thunderbird < 128.7, and Thunderbird < 135.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is a race condition during concurrent delazification leading to a use-after-free. It affects various versions of Firefox and Thunderbird.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description doesn't mention any specific requirement for physical access or adjacent network. Since it's a web browser vulnerability, it's likely exploitable over the network. So AV is probably Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a race condition. Race conditions can sometimes be exploited with low complexity if the attacker can trigger the race. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the browser, which typically requires no special privileges. If an attacker can exploit this, they might not need any user privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention needing user interaction. If it's a use-after-free in a browser, maybe it requires the user to open a malicious link, but the original description doesn't specify. However, since it's a race condition, maybe it's possible without user interaction. But I'm a bit unsure here. Wait, the original CVE says \"could have led to a use-after-free\" but doesn't specify if user interaction is needed. If the exploit requires the user to visit a malicious site, then UI would be Required (R). But if it's a remote code execution without user action, maybe UI is None. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let me think again. Use-after-free vulnerabilities in browsers often require user interaction, like visiting a malicious page. So maybe UI is Required (R). But the original description doesn't explicitly state that. However, since it's a race during concurrent delazification, perhaps it's possible without user interaction. I'm not sure. Maybe I should go with None (N) if the exploit can be triggered remotely without user action. But I need to be cautious here. Let me check some examples. For example, if a vulnerability is in a service that's always running, maybe UI is None. But browsers usually require user interaction. So maybe UI is Required (R). I'll go with Required (R) for now.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the browser, which is part of the same component. If the exploit doesn't change the scope (i.e., the vulnerability is in the same component), then S is Unchanged (U). If it's in a different component, it would be Changed (C). Since it's a browser vulnerability, I think S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The use-after-free can lead to arbitrary code execution, which would impact all three. So C, I, A are High (H). Because if an attacker can execute arbitrary code, they can access confidential data, modify data, and cause denial of service.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: R (Required) or N? Wait, earlier I was confused. Let me recheck. If the vulnerability is in the browser, and the exploit requires the user to open a malicious link, then UI is Required. But if the exploit can be triggered without user interaction, like through a network service, then UI is None. The original description says \"could have led to a use-after-free\" but doesn't specify. However, in most cases, browser vulnerabilities require user interaction. So I think UI is Required (R). But I'm not 100% sure. However, the CVSS guidelines say that if user interaction is required, UI is R. If not, it's N. Since the vulnerability is in a browser, which typically requires user interaction, I'll go with R.\n\nSo the metrics would be:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:H.\n\nWait, but if UI is Required, then the vector would have UI:R. But I need to confirm. Let me think again. If the exploit requires the user to interact (e.g., click a link), then UI is R. If the exploit can be triggered without user interaction (like a remote exploit), then UI is N. The original CVE description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is in a browser, which usually requires user interaction. So UI:R.\n\nSo the final vector would be:\n\nAV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\nBut wait, the original answer example had UI:N. Maybe I'm wrong here. Let me check. For example, if the vulnerability is in a service that's always running, like a server, then UI could be N. But browsers are client applications. However, the exploit might require the user to open a malicious link. So UI:R. But some sources might consider that as required. However, in some cases, if the vulnerability is in a component that's automatically processed (like a plugin), maybe UI is not required. But without explicit info, it's hard. The original CVE description doesn't mention user interaction, so maybe UI:N. But that's a guess. Alternatively, if the vulnerability is in the browser's code, and the exploit requires the user to visit a malicious site, then UI is R. But if the exploit can be triggered via a network service without user interaction, then UI:N. Since the CVE mentions Firefox and Thunderbird, which are user applications, I think UI:R is more accurate. However, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check the CVSS guidelines again. The User Interaction metric is 'Required' if the attacker must trick a user into initiating the attack. If the attack can be initiated without user interaction, then it's 'None'. Since the vulnerability is a race condition during delazification, which might be triggered by the browser processing a malicious input, which would require the user to interact (e.g., open a link), then UI:R. So I'll stick with UI:R.\n\nTherefore, the final vector is:\n\nAV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 1.3000000000000007, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the ElementsKit plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the URL attribute of a custom widget. The attacker needs to be authenticated with Contributor-level access or higher to inject the scripts, and the scripts execute when a user accesses the injected page.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is stored in the plugin, so the attack can be initiated remotely over the network. Since it's a web application, the attack vector is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The description mentions that the attacker needs to inject the script via a custom widget. However, since it's a stored XSS, the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps beyond exploiting the input vulnerability. So, the complexity is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is about the level of access needed. The attacker needs to be authenticated as a Contributor or higher. In WordPress, Contributor access allows editing posts but not publishing. However, the vulnerability allows injecting scripts into pages that execute when accessed. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated, but the required privileges are not high (Contributor is a lower level), I think PR is Low (L). Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. But in CVSS, PR is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. However, the options for PR are N, L, H. If the required privilege is Contributor, which is a lower level, maybe it's considered Low. But I need to check. For example, if the attacker needs admin privileges, that's High. If they need user-level access, that's Low. Since Contributor is a user-level access, maybe PR is Low. But I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, if the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, PR is N. But in this case, they need to be authenticated, so PR is Low. So I'll go with PR: Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is whether the user needs to interact for the attack to succeed. Since it's a stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact; the script executes when they access the page. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) refers to whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. Since the plugin is part of WordPress, and the vulnerability is in the plugin itself, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed. But here, it's within the same scope, so S: U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. For XSS, the main impact is on confidentiality and integrity. The attacker can steal session cookies (confidentiality) or inject malicious scripts (integrity). Availability might not be directly affected unless the script causes a denial of service, which isn't mentioned here. So C: High (H), I: High (H), A: None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but I need to check if PR is correct. Let me re-examine the PR. The attacker needs to be authenticated with Contributor access. In CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. However, the options are N, L, H. If the required privilege is low (like user-level), then PR is Low. If it's high (admin), then High. Since Contributor is a lower privilege than admin, but higher than a regular user? Wait, in WordPress, Contributor can edit posts but not publish. But for the purpose of CVSS, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. However, the CVSS PR metric considers whether the attacker needs to have privileges. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any privileges, PR is N. If they need to have some level of privilege (like user access), then PR is Low. If they need admin-level access, then High. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated (Contributor level), which is a user-level privilege, PR is Low. So PR: L is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final vector string is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of U3D files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25557.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to go through the CVE description and figure out each metric based on the given options.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description says it's a remote attack, as the user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. Since that's over a network, AV should be Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The vulnerability is due to a lack of validation leading to an out-of-bounds read. Exploiting this might require some specific steps, but since it's an information disclosure, maybe it's low complexity. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) – the user needs to interact by visiting a malicious page or opening a file. But the attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the system. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is required here because the user has to open the malicious file or visit the page. So UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S) – the vulnerability is in the application itself, so the scope doesn't change. It's Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C) – the vulnerability allows disclosure of sensitive information, so that's High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I) – the description mentions that the attacker can leverage this with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code. But the primary issue here is information disclosure, not directly affecting integrity. However, since arbitrary code execution is possible, maybe Integrity is High? Wait, but the main impact here is information disclosure. The CVSS base metrics are based on the primary impact. The vulnerability itself is an information disclosure, so maybe I is Low or None? Hmm, the description says \"leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.\" So the primary impact is information disclosure, but the potential for code execution is a secondary effect. Since the base score is based on the primary impact, I might be Low or None. Wait, the CVSS guidelines say that if the vulnerability can be used to cause a loss of integrity, even if it's not the primary impact, but in this case, the primary is confidentiality. So maybe I is None? Or maybe the fact that it can be used to execute code implies that integrity is affected. This is a bit tricky. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 guidelines again. The base score considers the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. If the vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution, that would affect integrity (since the attacker can modify data or the system). However, the primary issue here is information disclosure. But the CVSS base metrics are based on the maximum impact. So if the vulnerability can be used to cause a high impact on integrity, even if that's not the primary, then I would be High. But the description says \"leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.\" So the vulnerability itself doesn't directly allow code execution, but when combined with others. Therefore, the primary impact is confidentiality (High), and the integrity and availability might be None or Low. Wait, but the CVSS base metrics are based on the maximum possible impact. If the vulnerability can be used to cause a high impact on any of the three, then that's considered. However, since the code execution is a secondary effect, maybe the base score doesn't account for that. So I would be None. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The vulnerability is an information disclosure, which is a confidentiality issue. The code execution is a separate vulnerability. So for the base score, the primary impact is confidentiality (High), and the other impacts (integrity and availability) are None. So I would be None. But maybe the fact that it can be used to execute code implies that the integrity is affected. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Maybe I should check the CVSS documentation. According to the CVSS v3.1 guidelines, if the vulnerability can be used to cause a loss of integrity, even if it's not the primary impact, then I would be High. However, in this case, the code execution is a result of combining with other vulnerabilities, not the vulnerability itself. Therefore, the base score would not include that. So I would be None. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe the code execution is a possible outcome, so the integrity impact is High. But I think the base score is based on the direct impact of the vulnerability. Since the vulnerability itself is an information disclosure, the primary impact is confidentiality. The code execution is a secondary effect, so the base score would not include that. Therefore, I would be None. But I'm not sure. Let me check another angle. The CVSS base score considers the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. If the vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution, that's a high impact on integrity. However, the description says that the attacker needs to leverage this with other vulnerabilities. So the vulnerability itself doesn't directly allow code execution. Therefore, the base score would not include that. So I would be None. But maybe the fact that it's possible to execute code when combined with others is considered. However, the base score is for the vulnerability as described, not the potential combinations. So I think I should go with None for Integrity.\n\nAvailability (A) – the description doesn't mention any impact on availability, so A is None (N).\n\nWait, but the original CVE description says \"disclose sensitive information\" which is confidentiality. So C is High. I and A are None. But maybe the code execution could affect availability? No, the description doesn't mention that. So A is None.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but the user interaction is required, so UI is R. The scope is unchanged because the vulnerability is in the application itself, not affecting other components. So S is U.\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But wait, the initial thought was I might be High, but I'm not sure. Let me check again. The vulnerability allows information disclosure, which is C:H. The code execution is a secondary effect, so I and A are N. Therefore, the final vector is AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But I need to confirm if I is N or H. If the code execution is possible, even if it's a combination with other vulnerabilities, does that count? The CVSS base score is based on the vulnerability as described. The description says the vulnerability allows disclosure of information, and that it can be leveraged with other vulnerabilities to execute code. So the primary impact is confidentiality. The code execution is a separate vulnerability. Therefore, I and A are N. So the answer would be:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nSo the vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 2.3000000000000007, "success": true}

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick an admin user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Newsletters plugin for WordPress. The attack vector is via the \"to\" parameter, and it's due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The attacker doesn't need authentication, but they need to trick an admin user into clicking a link.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in a parameter that's passed through a URL (like a link), the attack can be done over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is about how complex the attack is. Reflected XSS usually requires the user to click a link, which is a simple action. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) refers to the level of access the attacker needs. The description says it's unauthenticated attackers, so PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is whether the user needs to interact. The attack requires the admin to click the link, so UI is Required (R). Wait, but the user interaction here is the admin's action. However, in CVSS, UI is about whether the user needs to be tricked into performing an action. Since the user (admin) must click the link, UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. Since the plugin is part of WordPress, and the attack is within the same application context, the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the attack is reflected, it's within the same application, so S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. For XSS, the main impact is on integrity and confidentiality. Since the attacker can inject scripts, they can steal session cookies (confidentiality) or manipulate the page (integrity).

Wait, but the UI was Required (R) because the user needs to click the link. Let me double-check that. Yes, the user interaction is required here. So the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. But wait, the example given in the problem had UI:N. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nIn the CVE description, the attack requires the admin to click a link. So the user interaction is required. Therefore, UI should be R. However, some sources might consider that the user interaction is not required if the attack is via a crafted link that the user is tricked into clicking. But according to CVSS guidelines, if the attack requires the user to perform an action (like clicking a link), then UI is Required (R). So I think UI:R is correct here.\n\nWait, but in some cases, like if the attack is via a malicious link that the user is tricked into clicking, the user interaction is required. So yes, UI:R. Therefore, the final vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. But I need to confirm the impact metrics again. Since the XSS can steal data (confidentiality) and inject scripts (integrity), both are high. Availability isn't affected. So C:H, I:H, A:N.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.9.6.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the EventON Pro plugin for WordPress. The issue is a missing capability check in a specific JavaScript file, allowing authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access (or higher) to inject arbitrary web scripts. These scripts execute when a user accesses the injected page. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.9.6.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject scripts through the web application. Since it's a web-based plugin, the attack vector is likely Network (N). The attacker doesn't need physical access or adjacent network access; they can exploit it over the internet.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description mentions that the attacker needs to be authenticated with Subscriber-level access. However, the exploit doesn't require complex steps. Since the capability check is missing, once authenticated, the attacker can inject the script. So, the attack complexity is Low (L). It's not something that requires multiple steps or specific conditions beyond authentication.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to be authenticated with Subscriber-level access. In CVSS terms, this is considered Low (L) because Subscriber is a lower privilege level, but it's not None. However, wait, the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). Since the attacker needs to be authenticated, even with low privileges, PR is Low. But wait, if the attacker needs to have some level of access, then PR is Low. If no privileges were needed, it would be N. Here, the attacker must be authenticated, so PR is Low.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability requires the attacker to have the user access the injected page. However, the user interaction is not required for the attack to be successful. The attacker injects the script, and when a user accesses the page, the script executes. But the user doesn't need to interact with the attack, like clicking a link. The script runs automatically when the page is accessed. So UI is None (N). Wait, but if the user has to view the page, does that count as user interaction? Hmm. In CVSS, UI is 'Required' if the user must perform an action, like clicking a link or opening a file. In this case, the user just accesses the page, which is a normal action. So maybe UI is None. But I need to check the definition. According to CVSS, UI is 'None' if no user interaction is required. If the attack requires the user to perform an action, it's 'Required'. Here, the user doesn't need to do anything specific beyond accessing the page, which is normal. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the plugin) that the attacker is interacting with. Since the attack is within the same security scope (the web application), the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed (C). Here, the attacker is modifying data within the same application, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows arbitrary script injection, which can lead to data leakage. For example, an attacker could steal session cookies or other sensitive data. So the impact on confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts, which can alter the content of the web pages. This directly impacts the integrity of the data, so Integrity is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The injection of scripts could potentially cause the web application to become unavailable, like through a DoS attack. However, the description doesn't mention availability issues. But since the attacker can inject scripts that might disrupt the service, it's possible. However, the primary impact here is on confidentiality and integrity. If the vulnerability doesn't directly affect availability, then A is None (N). But I need to be careful. The CVSS considers availability impact if the vulnerability can cause the system to be unavailable. Since the description doesn't mention that, maybe A is None. However, if the injected script could cause the server to crash or consume resources, but the description doesn't specify that. So I think A is None (N).\n\nWait, but the vulnerability allows arbitrary script injection. If the script is something that causes the server to crash or loop, then availability is impacted. However, the description doesn't mention that. The main issue is unauthorized modification (integrity) and potential data leakage (confidentiality). So I think A is None.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low) because the attacker needs Subscriber-level access, which is a low privilege.\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but earlier I thought PR was Low. Let me check again. The attacker needs to be authenticated with Subscriber-level access. In CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to have some level of access (even low), then PR is Low. If no privileges are needed, it's None. Since the attacker must be authenticated, PR is Low. So PR is L.\n\nYes, that's correct.

Because the attacker doesn't need to be physically present or adjacent; they can do this over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation. If the attacker can just upload a file without needing to perform complex steps, then the complexity is Low (L). The description says they can bypass the blacklist, which might be a simple step, so AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attackers are unauthenticated, so they don't need any privileges. Therefore, PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The exploit doesn't require any user interaction. The attacker can upload the file directly without needing a user to click a link or do anything. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the plugin) that's part of the WordPress site. Since the exploit doesn't change the scope (i.e., it's not affecting a different component or system), S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows uploading files that could lead to remote code execution. If RCE is possible, that could lead to unauthorized access to data, so Confidentiality impact is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, allowing arbitrary file uploads can corrupt data or inject malicious code, so Integrity impact is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): If the attacker can execute arbitrary code, they might cause a denial of service, but the primary impact here is more on confidentiality and integrity. However, the description doesn't mention availability issues directly. But since the vulnerability allows code execution, which could potentially disrupt services, but the main impact is on confidentiality and integrity. However, in CVSS, if the exploit can lead to a DoS, even if not the primary, it's considered. But the description doesn't mention availability, so maybe A is None (N). Wait, but the problem says that the attacker can upload files that may make remote code execution possible. If RCE is possible, that could lead to availability issues, but the primary impact here is more on confidentiality and integrity. However, the CVSS guidelines state that if the vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary code, then Availability is considered High. Wait, no. Let me check. The Availability metric is about the loss of availability. If the exploit can cause a DoS, then A is High. But in this case, the exploit allows code execution, which might not directly cause a DoS unless the attacker does something like crash the server. However, the description doesn't mention that. So maybe Availability is None (N). But I need to be careful here. Alternatively, if the vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution, which could be used to cause a DoS, but the primary impact is on confidentiality and integrity. However, the CVSS 3.1 guidelines for Availability: High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a complete loss of availability, such as a DoS. Since the description doesn't mention that, maybe A is None. But I'm a bit uncertain here. Let me think again. The vulnerability allows uploading files that could be executed, leading to RCE. If the attacker can execute code, they could potentially cause a DoS, but that's not the primary impact. The primary is the ability to execute arbitrary code, which affects confidentiality and integrity. So maybe Availability is None. But I need to check the CVSS guidelines. According to NIST, for Availability, High is when the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a complete loss of availability. If the exploit doesn't inherently cause that, then it's None. So in this case, since the exploit is about uploading files leading to RCE, but not necessarily causing a DoS, Availability is None (N).\n\nWait, but the problem says that the uploaded.phar files may make remote code execution possible. If the server is configured to handle.phar as PHP, then the attacker can execute code. That could allow them to do anything, including causing a DoS. However, the CVSS base score doesn't consider the potential for DoS unless the vulnerability directly allows it. Since the description doesn't mention availability impact, I think A is None. So the metrics would be:\n\nAV: N\nAC: L\nPR: N\nUI: N\nS: U\nC: H\nI: H\nA: N\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the Availability. Let me check another angle. The CVSS 3.1 base score calculation for Availability: if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a complete loss of availability, then A is High. If it's a partial loss, then Low. If not, then None. Since the vulnerability here is about uploading files that could be executed, but the availability impact isn't directly mentioned. Therefore, A is None.\n\nSo the final vector would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. But wait, the example given in the problem has A:H. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the description again.\n\nThe vulnerability allows arbitrary file uploads, which could lead to RCE. If the attacker can execute arbitrary code, that could allow them to cause a DoS, but the primary impact is on confidentiality and integrity. However, in CVSS, if the vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary code, then the Availability impact is considered High because the attacker can cause the system to be unavailable. Wait, no. The Availability metric is about the loss of availability. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause the system to be unavailable, then A is High. But in this case, the vulnerability allows the attacker to execute code, which could be used to cause a DoS, but that's not the direct impact. The direct impact is the ability to execute code, which affects confidentiality and integrity. Therefore, unless the vulnerability directly allows for a DoS, A is None. So I think A is None here.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Let me check the CVSS 3.1 guidelines again. According to the CVSS documentation, the Availability metric is High if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a complete loss of availability. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a partial loss, then Low. If not, then None. Since the vulnerability here is about uploading files that can be executed, but the availability impact isn't directly mentioned, I think A is None. Therefore, the correct metrics are as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.7000000000000011, "success": true}

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `editar_permissoes.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `msg_c` parameter. The application fails to validate and sanitize user inputs in the `msg_c` parameter. This lack of validation permits the injection of malicious payloads, which are reflected back to the user's browser in the server's response and executed within the context of the victim's browser. This issue has been addressed in release version 3.2.6. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Reflected XSS in the `editar_permissoes.php` endpoint, specifically in the `msg_c` parameter. The app doesn't validate or sanitize this input, leading to malicious scripts being reflected back to the user's browser.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in a web application and the attack is via a parameter in a URL, which can be accessed over the network, AV should be Network (N). That makes sense because the attacker doesn't need to be on the same network or physical location.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). Reflected XSS typically requires the user to be tricked into clicking a malicious link. The attacker needs to craft the payload and get the user to interact with it. However, the complexity here is low because the attack doesn't require any special conditions beyond the user visiting the malicious link. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). For XSS, the attacker doesn't need any prior authentication or privileges. The user is the one who's being targeted, so the attacker doesn't need to have any privileges on the system. Therefore, PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The attack requires the user to interact with the malicious link, like clicking on it. Without the user's action, the script won't execute. So UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component that's being attacked. Since the XSS is in the web application itself, the scope doesn't change. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). XSS can lead to stealing session cookies, which affects confidentiality. It can also inject malicious scripts that alter the page's content, affecting integrity. However, availability isn't directly impacted here. So C is High (H), I is High (H), and A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but I need to check if UI is Required or None. The description says the user has to click the link, so UI is Required. That's correct. So the final vector string should have UI:R.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the vulnerability described in the CVE. The issue is in the Linux kernel's media driver for Mediatek's vcodec. The problem occurs when trying to remove the module (rmmod mtk-vcodec-dec.ko) if the driver supports subdev mode. The parameter \"dev->pm.dev\" becomes NULL, leading to a kernel crash.\n\nSo, the vulnerability is a kernel crash when unloading the module under certain conditions. Now, I need to map this to the CVSS metrics.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel module, an attacker would need to have access to the system to trigger the removal of the module. However, the vulnerability is in the driver code, and the crash happens when the module is removed. But the attack vector here is probably local because the user is running the rmmod command, which requires root privileges. So AV is Local (L). Wait, but maybe it's possible to exploit this remotely? Hmm, the description doesn't mention any remote exploitation. The crash is when the module is removed, which is a local action. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is triggered by a specific action (rmmod) under a specific condition (subdev mode support). The attacker needs to know about the module and the condition. But the complexity is low because it's a straightforward action once the conditions are met. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): To remove a kernel module, the user needs root privileges. So PR is High (H), because the attacker must have administrative privileges. Wait, but if the module is being removed by the user, maybe the user has the necessary privileges. However, in the context of CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since the user needs to have root access to run rmmod, that's High. But wait, maybe the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit doesn't require any additional privileges beyond what's already needed to run the command. Hmm, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already in a privileged context (like root), then PR is None (N)? Wait, no. The PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have root access to trigger the vulnerability, then PR is High. But if the vulnerability can be exploited without any additional privileges, then PR is None. However, in this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit requires the user to have the ability to remove the module, which typically requires root. So PR is High (H). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. The PR metric is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have root access to perform the action (rmmod), then PR is High. If the vulnerability can be exploited without any privileges, then PR is None. Since the user must have root to run rmmod, PR is High. So PR: H.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered by the user running the rmmod command. So user interaction is required. Therefore, UI is Required (R). But wait, if the user is already in a privileged context, maybe the interaction is not required? No, the UI metric is about whether the user needs to interact with the system for the attack to succeed. Since the user has to run the command, UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component as the affected system. So the scope is Unchanged (U). Because the vulnerability doesn't affect a different component or scope beyond the original system.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability causes a kernel crash, which is an availability issue. The system becomes unavailable. There's no mention of data leakage (confidentiality) or data corruption (integrity). So C: N, I: N, A: H (High) because the system crashes, which is a high impact on availability.\n\nWait, but the crash is a denial of service. So Availability is High. But the CVSS metrics for availability: High (H) is when the vulnerability results in a complete loss of availability, such as a system crash. So A: H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: H (High)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nNow, the CVSS vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nWait, but I need to check if the Attack Vector is correct. The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attack is local. So AV is Local (L). But sometimes, kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger them. However, in this case, the vulnerability is triggered by a local action (rmmod), so AV is Local. So that's correct.\n\nAnother point: the PR is High because the attacker needs to have root privileges to remove the module. So PR: H. But if the attacker is already in a privileged context, maybe PR is None? Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have root access to perform the action, then PR is High. If the vulnerability can be exploited without any privileges, then PR is None. Since the user must have root to run rmmod, PR is High. So that's correct.\n\nSo the final vector string is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.2999999999999998, "success": true}

Improper output encoding in the snipper viewer functionality lead to Cross-Site scripting attacks.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. The CVE is about a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in GitLab's snipper viewer due to improper output encoding. \n\nFirst, I need to determine each metric. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the issue is in the snipper viewer functionality, which is likely accessible via the web. Since XSS typically requires the attacker to get the victim to visit a malicious link, the attack vector is probably Network (N), as it's over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. XSS vulnerabilities often require low complexity because they might just involve injecting a script into a page. So I'll go with Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) – for XSS, the attacker doesn't need any special privileges. The user just needs to be tricked into visiting the page. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) – XSS usually requires the user to interact, like clicking a link or visiting a page. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but some XSS can be reflected without user interaction? Hmm, but in this case, the snipper viewer might be part of the application where the user is already logged in. Wait, but the vulnerability is due to improper output encoding, which could be a reflected or stored XSS. If it's stored, maybe the user doesn't need to interact, but the description doesn't specify. However, the general case for XSS is that user interaction is required, so I'll stick with Required (R).\n\nScope (S) – the vulnerability affects the same component where the user is interacting, so the scope is Unchanged (U). If it's a different component, it would be Changed, but here it's within the same application context.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) – XSS can lead to data theft (C: High), data modification (I: High), and maybe denial of service if the script is malicious, but the primary impact here is on confidentiality and integrity. However, the description doesn't mention availability issues, so A is None (N). But wait, the vulnerability is XSS, which typically affects confidentiality and integrity. So C and I would be High, and A is None.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the UI might be None if the attack doesn't require user interaction. Wait, the user has to interact with the page to trigger the XSS. For example, if the attacker sends a link to the user, the user has to click it. So UI is Required (R). But some sources say that for XSS, UI is None if it's a stored XSS, but if it's reflected, then UI is Required. The description says \"improper output encoding in the snipper viewer functionality lead to Cross-Site scripting attacks.\" Without more details, I think the safest assumption is that user interaction is required, hence UI:R. However, I might be wrong here. Let me check. In CVSS, for XSS, if the attack requires the user to interact (like visiting a malicious link), then UI is Required. If the attack is stored (like in a database), then UI might be None. But the description doesn't specify. Hmm. Maybe the default is UI:R unless it's a stored XSS. Since the description doesn't specify, I'll go with UI:R.\n\nSo the final vector would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but the availability is None. Let me confirm again. The vulnerability is XSS, which doesn't directly impact availability. So A is N. So the vector is AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. But I need to check if the UI is correct. If the attack is a reflected XSS, then the user must interact. If it's stored, maybe not. But without more info, I think UI:R is correct here.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Ebook Downloader plugin for WordPress, allowing SQL injection through the 'download' parameter. It's due to insufficient escaping and lack of prepared statements. The attacker is unauthenticated and can extract sensitive info.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description says it's possible for unauthenticated attackers to exploit this. Since the attack can be done remotely without needing physical access or being on the same network, AV should be Network (N). \n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. SQL injection typically requires crafting a specific payload, but if the vulnerability is straightforward, like a simple injection point, it might be Low. However, if it's complex, maybe High. The description mentions \"insufficient escaping\" and \"lack of sufficient preparation,\" which might imply that the attack is not too complex. So I'll go with Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is about what the attacker needs. The attacker is unauthenticated, so they don't need any privileges. That makes PR None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) refers to whether the user needs to interact. Since the attack is via a parameter in a request, it's likely that no user interaction is needed. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. Since the plugin is part of WordPress, and the attack is on the plugin's own code, the scope is Unchanged (U). If it affected another component, it would be Changed, but here it's the same component.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. The vulnerability allows extraction of sensitive information, so Confidentiality is High (H). Integrity and Availability aren't mentioned, but since the attack is SQL injection, it could potentially alter data (Integrity) or cause denial of service (Availability). However, the description only mentions extracting info, so maybe Integrity and Availability are None. Wait, but the problem says \"extract sensitive information,\" which affects confidentiality. The other two might not be impacted unless the attack can modify data or disrupt service. Since the description doesn't mention those, I think C is H, I and A are N. But wait, sometimes SQL injection can be used to modify data, but the description doesn't specify that. The user might have to infer based on the given info. Since the exploit is for extracting data, maybe only confidentiality is affected. So C=H, I=N, A=N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Wait, but the example in the problem had all three impact metrics as H. Let me check again. The CVE says \"extract sensitive information from the database,\" which is a confidentiality impact. The problem doesn't mention integrity or availability being affected. So I and A would be N. But sometimes, even if the primary impact is confidentiality, the other metrics might be considered. However, according to the CVSS guidelines, each impact metric is evaluated based on the vulnerability's effect. Since the exploit allows data extraction, confidentiality is high. If the attack could also modify data (integrity) or cause downtime (availability), those would be high. But the description doesn't mention that. So I and A are N. Therefore, the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Wait, but the example in the problem had all three as H. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The SQL injection could allow an attacker to read data (confidentiality), but could they also write data (integrity) or delete data (availability)? The description says \"extract sensitive information,\" which is confidentiality. If the attacker can inject arbitrary SQL, they might be able to modify or delete data, but the description doesn't specify that. So unless the vulnerability allows for that, the impact metrics for integrity and availability would be None. Therefore, the correct values are C:H, I:N, A:N. So the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But wait, the example given in the problem's final line had all three as H. Maybe I need to check if the vulnerability could affect all three. However, the problem's example is just an example, not the actual answer. So based on the given CVE description, only confidentiality is impacted. Therefore, the answer should have C:H, I:N, A:N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

The CVE is about a Reflected XSS vulnerability in a WordPress plugin. First, I need to recall the CVSS v3.1 metrics and how they apply here.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions it's a Reflected XSS, which typically requires the user to click on a malicious link. Since the attack is delivered via a web page, the vector is Network (N). So AV is N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. Reflected XSS usually doesn't require complex steps. The attacker just needs to trick the user into clicking a link with the payload. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) – for XSS, the attacker doesn't need any special privileges. The user's browser is the target, so PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) – Reflected XSS requires the user to interact, like clicking a link. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but some might argue that if it's a reflected XSS, maybe the user has to interact. Yes, that's correct. So UI is R.\n\nScope (S) – The vulnerability is in the web application, and the impact is on the same application. So the scope is Unchanged (U). Unless the vulnerability allows access to other components, but here it's just the same app. So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A) – XSS can lead to data theft (C: High), data manipulation (I: High), and maybe denial of service if the script is malicious, but the primary impact here is on confidentiality and integrity. However, the description doesn't mention availability issues. So C and I are High, A is None. Wait, but the standard for XSS is usually C and I as High, and A as None unless the attack can cause DoS. Since the CVE only mentions XSS, which is about injecting scripts, the main impacts are confidentiality and integrity. So C: H, I: H, A: N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Then the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is an OS Command injection (CWE-78) in Fortinet FortiSandbox versions mentioned. The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least read-only permissions to execute unauthorized commands via crafted requests.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attacker can execute commands via crafted requests. Since it's about network-based attacks (like HTTP requests), AV is likely Network (N). If it required physical access, it would be P, but here it's through the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization, which might be straightforward to exploit. If the attacker just needs to send a specific crafted request without complex steps, AC is Low (L). If it required multiple steps or specific conditions, it would be High, but the description doesn't mention that, so I'll go with L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs at least read-only permissions. In CVSS, if the attacker needs some level of privilege, even if it's low, it's considered Low (L). However, the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). Wait, the attacker must be authenticated with read-only access. So they need some privileges, but not high. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but the options for PR are N, L, H. If the attacker needs to have some privileges, even if minimal, then PR is Low. If no privileges are needed, it's N. Here, the attacker needs read-only, so PR is L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says the attacker can execute commands via crafted requests. If user interaction is required, like a user clicking a link, then UI is R. But if the attack can be done without user interaction, like a remote exploit, then UI is N. The description doesn't mention needing user interaction, so UI is N.\n\nScope (S): This is about whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). Since the vulnerability is in the FortiSandbox itself, and the attack is against the same system, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to another component, it would be Changed, but here it's the same system, so S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability allows execution of unauthorized commands. This can lead to unauthorized access to data (C), modification of data (I), and disruption of service (A). Since the attacker can execute commands, they can potentially read, modify, or disrupt the system. So all three are High (H). For example, if the attacker can run arbitrary commands, they can read files (C), alter configurations (I), or stop services (A). Therefore, C, I, A are all H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: H (High)\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.

If the attacker needs to have some privileges (even if low), then PR is Low. If no privileges are needed, it's None.

This vulnerability allows authenticated users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation for the given CVE. First, I need to understand the vulnerability described. The CVE is about a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IBM QRadar SIEM. The key points here are that it's a stored XSS, which means the malicious script is stored on the server and executed when another user views the affected page. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to embed arbitrary JavaScript, which can alter functionality and lead to credential disclosure in a trusted session.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the Web UI, and since it's a stored XSS, the attack can be initiated through the network. The attacker doesn't need to be physically present or adjacent. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Stored XSS typically requires the attacker to inject the script into the application, which might involve some level of manipulation. However, if the vulnerability is easy to exploit once the attacker has access, then AC is Low (L). Since the user is authenticated, but the attack is straightforward once they can inject the script, I think AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user needs to be authenticated to exploit this. The description says \"authenticated users,\" so the attacker must have some level of privilege. But since the user is already authenticated, the required privileges are Low (L) or None? Wait, PR is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the user is already authenticated, then the attacker needs to have the same privileges as the user. But the vulnerability is in the Web UI, so maybe the attacker needs to be authenticated, which would be Low (L) or maybe High? Wait, the options are None, Low, High. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a low level of privilege. Because High would be like needing admin rights. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but the user is authenticated, so the attacker must have the same privileges as the user. But the original user might have low privileges. Hmm, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since the attacker is an authenticated user, they need to have the same privileges as the user. But the vulnerability is in the Web UI, so maybe the attacker doesn't need any additional privileges beyond being authenticated. So PR is Low (L) because the user is authenticated, but not necessarily admin. Alternatively, if the user is authenticated, maybe that's considered as requiring some privileges, but in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is an authenticated user, then the required privileges are Low (L) because they don't need administrative access. So PR is Low.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Stored XSS doesn't require user interaction. The script is stored and executed when another user views the page. So UI is None (N). Because the user doesn't need to interact with the malicious script; it's automatically executed when the page is loaded.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the Web UI) that the user is interacting with. Since the attack is within the same security scope (the application's UI), the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same application.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows for credentials disclosure. So the confidentiality impact is High (H) because the attacker can steal sensitive information like credentials.\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can alter the functionality by injecting JavaScript. This could lead to data modification or manipulation, so Integrity impact is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The description doesn't mention any impact on availability. The main issue is confidentiality and integrity. So Availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but earlier I thought PR might be Low. Let me double-check. The user is authenticated, so the attacker needs to be authenticated. In CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered as requiring Low privileges. Because High would be like needing admin rights. So PR is Low (L). So the vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the PlayEdu system, specifically in the User Avatar Handler component's /api/backend/v1/user/create endpoint. The issue is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) due to the manipulation of the Avatar argument. The attack can be initiated remotely, and the exploit is public.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attack can be initiated remotely, which typically means over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. SSRF usually requires some level of user input manipulation, but if the vulnerability is straightforward, like sending a crafted request without needing complex steps, AC would be Low (L). Since the exploit is public and the attack is initiated remotely without complex steps, I think AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) refers to the level of access needed to exploit the vulnerability. Since the attack is initiated remotely and the user doesn't need any special privileges (like admin rights), PR is None (N). The user just needs to send a request to the vulnerable endpoint.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is about whether the user needs to interact for the attack to succeed. The description doesn't mention any user interaction being required, so UI is None (N). The attack is automated via the API.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) if the vulnerability affects the same component that's being attacked. Since the SSRF is in the User Avatar Handler component, which is part of the same system, the scope doesn't change. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. SSRF can lead to unauthorized access to internal resources (like reading files from the server), which affects confidentiality. It can also allow modifying internal resources, affecting integrity. If the SSRF can cause the server to perform actions that disrupt services, it might affect availability. However, the description doesn't specify availability impact. But since SSRF can be used to access internal systems, which could lead to data leakage (C: High) and potential data modification (I: High). Availability might not be directly impacted unless the attack causes a denial of service, which isn't mentioned here. So I'll go with C: High, I: High, A: None.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the user might have to interact if the attack requires a user to click a link, but the description says the attack is initiated remotely, which might not require user interaction.

This can lead to unauthorized access to internal servers and potentially expose sensitive information, including access to the AWS metadata endpoint.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the Dify version 0.9.1. The issue is with the api_endpoint parameter not being handled properly, allowing attackers to make requests to internal services. This can lead to unauthorized access to internal servers and exposure of sensitive info, like the AWS metadata endpoint.\n\nAlright, starting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is SSRF, the attacker can send a request to the server, which then makes a request to an internal service. The attack doesn't require physical access or being adjacent. It's over the network, so AV should be Network (N).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says the attacker can exploit this by making a request to the server with a crafted api_endpoint. That seems straightforward, so AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker doesn't need any special privileges to exploit this. They just need to send a request to the server. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability doesn't require any user interaction. The attacker can exploit it without needing the user to do anything. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component that's being attacked. Since the server is making the internal request, the scope isn't changed. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C). The vulnerability allows access to internal servers and sensitive information, so Confidentiality is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I). The attacker could potentially modify internal services, but the description mentions unauthorized access and exposure, not necessarily modifying data. However, since the attack can lead to unauthorized access, which might include modifying data, but the primary impact here is on confidentiality. Wait, the problem says \"expose sensitive information\" which is confidentiality. But maybe integrity could be High if the attacker can alter data. Hmm, the description doesn't mention integrity impact, but the SSRF could allow reading internal resources, which is confidentiality. So maybe I is Low or None. Wait, the CVSS guidelines: if the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data, that's confidentiality. If they can modify, that's integrity. Since the description says \"expose sensitive information\", that's confidentiality. So I might be None or Low. But the problem says \"unauthorized access to internal servers and potentially expose sensitive information, including access to the AWS metadata endpoint.\" So the main impact is confidentiality. So I might be None. But I need to check. The CVSS 3.1 base metrics: if the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data, that's confidentiality. If they can modify, that's integrity. If they can cause a denial of service, that's availability. Since the description doesn't mention modifying data or causing a DoS, but just unauthorized access and exposure, I think C is High, I is None, A is None. Wait, but the problem says \"expose sensitive information\" which is confidentiality. So C is High. Integrity and Availability are not mentioned, so they are None. But wait, the CVSS base metrics require that if the vulnerability can impact any of the three (C, I, A), you have to assign a value. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data, that's C: High. If they can modify, that's I: High. If they can cause a DoS, that's A: High. Since the description doesn't mention modifying data or causing a DoS, but just unauthorized access (reading), then C is High, I and A are None. But wait, the problem says \"unauthorized access to internal servers and potentially expose sensitive information, including access to the AWS metadata endpoint.\" So the main impact is confidentiality. So C is High. I and A are None. But I need to check if the SSRF could also allow modifying data. For example, if the attacker can make the server send a request to an internal service that modifies data, but the description doesn't mention that. So I think I is None. Similarly, A is None unless the attack causes a DoS, which isn't mentioned. So the metrics would be C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nWait, but the CVSS 3.1 base score calculation for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data, that's C: High. If the attacker can modify data, that's I: High. If the attacker can cause a DoS, that's A: High. Since the description only mentions unauthorized access and exposure of data, which is confidentiality, then C is High. The other two are None.

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `tags.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `msg_e` parameter. The application fails to validate and sanitize user inputs in the `msg_e` parameter. This lack of validation permits the injection of malicious payloads, which are reflected back to the user's browser in the server's response and executed within the context of the victim's browser. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.6. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Reflected XSS in the `tags.php` endpoint of WeGIA, specifically in the `msg_e` parameter. The app doesn't validate or sanitize user inputs here, allowing malicious scripts to be injected and reflected back to the user's browser.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in a web application and the attack is via a parameter in a URL (reflected XSS), the attack can be initiated over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. Reflected XSS typically requires the attacker to trick the user into clicking a malicious link. This might be considered low complexity because the attacker just needs to craft a URL with the malicious payload. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) for XSS vulnerabilities usually don't require any user privileges. The attacker doesn't need to have any special access; they just need the user to visit the malicious link. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is Required (R) because the user has to click on the malicious link for the XSS to execute. Without user interaction, the attack wouldn't work here.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability exists in the same component (the web application) and doesn't affect other components or systems. The scope isn't changed.\n\nConfidentiality (C) is High (H) because XSS can steal session cookies or other sensitive data, leading to unauthorized access. Integrity (I) is also High (H) because the attacker can inject scripts to alter the content or perform actions on behalf of the user. Availability (A) is Low (L) because XSS typically doesn't cause a denial of service, but maybe in some cases, but the primary impact here is on confidentiality and integrity. Wait, but the description doesn't mention availability issues. So maybe A is None (N)? Hmm, but the standard for XSS is usually C and I as High, and A as None. Let me check that again. The vulnerability allows script injection, which can lead to data theft (C) and data manipulation (I), but not necessarily making the service unavailable. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Then the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.

This leads to less restrictive CORS policies being applied to sensitive endpoints, allowing unauthorized cross-origin access.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability allows unauthorized cross-origin access, which typically implies that the attack can be initiated from a remote network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The description mentions that the vulnerability is due to a specific flaw in how regex patterns are prioritized. Exploiting this might not require complex steps, so AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) refers to the level of access needed to exploit the vulnerability.

Hmm, but the primary impact is on confidentiality and integrity. The availability impact isn't clearly stated, so maybe it's None. But I need to check the CVSS guidelines. If the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to data, that's confidentiality. If it allows unauthorized modification, that's integrity. Availability would be if the attack causes the service to be unavailable. Since the description doesn't mention that, I think A is None (N).

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Dell Client Platform BIOS, where the Security Version Number is mutable to older versions. A high-privileged attacker with local access could exploit this to deny a BIOS upgrade.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions a \"high privileged attacker with local access.\" Local access typically means the attack doesn't require network access. So AV should be Local (L). But wait, sometimes local might be adjacent if it's on the same network, but here it's specifically local access, so AV is L.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability requires specific conditions. The attacker needs to have high privileges and local access. Since it's not a simple exploit, maybe AC is High (H)? But wait, if the attack is straightforward once the attacker has local access, maybe it's Low. Hmm. The description says \"could potentially exploit,\" which might imply that it's not trivial. But I'm not sure. Maybe AC is Low because the attacker just needs to manipulate the version number once they have access. I'll go with Low (L) for AC.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR).

This issue affects Plugin A/B Image Optimizer: from n/a through 3.3.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. The CVE is about a Path Traversal vulnerability in the Zach Swetz Plugin A/B Image Optimizer. The description says it allows Path Traversal and affects versions up to 3.3.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). Path Traversal vulnerabilities are typically exploited over a network, like through a web application. So AV is probably Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) – if the attack requires minimal steps, like just a specific path in the URL, that's Low (L). If it's complex, like needing specific conditions, it's High. Since path traversal is often low complexity, I'll go with L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) – If the attacker doesn't need any special privileges, like just a regular user accessing a URL, then it's None (N). If it requires admin rights, it's High. The description doesn't mention needing elevated privileges, so PR is N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) – If the attack requires the user to click a link or interact, it's Required (R). If it's automatic, like a server-side issue, it's None. Path traversal usually doesn't need user interaction, so UI is N.\n\nScope (S) – If the vulnerability affects the same component that's attacked, it's Unchanged (U). If it affects other components, it's Changed (C). Since this is a plugin vulnerability, maybe it's in the same scope. But I'm not sure. Wait, the plugin is part of a larger system, but the vulnerability is within the plugin itself. So the scope might be Unchanged. Hmm, maybe S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A) – These are the impact metrics. Path traversal can allow reading files, which affects confidentiality (C:H). It can also modify files, affecting integrity (I:H). If the attack can delete or disrupt files, that's availability (A:H). But the description doesn't mention availability. However, path traversal can lead to reading or writing files, which would impact confidentiality and integrity. So C:H, I:H, A:N? Wait, but if the attack can overwrite files, that's integrity. But the original description says \"Path Traversal\" which is usually about reading files, not modifying. So maybe A is N. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check. Path traversal typically allows access to files outside the intended directory, which could read sensitive data (C:H) and possibly overwrite files if the server allows writing, but that's less common. So maybe I:H if the attack can modify files. But the original description doesn't specify. Hmm. The default for impact metrics is N unless the vulnerability can be exploited to affect those. Since the vulnerability is a path traversal, which is about accessing files, the main impact is confidentiality. Integrity might be H if the attacker can write to files, but that's not always the case. The description doesn't mention that, so maybe I:N. Wait, but the CVSS guidelines say that if the vulnerability can be used to modify data, then I:H. If it's just reading, then C:H. So in this case, since it's a path traversal, the primary impact is confidentiality. So C:H, I:N, A:N. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The vulnerability allows path traversal, which could allow an attacker to read files outside the intended directory. That's a confidentiality issue. If the attacker can write to those files, that's integrity. But the description doesn't mention writing, just traversal. So maybe I:N. Availability is about disrupting the service, which isn't mentioned here. So A:N. But I'm not sure. Maybe the impact metrics are C:H, I:L, A:N? Wait, the CVSS v3.1 impact metrics are based on whether the vulnerability can be exploited to affect confidentiality, integrity, or availability. If the vulnerability allows reading files, that's a high impact on confidentiality. If it allows writing, that's high on integrity. If it allows deletion, that's high on availability. Since the description only mentions path traversal, which is typically about reading, I think C:H, I:N, A:N. But I need to be careful here. Alternatively, maybe the integrity is low if the attacker can overwrite files, but that's not specified. The original description doesn't mention that, so I'll go with C:H, I:N, A:N. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me check the CVSS guidelines again. The impact metrics are determined by the potential damage. If the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to data, that's confidentiality. If it allows unauthorized modification, that's integrity. If it allows denial of service, that's availability. Since the vulnerability is path traversal, which is about accessing files, the main impact is confidentiality. So C:H, I:N, A:N. \n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Wait, but the Scope (S) – if the vulnerability is in a plugin, and the attack affects the same component, then S:U. If the attack affects other components, it's C. But I think in this case, the plugin is part of the system, and the vulnerability is within the plugin's scope, so S:U. \n\nSo the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. But wait, the user interaction is None (N) because the attack doesn't require user interaction. The attack vector is network, attack complexity low, privileges required none, user interaction none, scope unchanged, confidentiality high, integrity none, availability none. \n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure about the impact metrics. Let me check another angle. If the vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files, that's a high confidentiality impact. If they can't modify or delete, then integrity and availability are none. So yes, C:H, I:N, A:N. \n\nSo the final vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 2.3000000000000007, "success": true}

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of MedDream PACS Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

Not all drivers implement that callback, leading to NULL dereferences. Example of affected drivers: ptp_s390.c, ptp_vclock.c and ptp_mock.c. Instead use a dummy callback if no better was specified by the driver.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the ptp (Precision Time Protocol) module. The issue is that the ioctl and sysfs handlers call the ->enable callback unconditionally, but not all drivers implement this callback. This can lead to NULL dereferences, which are serious because they can cause the system to crash or become unstable.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since the kernel is a core component, and the issue is related to system calls (ioctl and sysfs), which are accessible over the network or locally. However, the description doesn't mention any specific network exposure. But in general, kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger the vulnerable code from user space. However, since the problem is with drivers that might not implement the callback, maybe an attacker would need to have access to the system to exploit this. But I'm not sure. Wait, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so if an attacker can execute code that triggers the ioctl or sysfs handlers, which are typically local system calls. So maybe the attack vector is Local (L). But wait, if the system is exposed to a network, maybe through some service that uses these drivers, but the description doesn't specify. Hmm. Alternatively, since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attack requires local access to exploit it (like through a local user triggering the ioctl), then AV would be Local (L). But I need to check if there's a way to exploit this remotely. The description doesn't mention that, so I think AV is Local (L). But wait, some kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger them via network services. However, without more info, I think the safest assumption is Local (L) because the drivers are part of the kernel and the exploit would require local access to the system.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a NULL dereference. To exploit this, the attacker would need to trigger the ->enable callback when it's not implemented. This might require specific conditions, like sending a specific ioctl command or accessing a sysfs entry. However, if the attacker can do that, the exploit is straightforward. So the attack complexity is Low (L) because it doesn't require complex steps beyond triggering the vulnerable code.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the ioctl/sysfs handlers are typically called by processes with certain privileges. For example, if the driver is part of a device that requires root access, then the attacker would need high privileges. However, if the driver is accessible to regular users, then maybe low or none. But in the Linux kernel, sysfs is usually accessible to users, but the actual exploitation might require root privileges to perform certain operations. Wait, the vulnerability is a NULL dereference, which could lead to a crash, but to exploit it for arbitrary code execution, the attacker might need to have some level of privilege. However, the original problem is that the callback isn't implemented, leading to a crash. If the attacker can trigger this, maybe they can cause a denial of service. But if the attacker can do that without elevated privileges, then PR would be None (N). However, if the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system (like being a local user), then PR might be Low (L) or None (N). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attack vector is local, but the attacker doesn't need any special privileges beyond being a local user, which is typically allowed. So PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to have elevated privileges to exploit it. Wait, but if the attacker is a regular user, can they trigger the ioctl or sysfs handlers? For example, if the driver is accessible via sysfs, which is usually readable by all users, but writing might require root. However, the vulnerability is in the code that's called when the handler is invoked. If the attacker can send a command that triggers the handler, they might need to have the necessary permissions. But the description doesn't specify, so I think PR is None (N) because the vulnerability is in the kernel and can be exploited by a local user without needing elevated privileges. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe I should go with PR: None (N) because the attack doesn't require any specific privileges beyond being a local user, which is the default.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered by the system's own operations, like when a user or process interacts with the sysfs or uses an ioctl. However, the description doesn't mention that user interaction is required. If the vulnerability can be triggered automatically without user interaction, then UI is None (N). But if the attacker needs the user to perform an action, like opening a file or running a program, then UI is Required (R). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and can be triggered by any process that uses the affected drivers, it's possible that the attack doesn't require user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component as the affected drivers. Since the vulnerability doesn't change the scope (i.e., it's within the same component), S is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affected a different component, like a library or another system, then S would be Changed (C). But here, it's within the kernel, so S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability is a NULL dereference, which can lead to a crash (availability), but not necessarily a breach of confidentiality or integrity. However, if the crash can be exploited to cause a denial of service, then Availability is High (H). But if the vulnerability doesn't allow for data leakage or modification, then C and I are None (N). However, the description says that the vulnerability leads to NULL dereferences, which can cause the system to crash or become unstable. So the impact on availability is High (H). But the impact on confidentiality and integrity is None (N) because there's no indication that the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to data or modification of data. Therefore, C: N, I: N, A: H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nNow, the CVSS vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nWait, but I need to check if the attack vector is actually Local. Let me think again. If the vulnerability is in the kernel and can be triggered by a local user, then AV is Local. However, if the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, then AV would be Network. But the description doesn't mention any remote exploitation. The drivers are part of the kernel, and the attack would require local access to the system. So AV is Local (L). Therefore, the vector string is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.7000000000000002, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The issue is in GitLab EE where authenticated project owners could bypass group-level forking restrictions by manipulating API requests. The affected versions are specified, but the key part is the vulnerability itself.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability allows authenticated users to exploit it. Since it's through API requests, which are typically accessed over the network, AV is likely Network (N). Unless there's a local or physical component, but the description doesn't mention that. So AV=N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The vulnerability requires manipulating API requests. If it's straightforward, like sending a specific request without much complexity, then AC is Low (L). If it's complex, like needing specific conditions or multiple steps, it's High. The description says \"manipulating API requests,\" which might be a simple exploit, so AC=L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to be an authenticated project owner. That's a specific privilege, but the question is whether it's considered Low, High, or None. Since the user is already authenticated with certain privileges (project owner), but the vulnerability allows them to bypass restrictions, maybe PR is Low (L) because they need some level of access but not necessarily high privileges. Wait, but the user is already authenticated as a project owner, which is a privilege. However, in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated as a project owner, that's a privilege, but the question is whether that's considered Low, High, or None. The options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). Since the attacker needs to have some privileges (project owner), but not necessarily administrative, maybe PR is Low (L). Alternatively, if the attacker needs to have a specific role, that might be considered Low. I think PR=L here.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is whether the user needs to interact for the attack to succeed. The description says \"manipulating API requests,\" which could be done without user interaction. If the attacker can send the request without the user's knowledge, then UI= None (N). If the user has to click a link or something, it's Required (R). Since it's an API request, likely automated, so UI=N.\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different one (Changed). The vulnerability is in GitLab EE, and the attack is within the same system, so S=Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. The vulnerability allows bypassing group-level forking restrictions. Forking a group might involve accessing data (confidentiality), modifying data (integrity), or disrupting availability. However, the main impact here is that the attacker can bypass restrictions, which could lead to unauthorized access to repositories (confidentiality), or allowing unauthorized changes (integrity). Availability might not be directly affected unless the forking causes a denial of service, which isn't mentioned. So, C=High (H) because bypassing restrictions could lead to unauthorized access to confidential data. I=High (H) because forking might allow modifying data. A=Low (L) or None (N) if availability isn't impacted. But the description doesn't mention availability issues, so A=N. Wait, but maybe the ability to fork could lead to resource exhaustion? Not sure. The original description doesn't mention availability, so I think A=N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV=N, AC=L, PR=L, UI=N, S=U, C=H, I=H, A=N.\n\nWait, but the Privileges Required might be considered as Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated as a project owner, which is a specific privilege. However, in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to have a certain role (like project owner), that's considered Low. If they needed admin rights, that's High. So PR=L.\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but the original problem says the user is authenticated, so PR is not None. So PR is Low (L) because they need some privileges but not high.

This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via remote network.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in ollama/ollama versions up to 0.3.14. A malicious user can create a customized GGUF model file that, when uploaded to the Ollama server, causes a crash due to an unchecked null pointer dereference. This leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via remote network.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions a remote network attack, so AV should be Network (N). That's straightforward.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is due to an unchecked null pointer dereference. This seems like a simple condition that can be exploited without much complexity. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The user needs to upload the model file. If the system allows any user to upload files without authentication, then PR would be None (N). But if the user needs some level of access, maybe Low. However, the description says \"malicious user\" which might imply they have some access, but since it's a DoS via remote network, maybe they don't need any privileges. Wait, but if the server is open to the internet, maybe the user doesn't need any privileges. Hmm. But I need to check. If the server is configured to accept uploads from any user, then PR is None. If it requires authentication, then PR would be Low or High. The description doesn't specify, but since it's a remote DoS, I think PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any special privileges beyond what's allowed by the service.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The attack requires the user to upload the file. So does that require user interaction? If the user has to interact with the system to upload the file, then UI is Required (R). But if the attack can be triggered automatically without user action, then it's None. The description says \"malicious user to create a customized GGUF model file that, when uploaded...\" So the user has to perform the upload. Therefore, UI is Required (R). Wait, but the user interaction here is the attacker's action. However, in CVSS, UI refers to whether the attack requires the user to interact with the system. If the attacker needs to trick a user into opening a file, that's Required. But in this case, the attacker is uploading the file themselves. So maybe UI is None? Wait, no. The user interaction here is the attacker's action. But in CVSS, UI is about whether the attack requires the user to interact with the system. If the attack can be triggered without any user interaction, like a remote exploit, then UI is None. But if the attacker needs to convince a user to open a file, then it's Required. In this case, the attacker is uploading the file themselves, which might be part of their attack vector. However, the server is accepting the upload, so the user (attacker) is initiating the upload. But in terms of the system's perspective, does the attack require user interaction? I think in this case, the attack doesn't require user interaction from a legitimate user. The attacker is the one performing the action. So UI would be None (N). Wait, but the CVSS UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be executed without any user interaction (like a remote exploit), then UI is None. If the attack requires the user to perform an action (like clicking a link), then it's Required. Here, the attacker is the one uploading the file, which is their own action. So the system doesn't require any user interaction from a legitimate user. Therefore, UI is None (N). Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the definition again. UI: None (N) if the attack does not require any interaction with the user. Required (R) if the attack requires the user to interact with the system. In this case, the attacker is the one interacting with the system by uploading the file. But the system doesn't require a user to interact. So the attack doesn't require user interaction from a legitimate user. Therefore, UI is None (N). So I think UI is N.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U) if the vulnerability affects the same security scope as the vulnerable component. Changed (C) if it affects a different security scope. Since the vulnerability is in the Ollama server, and the attack is against the same component, S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability leads to a DoS, not data exposure. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the attack doesn't affect data integrity. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The attack causes a DoS, so A is High (H) because the vulnerability results in a complete loss of availability.\n\nWait, but the CVSS v3.1 metrics for Availability: High (H) if the vulnerability results in a complete loss of availability, Low (L) if partial, and None (N) if no impact. Since the DoS is a complete crash, leading to unavailability, A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought UI might be R. Let me recheck. The user interaction is whether the attack requires the user to interact with the system. If the attacker has to upload the file, which is their own action, then the system doesn't require user interaction. So UI is None. Therefore, the answer should have UI:N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

The vulnerability is in the Simple Downloads List plugin for WordPress, specifically an SQL injection through the 'category' attribute of the 'neofix_sdl' shortcode. The issue is due to insufficient escaping of user-supplied parameters and lack of proper SQL query preparation. The attacker needs to be authenticated with Contributor-level access or higher to exploit this.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is exploited via a shortcode parameter, which is typically processed through the web application. Since the attacker doesn't need physical access or adjacent network access, AV is likely Network (N). \n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. SQL injection usually requires specific input to inject malicious queries. However, if the vulnerability is straightforward, like a direct parameter injection without complex conditions, AC might be Low (L). The description mentions \"insufficient escaping\" and \"lack of sufficient preparation,\" which suggests that the exploit is not complex. So AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR).

However, the vulnerability allows them to extract sensitive info. Since the attacker needs some level of access, PR is Low (L). Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H).

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract sensitive private, pending, scheduled, and draft template data.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Jeg Elementor Kit plugin for WordPress, allowing authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access or higher to extract sensitive data like private, pending, scheduled, and draft templates. \n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the attacker needs to be authenticated. Since the attack is through the plugin's functions, which are likely accessed via the web, the attack vector is probably Network (N). Because even though authentication is required, the initial access is over the network.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability allows extraction of data once authenticated. If the attacker just needs to be authenticated and doesn't need to perform complex steps, then AC is Low (L). The description doesn't mention any specific complexity, so assuming it's straightforward once authenticated.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs Contributor-level access. In WordPress, Contributor has some privileges but not admin. However, the CVSS PR metric considers the level of privileges needed. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated with a certain role, but not necessarily high privileges, but the options are None, Low, High. Wait, the attacker needs to have Contributor access, which is a specific privilege. But in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to have a specific role, that's considered Low (L) because it's not administrative. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but the options are N, L, H. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, but the privileges required are not high, then PR is Low. But I need to check the exact definition. According to CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have a specific role (like Contributor), that's considered Low. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says \"authenticated attackers\", but does the attack require user interaction? The vulnerability is in the functions, so if the attacker can exploit it without needing the user to do anything, then UI is None (N). If the user has to click a link or something, it's Required (R). The description doesn't mention user interaction, so assuming it's None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability is in the plugin, which is part of the WordPress application. If the vulnerability affects the same component (the plugin) that's being attacked, then the scope is Unchanged (U). If it affects a different component, it's Changed (C). Since the plugin is part of the WordPress ecosystem, and the attack is within the same scope, S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A). The vulnerability allows extraction of sensitive data, so Confidentiality is High (H) because the data is sensitive. Integrity and Availability aren't mentioned. The description doesn't say anything about modifying data or disrupting availability, so I and A are None (N). Wait, but the problem says \"extract sensitive private, pending, scheduled, and draft template data.\" So that's a confidentiality impact. Integrity and Availability are not affected. So C is H, I and A are N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low) because the attacker needs Contributor access, which is a specific privilege but not high.\nUI: N (No user interaction required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but wait on PR. The CVSS PR metric: if the attacker needs to have a specific privilege (like Contributor), but not administrative, then PR is Low. However, if the attacker needs to have a certain level of access, but not necessarily high, then it's Low. So yes, PR is Low (L).\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. Wait, but the user interaction is None, so UI:N. Let me check again.\n\nYes, the answer should be:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nSo the vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "score": 2.2, "success": true}

This vulnerability allows an authenticated user to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) in IBM Sterling B2B Integrator. The key points here are that it's an authenticated user vulnerability, allowing them to embed arbitrary JavaScript in the Web UI, leading to potential credential disclosure.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in the Web UI and requires an authenticated user, but the attack is through the web, I think AV is Network (N). Because even though the user is authenticated, the initial attack vector is over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. XSS vulnerabilities typically have low complexity because they often involve injecting malicious scripts, which doesn't require complex steps. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The description says it's an authenticated user. In CVSS, authenticated users are considered to have Low privileges, but wait, the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). Wait, the user needs to be authenticated, which implies they have some level of access. But in CVSS, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered as requiring privileges. However, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required. If the user is already authenticated, maybe the PR is Low? Or is it None? Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a requirement. But in CVSS, if the attacker needs to have a certain level of privileges, like being a user with some access, that's considered Low. But if the attacker doesn't need any privileges, it's None. Wait, the user is authenticated, so they have some privileges. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since the attacker is an authenticated user, they already have the necessary privileges. So maybe PR is None? Wait, no. Wait, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a requirement. But in CVSS, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered as requiring privileges. However, the options are None, Low, High. So if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered as requiring Low privileges? Or is it considered as requiring some level of privilege? Hmm, I think in this case, since the user is authenticated, the attacker needs to have a valid user account, which is a low level of privilege. So PR would be Low (L). Wait, but some sources say that if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered as requiring privileges, but the level depends on the system. For example, if the attacker needs admin rights, that's High. If they just need a regular user account, that's Low. Since the description says \"authenticated user\", which is a regular user, so PR is Low (L). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. According to CVSS guidelines, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's considered as requiring privileges. But the level is determined by the system's access control. If the attacker needs to be a regular user, that's Low. If they need admin, that's High. Since the description doesn't specify, but it's a standard user, I think PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is required. The vulnerability is an XSS that requires the user to interact with the malicious script. For example, the user might need to click on a link or visit a malicious site. So UI is Required (R). Wait, but in some cases, XSS can be triggered without user interaction if the script is injected into a page that the user visits. However, the description says \"allows an authenticated user to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI\". Wait, that might be a bit ambiguous. If the attacker can inject the script into the UI, then when the user visits the page, the script runs automatically. In that case, user interaction might not be required. But the standard for UI in CVSS is whether user interaction is required for the attack to succeed. For example, if the user has to click on a link, that's Required. If the script is executed automatically when the user visits the page, then UI is None. However, in many XSS cases, the user has to be tricked into visiting the malicious page, which might require some interaction. But the CVSS UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be executed without any user interaction, then UI is None. If the user has to perform an action, like clicking a link, then UI is Required. The description here says the user can embed the script, which might imply that the user is the one who is authenticated and can inject the script. Wait, but the vulnerability is that an authenticated user can embed the script. So the attacker is an authenticated user, and they can inject the script into the UI. Then, when another user (or the same user) visits the page, the script runs. So the user interaction might be required if the attacker needs to get the victim to visit the page. But the CVSS UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be executed without any user interaction, then UI is None. However, in this case, the attacker would need to get the user to visit the page with the injected script. So that would require user interaction. Therefore, UI is Required (R). But I'm not entirely sure. Some sources say that for XSS, UI is None if the attack is triggered automatically when the user visits the page. But others might consider that the user has to be tricked into visiting the page, which is user interaction. This is a bit ambiguous. However, the standard for UI in CVSS is whether the attack requires the user to interact with the malicious content. If the user has to click on a link or visit a malicious site, that's Required. If the script is executed automatically when the user visits a legitimate page, then UI is None. In this case, the vulnerability allows the attacker to embed the script in the Web UI. So when the user (victim) visits the UI, the script is executed. Therefore, the user interaction is not required because the script runs automatically when the user is on the page. Wait, but the user has to be on the page. So maybe the user interaction is required. Hmm. This is a tricky part. I think in this case, since the user is authenticated and the script is embedded in the UI, the attack might not require user interaction beyond the initial authentication. But the CVSS UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction to be successful. If the attacker can inject the script into the UI, and then when the user (victim) visits the page, the script runs automatically, then UI is None. However, if the user has to be tricked into visiting the page, that's user interaction. But the description doesn't specify that. It just says the user can embed the script. So maybe the UI is None. Alternatively, if the user is the one who is authenticated and can inject the script, then the attack is on the same user. But that's not clear. I think I need to make a judgment here. Since the vulnerability is in the Web UI, and the attack is through the UI, the user interaction is required. So UI is Required (R). But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check some examples. For example, a typical XSS vulnerability where a user is tricked into visiting a malicious link would have UI:R. If the script is executed automatically when the user visits a legitimate page, then UI:N. But in this case, the attacker is an authenticated user who can inject the script into the UI. So when the user (victim) visits the UI, the script is executed. Therefore, the user interaction is not required beyond the initial authentication. Wait, but the user has to be on the page. So maybe the UI is None. Alternatively, the user has to be authenticated, which is a form of interaction. This is confusing. I think I'll go with UI:R because the attack requires the user to be on the page, which might involve some interaction. But I'm not certain. Maybe I should check the CVSS guidelines again. According to the CVSS v3.1 documentation, User Interaction (UI) is the requirement for a user to interact with the attack. If the attack requires the user to perform an action (like clicking a link), then UI is Required. If the attack can be executed without any user interaction, then UI is None. In this case, the attacker injects the script into the UI, and when the user (victim) visits the page, the script runs. The user doesn't have to perform any action beyond visiting the page. So UI is None. Therefore, UI:N. But I'm still a bit confused. Let me think again. If the user is authenticated and the attacker is the same user, then the script is executed when the user is on the page. But if the attacker is a different user, they need to get the victim to visit the page. In that case, the user interaction is required. However, the description says \"an authenticated user to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI\". So the attacker is an authenticated user, which implies that they can inject the script into the UI. Then, when another user (or the same user) visits the UI, the script runs. Therefore, the user interaction is required if the attacker is a different user. But the CVSS UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be executed without any user interaction, then UI is None.

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the adicionar_tipo_atendido.php endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the tipo parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.16.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored XSS in the adicionar_tipo_atendido.php endpoint of WeGIA. The attacker can inject malicious scripts into the 'tipo' parameter, which are stored on the server and executed when the page is accessed. The fix is in version 3.2.16.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in a web application and the endpoint is accessible over the network, the attack vector is Network (N). That makes sense because the attacker doesn't need physical access or adjacent network access; they can exploit it remotely.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). Stored XSS typically requires the attacker to inject the script into the server, which might involve some steps, but in this case, the parameter is directly used without complex conditions. However, since it's a stored XSS, the attacker just needs to submit the malicious input once, which is relatively low complexity. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). For a stored XSS, the attacker usually doesn't need any special privileges. They just need to submit the malicious input through the web form. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). Stored XSS doesn't require the user to interact with the malicious script. Once the script is stored, any user accessing the page will execute it. Therefore, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component where the attack is initiated. Since the XSS is in the web application itself, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affected a different component, it would be Changed, but here it's within the same application.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). Stored XSS can lead to data theft (confidentiality), data manipulation (integrity), and potentially denial of service if the script is malicious. However, the description mentions that the scripts are stored and executed automatically, which could allow an attacker to steal session cookies (C: High), alter data (I: High), or cause the page to malfunction (A: High). But wait, the CVSS base metrics for confidentiality, integrity, and availability are based on the impact of the vulnerability. Since the XSS can be used to steal data (high confidentiality impact), alter data (high integrity), and maybe disrupt service (high availability). However, in some cases, availability might not be directly impacted unless the script causes the server to crash. But the description says the scripts are stored and executed automatically, which could lead to unauthorized actions, so maybe all three are High. But I need to be careful here. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. For confidentiality, if the attacker can read data they shouldn't, that's High. For integrity, if they can modify data, that's High. Availability might be High if the script causes the service to be unavailable, but the description doesn't mention that. However, the stored XSS could be used to inject scripts that cause the page to not load properly, leading to availability issues. But maybe the primary impact here is confidentiality and integrity. However, the CVSS v3.1 base score calculation for impact uses the formula, and if all three are High, the impact score would be higher. But I need to determine if each of C, I, A is High, Low, or None. Since the vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary scripts, which can lead to data exfiltration (C: H), data modification (I: H), and potentially denial of service (A: H). But the description doesn't explicitly mention availability, so maybe A is Low or None. However, the CVSS guidelines state that if the vulnerability can be used to cause a denial of service, then A is High. But in this case, the stored XSS might not directly cause a DoS unless the script is designed to do so. However, the attacker could inject a script that loops infinitely or consumes resources, leading to a DoS. But without explicit mention, it's safer to assume that the primary impact is on confidentiality and integrity. However, the CVSS impact calculation for availability is considered if the vulnerability can be used to cause a loss of availability. Since the stored XSS could be used to inject a script that makes the page unresponsive, maybe A is Low. But I'm a bit uncertain here. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 impact metrics. The impact score is calculated based on the formula: Impact = 1.0 - [(1 - Confidentiality) * (1 - Integrity) * (1 - Availability)]. If all three are High, the impact is 0.586, but if Availability is Low, then it's 0.586. However, the CVSS guidelines for availability: High if the vulnerability can be used to cause a complete loss of availability, Low if partial, and None otherwise. Since the stored XSS might not directly cause a complete loss of availability, but could be used to disrupt the service, maybe A is Low. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the attacker can inject a script that causes the server to crash, then A is High. But the description doesn't mention that. So perhaps A is None. Wait, the problem says to determine the values for each base metric. The description says the scripts are stored and executed automatically whenever the page is accessed. So the attacker can inject a script that, when executed, could cause the page to not load properly, leading to a denial of service. But that's a bit of a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the availability isn't impacted. So maybe A is None. But I need to make a judgment here. Let me think again. The primary impact of a stored XSS is on confidentiality (stealing data) and integrity (modifying data). Availability might not be a primary concern unless the script is designed to cause a DoS. Since the description doesn't mention availability, I'll go with A: None. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the availability is Low because the script could cause the page to be unresponsive. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 guidelines again. The availability metric is High if the vulnerability can be used to cause a complete loss of availability, Low if partial, and None otherwise. Since the stored XSS could be used to inject a script that makes the page unresponsive, but that's not a guaranteed outcome, maybe it's Low. However, without explicit mention, it's safer to assume that the availability impact is None. So I'll go with C: High, I: High, A: None. Wait, but the CVSS impact calculation for availability is only considered if the vulnerability can be used to cause a loss of availability. If the attacker can inject a script that causes the server to crash, then A is High. But the description doesn't mention that. Therefore, I think A is None. So the metrics would be C: H, I: H, A: N. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the availability is Low. Let me check another angle. The CVSS v3.1 impact metrics for availability: High if the vulnerability can be used to cause a complete loss of availability, Low if partial, and None otherwise. Since the stored XSS could be used to inject a script that causes the page to not load (e.g., an infinite loop), which is a partial loss of availability, then A would be Low. But again, the description doesn't specify that. So perhaps the best approach is to assume that the availability is not impacted, so A: None. However, in practice, stored XSS can be used to cause some disruption, but without explicit mention, it's safer to go with None. So I'll proceed with C: H, I: H, A: N. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but the availability is None. However, in some cases, even if the availability isn't directly mentioned, if the vulnerability can be used to cause a denial of service, then A would be High or Low. But since the description doesn't mention that, I think it's safe to go with None. However, I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject a script that is stored and executed when the page is accessed. If the script is something like a loop that consumes resources, then the availability could be impacted. But without explicit mention, it's hard to say. However, the CVSS guidelines state that if the vulnerability can be used to cause a loss of availability, then A is High or Low. Since the stored XSS could be used to inject a script that causes the page to be unresponsive, which is a partial loss, then A would be Low. But again, this is speculative. Given the ambiguity, I think the most accurate based on the given description is that the availability is not impacted, so A: None.

This issue affects MB-Secure: from V11.04 before V12.53 and MB-Secure PRO from V01.06 before V03.09.Honeywell also recommends updating to the most recent version of this product.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is an OS Command Injection in Honeywell MB-Secure, allowing Privilege Abuse. The affected versions are from V11.04 before V12.53 and MB-Secure PRO from V01.06 before V03.09.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the vulnerability allows Privilege Abuse, but it doesn't specify if it's through a network, adjacent, local, or physical. However, since it's a command injection vulnerability, it's often exploitable remotely over the network. So I think AV is Network (N).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). If the attack requires complex steps, it's High (H), otherwise Low (L). OS command injection typically requires crafting a specific command, which might be considered low complexity if it's straightforward. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability allows Privilege Abuse, which suggests that the attacker might need some level of privilege. But if the vulnerability is in a service that's accessible without authentication, maybe PR is None (N). However, if the attacker needs to have some existing privileges to exploit it, then it might be Low (L). The description says \"Privilege Abuse,\" which might imply that the attacker can escalate privileges, so maybe PR is None because the vulnerability itself allows abuse without needing prior privileges. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again. If the vulnerability is in a component that's accessible without authentication, then PR is None. If it requires the attacker to have some initial access, then PR would be Low or High. The description doesn't mention needing prior authentication, so I'll go with PR: None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). If the attack requires the user to interact, like clicking a link, then UI is Required (R). If it's fully automated, then None (N). Since it's a command injection, it's likely that the attacker can exploit it without user interaction, so UI: None (N).\n\nScope (S). This is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). Since the vulnerability is in MB-Secure itself, the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability allows Privilege Abuse, which could lead to unauthorized access (C: High), modification of data (I: High), or disruption of service (A: High). Since the description mentions \"Privilege Abuse,\" which can lead to unauthorized actions, all three impacts are likely High. So C: H, I: H, A: H.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:H.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Simple Amazon Affiliate plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts via the'msg' parameter. The attack requires tricking a user into clicking a link.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in a parameter that's passed through a link (like a URL parameter), the attack can be initiated over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. Reflected XSS typically doesn't require complex steps. The attacker just needs to craft a malicious link and get the user to click it. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is about what the attacker needs. The description says unauthenticated attackers can exploit this. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is required here. The attack needs the user to click on the malicious link. Without user interaction, the exploit wouldn't work. So UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S) refers to whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. Since the plugin is part of WordPress, and the attack is on the plugin's own component, the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but if the vulnerability is in the plugin, and the attack affects the user's browser, maybe that's a different component. Hmm, but in CVSS, Scope is about whether the vulnerability affects the same component (unchanged) or a different one (changed). Since the plugin is part of the WordPress ecosystem, and the attack is on the plugin's own code, I think S is Unchanged (U). But I'm a bit unsure here. Let me check. If the vulnerability is in the plugin, and the attack is on the plugin's own code, then the scope is unchanged. If the attack affects a different component, like the user's browser, then it's changed. But in this case, the XSS is in the plugin's response, so the scope is the same component. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. For XSS, the main impact is on integrity and confidentiality. The attacker can inject scripts that steal session cookies (confidentiality), modify the page (integrity), but not directly affect availability. However, the description says \"arbitrary web scripts\" which could be used to steal data (C:H) or manipulate the page (I:H). Availability might not be affected here. So C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nWait, but the UI is Required (R) because the user has to click the link. So that's correct. Let me double-check each metric again.\n\nYes, AV is Network because it's via a URL parameter. AC is Low because no complex steps. PR is None because no authentication needed. UI is Required. Scope is Unchanged. Impact: High for confidentiality and integrity, none for availability.

An attacker could send a specially crafted URL request containing \"dot dot\" sequences (/../) to view arbitrary files on the system.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in IBM InfoSphere Information Server 11.7, allowing a remote attacker to traverse directories by sending a specially crafted URL with \"dot dot\" sequences. The main issue here is directory traversal, which can lead to unauthorized access to files.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions a remote attacker, so the attack can be initiated over a network. That points to AV:N (Network).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The attacker needs to craft a URL with specific sequences, but it's not overly complex. Since it's a straightforward exploit without needing complex steps, AC is likely Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) – the attacker doesn't need any prior authentication. They can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing any special privileges. So PR:N (None).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) – the attack doesn't require any interaction from the user. The attacker can send the request directly, so UI:N (None).\n\nScope (S) – the vulnerability affects the same component that's being attacked. Since the server is the target and the attack is on the server's file system, the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C) – the attacker can access arbitrary files, which means they can read sensitive data. So C:H (High).\n\nIntegrity (I) – the vulnerability allows reading files, but not modifying them. Unless the attacker can overwrite files, which isn't mentioned here, I would be N (None). Wait, but the description says \"view arbitrary files,\" which is about confidentiality, not integrity. So I:N.\n\nAvailability (A) – the vulnerability doesn't mention affecting the availability of the system. It's about reading files, not causing a denial of service. So A:N.\n\nWait, but I need to check again. The problem is directory traversal leading to reading files. So confidentiality is high, integrity and availability are none. That makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N. Then the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.

Availability might not be directly impacted unless the attack causes a denial of service. Since the description doesn't mention availability, maybe it's None (N). Wait, but the problem says to determine based on the description. The vulnerability allows path traversal, which can lead to reading or writing files, so confidentiality and integrity are high. Availability isn't mentioned, so maybe N. But I need to check if the exploit could affect availability. If the attack is just reading files, then availability isn't affected. So C and I are H, A is N. Wait, but the original question says to determine each metric. Let me recheck.\n\nThe CVE description says the vulnerability is a path traversal. Path traversal vulnerabilities typically allow access to files outside the intended directory, which can lead to reading sensitive files (confidentiality) or overwriting files (integrity). Availability might not be directly impacted unless the attack causes the system to crash, which isn't mentioned here. So C and I are H, A is N. But I need to be careful. If the attack can overwrite critical system files, that could cause availability issues, but the description doesn't specify that. So maybe A is N.

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is an XSS in langgenius/dify versions before 1.1.3, affecting Firefox browsers. The attacker can get the admin's token by sending a payload in a published chat. When the admin views the conversation via the monitoring/log function in Firefox, the XSS is triggered, exposing the token.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the attacker sends a payload in the published chat. Since the chat is likely accessible over the network (like a web application), the attack vector is probably Network (N). Unless it's a local exploit, but the mention of Firefox and viewing through a monitoring function suggests it's through the web, so AV=N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): XSS vulnerabilities often require low complexity. The attacker just needs to inject the payload, which is straightforward. So AC=L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any special privileges. The XSS is triggered when the admin views the content, so the attacker doesn't need to have admin rights. So PR=N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered when the admin views the conversation. That means the admin has to interact by viewing the content. So UI=R (Required). Wait, but the attack requires the user (admin) to interact. So UI=R.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the web application) that the admin is using. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If it affected a different component, it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same application.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can obtain the admin's token, which is a high impact on confidentiality. So C=H.\n\nIntegrity (I): The XSS could allow the attacker to modify data, but the description specifically mentions obtaining the token, not modifying data. However, XSS can sometimes be used for other attacks. But the main impact here is confidentiality. But the CVSS might consider integrity as H if the attacker can inject malicious scripts. Wait, the vulnerability allows the attacker to obtain the token, which is a confidentiality issue. However, XSS can also affect integrity if the attacker can inject scripts that alter data. But the description doesn't mention integrity impact. Hmm. The problem is that the attacker gets the token, which is a confidentiality issue. So maybe I=N? But I'm not sure. Wait, the CVSS metrics for I are based on whether the vulnerability allows the attacker to alter data. Since the XSS is used to steal the token, which is a confidentiality issue, but the integrity might not be affected. So I=N? Or maybe H if the XSS can be used to inject malicious code that alters data. But the description doesn't mention that. The main impact is confidentiality. So I might be N. But I need to check. Alternatively, maybe the attacker can inject scripts that modify data, but the description doesn't specify that. So perhaps I=N. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The vulnerability is an XSS that allows the attacker to get the token. So the primary impact is confidentiality. Integrity might not be directly affected unless the XSS is used to modify data. Since the description doesn't mention that, I would say I=N. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the attacker can inject scripts that alter the page, which could affect integrity. But the problem is that the description doesn't mention that. So maybe I=N. But I need to make a decision here.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't mention affecting availability. The attacker can't cause a denial of service. So A=N.\n\nWait, but the CVSS base score calculation for I and A depends on the impact. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts, which could potentially alter data (integrity) or cause the system to crash (availability), but the description doesn't mention those. So I think I=N and A=N.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but the UI is Required because the admin has to view the conversation. So UI=R. That's correct.\n\nBut let me check the CVSS v3.1 metrics again. The User Interaction metric is whether the attack requires user interaction. In this case, the admin has to view the conversation, so the attack requires user interaction. So UI=R.\n\nNow, for the Scope (S), since the vulnerability is in the same component (the web application) that the admin is using, the scope is unchanged. So S=U.\n\nConfidentiality is High because the attacker can obtain the admin's token. Integrity and Availability are None because the description doesn't mention those impacts.\n\nSo the vector string would be:\n\nAV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n\nWait, but I thought I might have considered I as N. But maybe I should check again. If the XSS allows the attacker to inject scripts, which could potentially alter data, but the description doesn't mention that. The main impact is confidentiality. So I=N. Availability is N. So the final vector is as above.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. For Integrity, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to alter data, then I=H. If it's possible but not certain, maybe L. But in this case, the attacker is stealing the token, not altering data.

This can cause a deadlock in the scenario reported by syz-bot below: CPU0 CPU1 CPU2 ---- ---- ---- lock(console_owner); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(console_owner); As commit dbdda842fe96 (\"printk: Add console owner and waiter logic to load balance console writes\") said, such deadlock can be prevented by using printk_deferred() in kmalloc() (which is invoked in the section guarded by the port->lock). But there are too many printk() on the kmalloc() path, and kmalloc() can be called from anywhere, so changing printk() to printk_deferred() is too complicated and inelegant. Therefore, this patch chooses to specify __GFP_NOWARN to kmalloc(), so that printk() will not be called, and this deadlock problem can be avoided.

First, I need to understand the vulnerability described in the CVE. The issue is a deadlock in the Linux kernel caused by a specific sequence of lock acquisitions. The problem arises when printk() is called under tty_port->lock, leading to a deadlock scenario. The fix was to use __GFP_NOWARN in kmalloc() to prevent the printk() call.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel-level issue, it can be exploited remotely if an attacker can trigger the specific conditions. However, the description doesn't mention network access, but since it's a kernel vulnerability, it might be exploitable via local access. Wait, but the deadlock is due to internal kernel operations. However, if an attacker can execute code that leads to this deadlock, maybe through a local exploit. But the original problem is a deadlock that could be triggered by certain operations. However, the CVSS AV metric for kernel vulnerabilities is usually Network (N) if it can be exploited remotely, but if it's a local privilege escalation, then it's Local (L). But in this case, the vulnerability is a deadlock that might not directly allow an attacker to gain privileges but could cause a denial of service. However, the CVSS AV for kernel issues that require local access is usually Local (L). Wait, but the problem here is that the deadlock is a result of internal operations. However, the exploit would require the attacker to have some way to trigger the specific code path that leads to the deadlock. Since the kernel is running on the system, an attacker would need local access to exploit this. Therefore, AV is Local (L). But I need to be careful here. If the vulnerability can be triggered by a local user, then AV is Local. If it's a remote exploit, then Network. But the description doesn't mention remote exploitation. So I think AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a deadlock that occurs under specific conditions. The attacker would need to trigger the exact sequence of lock acquisitions that leads to the deadlock. This might require some level of complexity, but since it's a specific scenario, maybe the AC is Low (L) because it's not very complex to exploit once the conditions are met. However, if the attacker needs to have precise control over the execution flow, maybe High (H). But in this case, the deadlock is a result of the code's internal logic, so if an attacker can cause the code to be executed in that specific way, it's possible. Since the problem is a deadlock that could be triggered by certain operations, maybe the AC is Low. I think AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so an attacker would need to have some level of privileges to trigger the code path. However, the deadlock itself might not require elevated privileges. Wait, but the code that's causing the deadlock is part of the kernel's normal operations. If the attacker is a local user, they might have the necessary privileges to perform the actions that trigger the deadlock. However, if the vulnerability can be exploited without any privileges, then PR is None (N). But in this case, the deadlock is a result of the kernel's internal operations. If the attacker is a local user, they can trigger the code that leads to the deadlock. However, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have root or administrative privileges, then PR is High (H). If they can do it with low privileges, then Low (L). If no privileges are needed, then None (N). Since the kernel is running with high privileges, but the attacker would need to have the ability to execute code that leads to the deadlock. If the attacker is a local user, they might have the necessary privileges. However, the PR metric for kernel vulnerabilities is often High (H) because you need to have access to the system. Wait, but if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that can be accessed by a local user without elevated privileges, then PR could be Low or None. However, in this case, the deadlock is a result of the kernel's internal operations. If the attacker is a local user, they can trigger the code that leads to the deadlock. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without any additional privileges beyond what a normal user has, then PR is None (N). But if they need to have root access, then High (H). However, the problem here is that the deadlock is a result of the kernel's own operations. If the attacker is a local user, they can trigger the code that leads to the deadlock. Therefore, PR is None (N) because no additional privileges are needed beyond what a local user already has. Wait, but the kernel is running with high privileges, but the attacker is a local user. So maybe PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to have elevated privileges to trigger the code. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. I think PR is None (N) because the attacker can exploit it without needing any additional privileges beyond being a local user.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a deadlock that occurs due to the code's internal logic. The attacker doesn't need to interact with the user for the exploit to work. Therefore, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel) that is being attacked. Since the exploit is within the same scope, S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability is a deadlock, which might not directly impact confidentiality. However, if the deadlock leads to a system crash or denial of service, it might not affect confidentiality. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the deadlock doesn't directly affect the integrity of the data. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The deadlock can cause the system to hang or crash, leading to a denial of service. Therefore, A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.7000000000000002, "success": true}

Affected by this vulnerability is the function operationDailyOut of the file /safeEvent/download. The manipulation of the argument filename leads to path traversal. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to go through the CVE description and figure out each metric based on the given options.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attack can be launched remotely. That usually means Network (N), since it's not local or physical. So AV is N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The vulnerability is a path traversal via a filename argument. If it's a simple parameter manipulation without needing complex steps, that's Low (L). So AC is L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) – the attack is remote and doesn't mention needing any user privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) – the exploit doesn't require user interaction, as it's a remote attack. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) – the vulnerability affects the same component, so the scope is Unchanged (U). If it was a different component, it would be Changed (C), but here it's the same function, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) – the vulnerability allows path traversal, which can lead to unauthorized access to files (confidentiality), modifying files (integrity), and possibly causing denial of service (availability). Since the exploit can be used to access or modify files, all three are High (H). But wait, the description says \"path traversal\" which typically affects confidentiality (reading files) and integrity (writing files). Availability might not be directly impacted unless the traversal leads to resource exhaustion. But the description doesn't mention availability issues, so maybe A is N. Hmm, need to check. The original description says the manipulation of the filename leads to path traversal. That's more about accessing files, so confidentiality and integrity. Availability isn't mentioned, so A is N. Wait, but the problem says \"the exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.\" But that doesn't directly imply availability. So maybe C and I are H, and A is N. But I need to be careful here. Let me think again. Path traversal vulnerabilities typically allow reading or writing files, which affects confidentiality (if reading) and integrity (if writing). So C and I would be H. Availability (A) is not mentioned, so it's N. But sometimes, if the attack can cause the system to crash, but the description doesn't say that. So I'll go with C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nWait, but the original CVE description says \"the manipulation of the argument filename leads to path traversal.\" So the attacker can access files they shouldn't, which is confidentiality (C:H). If they can write files, that's integrity (I:H). But the description doesn't specify if it's read-only or if they can write. However, path traversal is often about reading, but sometimes can be used for writing. Since the description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is classified as problematic, maybe both C and I are H. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the impact is only on confidentiality. But the problem says to choose based on the given description. The description doesn't mention integrity or availability, but the vulnerability is a path traversal, which is typically a confidentiality issue. However, in some cases, it can also affect integrity. But without explicit mention, maybe I should only set C:H and I:N, A:N. Wait, but the CVSS guidelines might have default values. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 guidelines. For example, if the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to data, then C is H. If it allows unauthorized modification, then I is H. If it allows denial of service, then A is H. Since the description says \"path traversal,\" which is about accessing files, so C is H. If the attack can also modify files, then I is H. But the description doesn't specify that. So maybe I should only set C:H and I:N, A:N. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the default is to assume that if the vulnerability allows access to data, then both confidentiality and integrity are affected. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the example in the problem. The example vector has C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. The actual answer depends on the description. Since the problem states that the vulnerability is a path traversal, which is typically a confidentiality issue. So I'll go with C:H, I:N, A:N. Wait, but maybe the integrity is also affected if the attacker can write to files. But the description doesn't mention that. So maybe I should only set C:H and leave I and A as N. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the default is to set all three to H if the vulnerability is considered high impact. But the problem says to base it on the description. The description doesn't mention integrity or availability, so maybe they are N. But I need to be precise. Let me think again. The vulnerability allows path traversal, which is a way to access files outside the intended directory. This would allow reading files (confidentiality) but not necessarily modifying them (integrity) unless the attack can write. Since the description doesn't mention writing, maybe I is N. Availability is not mentioned, so A is N. So the metrics would be C:H, I:N, A:N. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the integrity is also H because the attacker could potentially overwrite files. But without explicit mention, it's safer to assume only confidentiality is affected. So I'll go with C:H, I:N, A:N. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 guidelines again. The impact metrics are based on the potential impact of the vulnerability. If the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to data, then confidentiality is H. If it allows unauthorized modification, integrity is H. If it allows denial of service, availability is H. Since the description only mentions path traversal (access), I think C is H, and I and A are N. So the final metrics would be:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but the example in the problem's final line has C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. The actual answer depends on the CVE description. So in this case, the answer would be:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the integrity. Maybe the problem expects I:H because path traversal can be used to overwrite files. But the description doesn't specify that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the default is to set all three to H if the vulnerability is considered high impact. But the problem says to base it on the description. Since the description doesn't mention integrity or availability, I think they should be N. So the final vector would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n\nBut I'm not 100% confident about the I and A. Let me check again. The vulnerability is a path traversal, which is typically a confidentiality issue. So C:H. Integrity and availability are not mentioned, so N. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

Fix the issue by using guard(raw_spinlock). [ tglx: Massaged change log ]\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the irqchip/gic-v3-its module. The issue is that interrupts are being enabled in a nested interrupt disabled section, which was introduced by a specific commit. The fix involved changing the spinlock mechanism.\n\nNow, to determine the CVSS metrics, I need to analyze the vulnerability's characteristics. Let's go through each metric one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel-level issue, it's likely exploitable remotely if an attacker can trigger the vulnerability through a system call or some other means. However, the description doesn't mention network access. But kernel vulnerabilities are often exploitable via local access, like through a user-space application. However, if the vulnerability can be triggered by a local user without needing elevated privileges, maybe AV is Local (L). Wait, but sometimes kernel bugs can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger them over the network. But the description here doesn't specify that. The fix is about a race condition in interrupt handling, which might be exploitable by a local user. So maybe AV is Local (L). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the vulnerability can be triggered by a local user without needing any special access, AV is Local. If it's a kernel bug that can be exploited via a local exploit, then AV is Local. But if it's a remote exploit, then Network (N). The description doesn't mention remote exploitation, so I think AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to a specific code change that introduces a race condition. Exploiting this might require precise conditions, like timing or specific system states. So the attack complexity is likely High (H). But if it's a simple mistake that can be exploited with minimal effort, maybe Low (L). However, kernel vulnerabilities often require specific conditions, so High (H) seems more accurate.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so an attacker would need to have some level of access. If the vulnerability can be exploited by a local user without needing elevated privileges, then PR is None (N). But if it requires root or some other high privilege, then PR is High (H). However, the description mentions that the issue is in the kernel's interrupt handling, which is part of the core OS. Exploiting this might require local access but not necessarily root. Wait, but if the vulnerability allows a local user to escalate privileges, then PR would be Low (L) or High (H). However, the description doesn't mention privilege escalation. It's a race condition in interrupt handling. So maybe the attacker needs to have local access to trigger the vulnerability, but not necessarily elevated privileges. So PR is None (N) if the attacker can exploit it without any privileges. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the vulnerability is in the kernel, maybe it's only exploitable by a local user with some privileges. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let me think again. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, but the code path is triggered by a user-space application, then the attacker would need to have the ability to run code that triggers the vulnerability. That would require some level of access, but not necessarily root. So maybe PR is Low (L) or None (N). But I think in CVSS, if the attacker needs to have some level of access (like a local user), then PR is None (N) if no privileges are required. Wait, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, then PR is None. If they need to have low or high privileges, then accordingly. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, but the exploit would be triggered by a local user, perhaps the attacker needs to have local access, which is considered as requiring no privileges (since the user is already on the system). So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a race condition in the kernel. Exploiting it might not require user interaction. If the attacker can trigger it through a system call or some other automated means, then UI is None (N). If the exploit requires the user to perform an action, like clicking a link, then UI is Required (R). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the exploit is likely through a system call or similar, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel) that is being attacked. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allows affecting a different component, then Changed (C). But here, it's within the kernel, so S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability is a race condition in interrupt handling. If exploited, what impact would it have? If the race condition leads to a denial of service (like a crash or lockup), then Availability (A) is High (H). If it allows data leakage, then Confidentiality (C) is High. If it allows data modification, then Integrity (I) is High. However, the description doesn't specify the impact. The fix is about enabling interrupts in a nested disabled section, which could lead to a system crash or instability. So the primary impact is on Availability. Therefore, A is High (H). C and I might be None (N) unless the vulnerability allows data exposure or modification. Since the description doesn't mention that, I'll assume C and I are None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) – because the vulnerability is in the kernel and requires local access.\nAC: High (H) – due to the specific conditions needed to exploit the race condition.\nPR: None (N) – if the attacker can exploit it without needing elevated privileges.\nUI: None (N) – no user interaction required.\nS: Unchanged (U) – same component affected.\nC: None (N) – no confidentiality impact.\nI: None (N) – no integrity impact.\nA: High (H) – availability impact due to potential system crash.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about AV. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, but the exploit can be done via a local user, then AV is Local. However, sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger them over the network. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think AV is Local (L) is correct.\n\nAnother point: the PR metric. If the attacker needs to have local access, but that's considered as requiring no privileges (since the user is already on the system), then PR is None (N). But if the user needs to have some privileges to run the code that triggers the vulnerability, then PR would be Low (L). However, in the context of CVSS, if the attacker is a local user, PR is considered as None (N) because the user is already on the system and doesn't need to escalate privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nSo the final metrics would be:\n\nAV: L\nAC: H\nPR: N\nUI: N\nS: U\nC: N\nI: N\nA: H\n\nVector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.40000000000000036, "success": true}

An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-26284.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Sony XAV-AX8500's Bluetooth implementation, specifically an authentication bypass due to improper isolation in ACL-U links. The attacker can bypass authentication without needing to be authenticated themselves. The attack is network-adjacent, meaning it's not over the internet but requires being near the device, like on the same network or physically close.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description says \"network-adjacent attackers,\" which I think maps to Adjacent (A) since it's not over the network (which would be N) but requires proximity. So AV is A.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The vulnerability allows bypassing authentication without needing any specific steps, so it's likely Low (L). If it required complex steps, it would be High, but here it's straightforward.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is None (N) because the description states that authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker doesn't need any prior access or privileges.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is None (N) since the attack doesn't require any user interaction. The attacker can exploit it without the user doing anything, like clicking a link or opening a file.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability exists in the same component that's being attacked. There's no indication that the attack affects a different component or scope beyond the original system.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are all High (H) because the authentication bypass allows an attacker to access the system without authorization, which could lead to full access (confidentiality), modify data (integrity), and potentially disrupt services (availability). Since the vulnerability allows bypassing authentication, all three impacts are high.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:A, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:H.

This issue is fixed in macOS Ventura 13.7.3, macOS Sequoia 15.3, macOS Sonoma 14.7.3. A malicious application may be able to leak sensitive user information.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The issue is about a malicious application potentially leaking sensitive user information. The fix is in various macOS versions, so it's a vulnerability that's been patched.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description says a malicious application could do this. Since it's an application, that implies it's running on the same system, so maybe Local (L)? But wait, if the application is malicious, maybe it's exploiting a vulnerability that's accessible over the network? Hmm, the description doesn't mention network access. It just says a malicious application. So I think AV is Local (L) because the attacker needs to have an application running on the system. But wait, sometimes applications can be installed via network, but the attack vector here is the method by which the attacker can exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is in a service that's accessible over the network, then AV would be Network (N). But the description doesn't specify that. It just says a malicious application. So maybe it's a local exploit, so AV is Local (L). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. If the application is already installed on the system, then the attack vector is local. If the attacker can run the application remotely, maybe through a network, but the description doesn't mention that. So I'll go with AV: Local (L).\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says \"may be able to leak,\" which suggests that it's not very complex. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The malicious application would need to be running on the system. If the application is already installed, maybe the attacker doesn't need any privileges. But if the application requires some level of access, maybe Low (L) or None (N). Wait, if the attacker can run the application without any special privileges, then PR is None (N). But if the application requires some user interaction or privileges, maybe Low. The description says \"malicious application may be able to leak,\" which might imply that the application is already running with some privileges. But I'm not sure. Since it's a local application, maybe the attacker needs to have the application installed, which might require some privileges. But the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is in a service that's accessible without user privileges, then PR is None. But if the attacker needs to have some level of access, like user-level privileges, then PR is Low. Since the description doesn't specify, but it's a local application, I think PR is None (N) because the attacker can exploit it without needing elevated privileges. Wait, but if the application is malicious, maybe it's already running with user privileges. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have the application installed, which might require some level of access. But I'm not certain. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, it's None. If they need to have some level of access, like user-level, then Low. If they need admin, then High. Since the application is malicious, maybe the attacker needs to have the application installed, which might require user privileges. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability, not to install the application. So if the vulnerability is in a service that's accessible without any privileges, then PR is None. But if the attacker needs to have some access to the system, like user-level, then PR is Low. I think in this case, since it's a local application, the attacker might need to have the application installed, which could be done with user privileges. So PR is Low (L). But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should go with PR: Low (L) here.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says \"may be able to leak,\" but doesn't mention if user interaction is required. If the application is running and the exploit is automatic, then UI is None (N). If the user has to click on something, then Required (R). Since the description doesn't mention user interaction, I'll assume UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability is in the system, and the exploit is within the same system. So the scope is Unchanged (U), because the vulnerability is in the same component. If the exploit affects a different component, then Changed (C). But here, it's about leaking user information, which is part of the same system, so S: Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A). The vulnerability allows leaking sensitive user information, which directly impacts confidentiality. So C is High (H). Integrity and Availability aren't mentioned, so they are None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: Low (L)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: High (H)\nI: None (N)\nA: None (N)\n\nWait, but earlier I was confused about AV. Let me recheck. If the attack vector is through a local application, then AV is Local (L). But if the application is installed via a network, but the exploit is local, then AV is still Local. So AV: L.\n\nBut some sources might consider that if the application is installed via network, but the exploit is local, AV is still Local. So I think AV is L.\n\nSo the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n\nWait, but the user interaction was UI: None (N), which is correct. But I'm not sure about PR. If the attacker needs to have the application installed, which might require some privileges, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the application is already installed, then the attacker might not need any privileges. But if the application is installed by the user, then maybe the attacker needs to have user privileges. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability, not to install the application. So if the vulnerability is in a service that's accessible without any privileges, then PR is None. But if the attacker needs to have some access to the system to run the application, then PR is Low. Since the description says \"malicious application may be able to leak,\" it's possible that the application is already running with user privileges, so the attacker doesn't need to have elevated privileges. Therefore, PR could be None (N). Wait, but if the application is malicious, maybe it's a third-party app that the user installed, which would require user privileges. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is in the application itself, then the attacker would need to have the application installed, which might require user privileges. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability, not to install the application. So if the application is already installed, then the attacker can exploit it without needing additional privileges. Therefore, PR is None (N). Hmm, this is conflicting. Let me check the CVSS 3.1 guidelines again.\n\nAccording to CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to have the same privileges as the user who is running the application, then PR is Low. If the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, then PR is None. If the attacker needs admin privileges, then High. In this case, the malicious application is already running on the system, so the attacker might need to have the application installed, which would require user privileges. But once the application is installed, the attacker can exploit it without needing additional privileges. Therefore, PR is None (N). Wait, but the application itself might be running with user privileges. So the attacker doesn't need to have any additional privileges beyond what the application already has. Therefore, PR is None (N). So maybe I was wrong earlier and PR is None (N). That would change the calculation.\n\nSo revising:\n\nPR: None (N)\n\nThen the vector would be:\n\nAV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n\nBut I need to be sure. Let me think again. If the vulnerability is in a local application, and the attacker can exploit it by running the application, then the attacker doesn't need any additional privileges beyond what the application already has. So the PR is None (N). Because the attacker doesn't need to elevate privileges to exploit it. The application is already running with the necessary privileges. Therefore, PR is None (N).\n\nSo the correct metrics would be:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: High (H)\nI: None (N)\nA: None (N)\n\nSo the vector string is:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n\nBut wait, the original description says \"malicious application may be able to leak sensitive user information.\" If the application is malicious, perhaps it's a third-party app that the user installed, which would require user privileges. But the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is in the application, then the attacker doesn't need to have any additional privileges beyond what the application already has. So PR is None (N). Therefore, the correct PR is None (N).\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

As a result, ieee80211_beacons_stop() will block forever. This patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of spin_lock_irqsave(), which could let timer handler to obtain the needed lock.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is a deadlock in the Linux kernel's ieee80211_beacons_stop() function. The issue arises when two threads are trying to acquire the same lock in a way that causes them to block each other indefinitely. The fix involves moving del_timer_sync() out of the spin_lock_irqsave() to prevent this deadlock.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel-level issue, it's likely exploitable remotely if an attacker can trigger the deadlock through network operations. However, the description doesn't mention network access specifically. But considering that the ieee80211 is related to wireless networking, maybe the attack vector is Network (N). But wait, the deadlock is a concurrency issue that might not require network access. However, if the system is running a service that uses the wireless driver, an attacker might exploit it over the network. Alternatively, if it's a local exploit, maybe AV is Local (L). Hmm, this is tricky. The kernel is part of the system, so if an attacker has local access, they could exploit it. But if the deadlock can be triggered by a remote user via network traffic, then AV would be Network. The description doesn't specify, but since it's a kernel-level deadlock, it's possible that an attacker with local privileges could exploit it. But I'm not sure. Maybe AV is Local (L) because it's a kernel issue that requires local access to trigger. Wait, but sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely. However, without more info, I might default to Local (L) unless there's a clear network component. The ieee80211 is for wireless, so maybe the attack vector is Network. But the deadlock is a concurrency issue, not a buffer overflow or something that can be triggered remotely. I think AV is Local (L) here because it's a local kernel issue that requires local access to exploit.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Deadlock issues usually require specific conditions to be met. The attacker would need to create a scenario where two threads are in a state that causes the deadlock. This might be complex, so AC is High (H). But if the deadlock can be triggered easily with certain operations, maybe Low (L). However, deadlocks are often complex to trigger, so I'll go with High (H).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Since it's a kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need high privileges to exploit it. But wait, if the deadlock is in a part of the kernel that's accessible to user-space applications, maybe the attacker needs low or no privileges. However, kernel-level issues typically require root or high privileges. But the description doesn't mention privilege escalation. The deadlock is a concurrency issue that might be triggered by a local user with some access. However, if the code is part of a driver that's used by user-space applications, maybe the attacker needs low privileges. But I'm not sure. The PR could be High (H) if the attacker needs root access. Alternatively, if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that's accessible without elevated privileges, maybe PR is Low (L). But I think for kernel issues, PR is usually High (H) unless it's a user-space vulnerability. So I'll go with High (H).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Deadlock issues typically don't require user interaction. The attacker can exploit it without any user action. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel), so the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability could affect other components or escalate privileges, it might be Changed (C), but here it's a local issue in the kernel, so S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The deadlock doesn't directly leak data, but if the system becomes unresponsive, it might affect confidentiality if the system can't be accessed. However, the primary impact is on availability. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the deadlock doesn't corrupt data, so I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The deadlock causes the system to hang or become unresponsive, which directly impacts availability. So A is High (H).\n\nWait, but the CVSS base metrics for availability: if the vulnerability leads to a denial of service, then A is High. Since the deadlock would cause the system to stop responding, that's a high impact on availability.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) or Network (N)? Hmm, I'm still a bit confused. The ieee80211 is related to wireless, so maybe the attack vector is Network. But the deadlock is a concurrency issue that might not require network access. However, if the system is using the wireless driver, an attacker could send packets that trigger the deadlock. But without explicit mention, it's safer to assume Local (L) unless there's a clear network component. Alternatively, maybe the attack vector is Adjacent (A) if it's a local network. But the options are N, A, L, P. Since the kernel is part of the system, and the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attack vector is likely Local (L). So AV: L.\n\nAC: High (H) as discussed.\n\nPR: High (H) because kernel-level access requires high privileges.\n\nUI: None (N).\n\nS: Unchanged (U).\n\nC: None (N).\n\nI: None (N).\n\nA: High (H).\n\nSo the vector would be AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the CVSS v3.1 base score calculation might have different values. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem is that the vulnerability is a deadlock in the kernel. If an attacker can trigger this deadlock, the system would crash or hang, which is a DoS. But to trigger this, the attacker would need to have some way to cause the two threads to be in that state. If the attacker is a local user, then AV is Local. If the attacker can exploit this remotely, then AV is Network. The description doesn't specify, but since it's a kernel issue, it's possible that it's a local vulnerability. However, sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely. But without more info, I think AV is Local (L).\n\nBut maybe the attack vector is Network because the ieee80211 is for wireless. If the attacker sends specific packets that trigger the deadlock, then AV is Network. But the deadlock is a concurrency issue that requires two threads to be in a certain state. It's possible that this could be triggered by a remote user sending packets that cause the driver to enter that state. However, without explicit mention, it's safer to assume Local (L) unless the vulnerability is clearly exploitable over the network.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the attack vector is Adjacent (A) if it's a local network. But the options are N, A, L, P. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the system, and the attack requires local access to the system, AV is Local (L).\n\nSo, final metrics:\n\nAV: L\n\nAC: H\n\nPR: H\n\nUI: N\n\nS: U\n\nC: N\n\nI: N\n\nA: H\n\nVector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.4000000000000004, "success": true}

The description mentions that attackers can access the data via the 'uploads' directory, which is typically accessible over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next.

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Tainacan plugin for WordPress, allowing SQL injection through the 'collection_id' parameter. The issue is due to insufficient escaping and lack of proper SQL query preparation. The attacker needs to be authenticated with Subscriber-level access or higher.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in a parameter that's passed through a web request (like a form or URL parameter), the attack can be done over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. SQL injection typically requires crafting a specific payload, but if the input isn't properly sanitized, it might be easier. However, the description mentions \"insufficient escaping\" and \"lack of sufficient preparation,\" which might mean that the attacker can inject SQL without needing complex conditions. But I think AC is Low (L) here because the attacker can exploit it with a simple injection, not requiring high complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to be authenticated as a Subscriber or higher. In WordPress, Subscriber is a low-level role, but they still have some access. However, the vulnerability allows authenticated users to exploit it. Since the attacker needs to be authenticated, but the required privileges are low (Subscriber is a low-level role), PR is Low (L). Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. But in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges needed. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. However, if the authentication is considered as a low-level privilege, then PR is Low. But if the system doesn't require any authentication, it's None. Here, the attacker must be authenticated, so PR is Low (L) because Subscriber is a low-level role. Wait, but maybe the system requires authentication, so the attacker needs to have some privileges. But in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. However, the options are None, Low, High. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, but the required privileges are low (like Subscriber), then PR is Low. Alternatively, if the attacker doesn't need any privileges, it's None. But in this case, the attacker must be authenticated, so PR is Low (L). Hmm, I think that's correct.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description says the attacker can exploit it without needing user interaction. Since the attack is done via a parameter in a request, the user doesn't need to interact. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component (the plugin) that's being attacked. Since the attack is within the same security boundary (the WordPress site), the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same system.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability allows extracting sensitive information, so Confidentiality is High (H). Integrity and Availability aren't mentioned, but since SQL injection can modify data or cause denial of service, but the description only mentions extracting data. However, the CVSS metrics for I and A are based on the impact. If the vulnerability allows data extraction, that's a confidentiality impact. If the attacker can modify data, that's integrity. But the description doesn't mention modifying data or affecting availability. So I and A would be None (N). Wait, but the CVSS v3.1 impact metrics are based on the potential impact. If the vulnerability allows reading data, that's High for C. If it can modify data, that's High for I. If it can cause denial of service, that's High for A. Since the description only mentions extracting sensitive information, C is High. I and A are not mentioned, so they are None. But wait, sometimes even if the description doesn't mention it, the CVSS might assume that the vulnerability could have other impacts. However, the standard is to base it on the description. Since the description only mentions confidentiality, I and A are None. But I need to check if the SQL injection could also affect integrity or availability. For example, if the attacker can inject a query to delete data, that would affect integrity. But the description says \"extract sensitive information,\" so maybe only confidentiality is affected. Therefore, C is H, I and A are N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but the attacker needs to be authenticated. So PR is Low (L) because they need to have Subscriber access, which is a low-level privilege. If the attacker didn't need any authentication, PR would be None. But since they do need to be authenticated, PR is Low. So that's correct.\n\nSo the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n\nWait, but I thought I and A were N. Let me check again. The description says the attacker can extract sensitive information, so confidentiality is High. The other two (integrity and availability) are not mentioned, so they are None. So yes, I and A are N. Therefore, the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

Fix the validation avoiding the addition.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the arm_scmi firmware. The issue is about improper validation of the number of returned protocols when using BASE_DISCOVER_LIST_PROTOCOLS. The problem arises from an unsigned integer overflow that could allow a large 'loop_num_ret' value to bypass the check silently.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel-level issue, it's likely that an attacker could exploit it remotely. However, the description doesn't mention network access. But considering that the SCMI (System Control and Management Interface) is used in ARM-based systems, which might be part of a device's firmware. However, without specific mention of network access, maybe it's a local issue. Wait, but the vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the system. If an attacker can exploit this, they might need local access to the system. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the firmware is accessible over a network, maybe AV is Network. But the description doesn't specify. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the kernel's handling of firmware, which is part of the system's internal operations. So, an attacker would need to have some way to trigger this, which might require local access. So maybe AV is Local (L). But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, if the firmware is part of a device that's connected to a network, maybe it's adjacent (A) or network (N). But the description doesn't mention that. I think the safest assumption here is that it's a local vulnerability because it's in the kernel and requires access to the system. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow in the validation. Exploiting this would require the attacker to provide a large value for 'loop_num_ret' that causes the overflow. This might be considered low complexity because the attacker just needs to send a specific input that triggers the overflow. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, an attacker would need to have some level of access to the system. If the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that's accessible to user-space applications, maybe the attacker needs low privileges. However, kernel vulnerabilities often require root or high privileges. But the description doesn't specify. Wait, the vulnerability is in the firmware handling. If the firmware is part of the system's management, maybe it's accessible with low privileges. Alternatively, if it's a kernel module, maybe the attacker needs to have some way to trigger the code, which might require local access. But the PR metric is about the level of privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit this without needing elevated privileges, then PR is None (N). But if they need to have some user-level access, then PR is Low (L). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, but the exploit might be triggered through a user-space application, maybe PR is Low. However, I'm not sure. Another angle: if the vulnerability is in the kernel, but the exploit requires the attacker to have local access (like a user on the system), then PR would be Low. If the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, that's PR None. But I think in this case, since it's a kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need to have some way to execute code that triggers the vulnerability, which might require local access. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the validation process. If the attacker needs to interact with the system (like a user clicking a link or running a program), then UI is Required (R). But if the exploit can be triggered automatically without user interaction, then UI is None (N). The description doesn't mention user interaction, so I think UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel) that is being attacked. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed (C). But here, it's within the same component, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability allows the attacker to bypass the validation, which could lead to unauthorized access or execution. Since the check is bypassed, the attacker might be able to cause the system to process more protocols than intended, which could lead to information disclosure (C), data modification (I), or denial of service (A). However, the description doesn't specify which of these is affected. The original check was to validate the number of protocols, so if the check is bypassed, the system might process more data than expected, leading to potential buffer overflows or other issues. But the exact impact isn't clear. However, since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the check is bypassed, it's possible that the attacker could cause a denial of service (A) by making the system crash or hang. Alternatively, if the protocols are processed incorrectly, it might lead to information leakage (C) or data corruption (I). But without specific details, I need to make an educated guess. Since the vulnerability is about improper validation leading to a bypass, it's possible that the attacker could cause the system to process more data than intended, leading to a DoS. However, the original check was about the number of protocols, so maybe the attacker could inject more protocols, leading to unauthorized access (C) or modification (I). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the check is bypassed, the system might not handle the data correctly, leading to a crash (A). Given that, maybe the impact is on Availability (A) as High (H), but I'm not certain. However, the original check was about the number of protocols, which might be part of the firmware's operation. If the system processes more protocols than expected, it might lead to a crash or resource exhaustion, hence A: High. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the attacker can cause the system to process more data, leading to information disclosure, then C: High. But again, the description doesn't specify. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the check is bypassed, the impact could be high on all three. However, the CVSS guidelines state that if the vulnerability allows the attacker to cause a denial of service, then A is High. If it allows unauthorized access to data, then C is High. If it allows modification of data, then I is High. Since the description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is in the kernel, which is critical, I might have to assume that all three are High. But that's a bit of a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the impact is on Availability because the system might crash or become unstable. So A: High. But I'm not sure. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the CVSS guidelines again. The base score calculation for C, I, A depends on the impact. If the vulnerability allows the attacker to read data they shouldn't, then C is High. If they can modify data, I is High. If they can cause the system to stop functioning, A is High. Since the vulnerability is about a validation check being bypassed, which could lead to processing more data than intended, it's possible that the system could crash (A), but it's not certain. Alternatively, the attacker could inject malicious protocols, leading to unauthorized access (C) or modification (I). But without specific details, I think the safest assumption is that the impact is on Availability (A) as High, and maybe Confidentiality and Integrity as Low or None. However, I'm not confident. Alternatively, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to bypass the check, they might be able to cause the system to process more protocols, which could lead to a buffer overflow or other issues, leading to a DoS. So A: High. But again, this is speculative. Given the lack of specific information, I might have to assign C, I, A as High, but that's a common approach for kernel vulnerabilities. However, I need to be careful. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the firmware handling, which is part of the system's management. If the attacker can bypass the check, they might be able to cause the system to process more protocols than intended, which could lead to a denial of service (A: High). But if the protocols are processed correctly, maybe there's no impact on confidentiality or integrity. So perhaps only A is High. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the attacker can cause the system to process more protocols, they might be able to access data that's not supposed to be accessible, leading to C: High. But again, without specific info, this is hard. Maybe the best approach is to assign C, I, A as High, as the vulnerability is in the kernel and could have severe impacts. However, I need to check the CVSS guidelines again. The CVSS v3.1 base score calculation for impact uses the formula: Impact = 1.5 * (1 - (1 - C) * (1 - I) * (1 - A)). If all three are High, the impact is 1.5 * (1 - (1 - 1) * (1 - 1) * (1 - 1)) = 1.5 * 1 = 1.5. But if only A is High, then Impact = 1.5 * (1 - (1 - 0", "prediction": "", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

Such deadlock can happen in the following situation. When all journal buckets are fully filled by active jset with heavy write I/O load, the cache set registration (after a reboot) will load all active jsets and inserting them into the btree again (which is called journal replay). If a journaled bkey is inserted into a btree node and results btree node split, new journal request might be triggered. For example, the btree grows one more level after the node split, then the root node record in cache device super block will be upgrade by bch_journal_meta() from bch_btree_set_root(). But there is no space in journal buckets, the journal replay has to wait for new journal bucket to be reclaimed after at least one journal bucket replayed. This is one example that how the journal no-space deadlock happens. The solution to avoid the deadlock is to reserve 1 journal bucket in run time, and only permit the reserved journal bucket to be used during cache set registration procedure for things like journal replay. Then the journal space will never be fully filled, there is no chance for journal no-space deadlock to happen anymore. This patch adds a new member \"bool do_reserve\" in struct journal, it is inititalized to 0 (false) when struct journal is allocated, and set to 1 (true) by bch_journal_space_reserve() when all initialization done in run_cache_set(). In the run time when journal_reclaim() tries to allocate a new journal bucket, free_journal_buckets() is called to check whether there are enough free journal buckets to use. If there is only 1 free journal bucket and journal->do_reserve is 1 (true), the last bucket is reserved and free_journal_buckets() will return 0 to indicate no free journal bucket. Then journal_reclaim() will give up, and try next time to see whetheer there is free journal bucket to allocate. By this method, there is always 1 jouranl bucket reserved in run time. During the cache set registration, journal->do_reserve is 0 (false), so the reserved journal bucket can be used to avoid the no-space deadlock.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the vulnerability described in the CVE. The issue is in the Linux kernel's bcache module, specifically a deadlock scenario during journal replay when there's no space in the journal buckets. The fix reserves one journal bucket to prevent this deadlock.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is related to the kernel's bcache, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel-level issue, the attack vector is likely Local (L) because it requires access to the system to exploit it. However, wait, the problem is in the kernel, but does it require any network access? The description doesn't mention network exposure. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a deadlock that occurs under specific conditions during journal replay. Exploiting this would require precise conditions, like heavy write I/O load and specific system states. That sounds like High (H) complexity because it's not straightforward to trigger.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): To exploit this, an attacker would need to have some level of access to the system. Since it's a kernel vulnerability, maybe it's a local privilege escalation? But the description doesn't mention that. The deadlock is during cache set registration, which might be part of the system's internal processes. If an attacker can trigger this during a reboot or under certain conditions, maybe they need local access. So PR is probably High (H) because it requires some level of system access, but I'm not sure. Wait, the fix is about reserving a journal bucket during cache set registration. If an attacker can cause the system to enter that state, maybe they need local privileges. So PR is High (H).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability occurs during system operations like reboot or heavy I/O. It doesn't require user interaction, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel's bcache), so the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability is a deadlock that could cause the system to hang or crash during journal replay. This affects availability. However, the description doesn't mention data leakage or integrity issues. So C and I are None (N), and A is High (H) because the system might become unavailable if the deadlock occurs.\n\nWait, but the problem is a deadlock that prevents the system from proceeding with journal replay. If the system can't complete the journal replay, it might not boot properly or have data corruption. But the fix prevents the deadlock, so the original vulnerability's impact is on availability. So A is High (H), C and I are None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: H (High)\nPR: H (High)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.4000000000000004, "success": true}

According to Documentation/admin-guide/mm/numaperf.rst: \"Some memory may share the same node as a CPU, and others are provided as memory only nodes.\" Therefore, some node CPU masks may be empty and wouldn't have a \"first CPU\".

[ bp: Massage commit message, fix typo. ]\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the vulnerability described in the CVE. The issue is in the Linux kernel related to handling microcode updates on AMD systems with CPU-less NUMA nodes. The problem arises when the code accesses per-CPU data for nodes that don't have any CPUs, leading to an out-of-bounds array access. However, the description mentions that this doesn't have security implications because flashing microcode is a privileged operation. But there's a reliability issue, possibly corrupting memory during a microcode update.\n\nNow, the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, and microcode updates are typically done by privileged users. However, the attack vector here might be through a system with specific hardware configurations. But since the issue is in the kernel code, and the attack would require a privileged operation (like flashing microcode), maybe the attack vector is Local (L)? Wait, but the user might need to have access to the system to perform the microcode update. However, the original code is part of the kernel, so if an attacker can exploit this, maybe it's a local privilege escalation? But the description says it's a reliability issue, not a security vulnerability. However, the CVSS calculation might still consider it based on the potential for exploitation.\n\nWait, the CVE description says \"This does not have any security implications since flashing microcode is a privileged operation.\" So the vulnerability isn't exploitable for security purposes because it requires privileged access. But the problem is a reliability issue. However, for CVSS, even if it's a reliability issue, if it can be exploited, we need to assess that. But since the description says there are no security implications, maybe the CVSS is not applicable? But the user is asking to calculate the base score regardless.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vulnerability is not exploitable for security purposes, so the base score would be low. Let me think again. The CVSS base score is based on the inherent characteristics of the vulnerability, not on the likelihood of exploitation. So even if the vulnerability is not exploitable, the base score would still be calculated based on the metrics.\n\nBut in this case, the vulnerability is a buffer overflow or out-of-bounds access. However, the exploit would require a specific setup (CPU-less NUMA nodes, and the microcode update process). The attack vector (AV) would be Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the system to perform the microcode update. But if the microcode update is done by the system itself during boot, maybe it's a local issue. However, the attack vector is determined by how the vulnerability is triggered. Since the code is part of the kernel, and the vulnerability is triggered during a microcode update, which is a privileged operation, the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker would need local access to the system to perform the microcode update.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds access. If the attacker can trigger this by performing a microcode update, which is a specific action, but the complexity might be Low (L) if it's straightforward. However, since the microcode update is a privileged operation, maybe the attacker needs to have the ability to perform that, which might be considered as requiring some level of privilege. But the AC metric is about the complexity of the attack, not the privileges required. If the attack can be triggered with a simple action (like a specific microcode update), then AC is Low. But if it's complex, then High. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel code, and the attack is a specific scenario (CPU-less NUMA nodes), maybe the attack complexity is Low because it's a specific condition that can be triggered once the system is set up that way.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The description says that flashing microcode is a privileged operation. So the attacker would need to have privileges to perform the microcode update. Therefore, PR is High (H) because the attacker needs high-level privileges. However, if the microcode update is done automatically by the system during boot, maybe the attacker doesn't need to have privileges. But the vulnerability is in the code that handles the microcode update, so the attacker would need to have the ability to trigger the microcode update, which is a privileged operation. Therefore, PR is High (H).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered during a microcode update. If the microcode update is done automatically by the system, then user interaction is not required. However, if the attacker needs to interact with the system to perform the update, then UI would be Required (R). But the description mentions that when booting with CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS=y, the error is triggered. So the user might need to boot with that configuration, which could be a user action. However, the vulnerability itself is in the kernel code, and the exploit would require the user to perform the microcode update. But since the microcode update is a system-level operation, maybe UI is None (N) because it's done automatically. Alternatively, if the user has to manually trigger the microcode update, then UI is Required. But the description doesn't specify that user interaction is needed. It's more of a system-level process. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on the same component. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the impact is on the system's reliability, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects a different component, it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The description says there are no security implications, but the reliability issue could lead to memory corruption. However, for CVSS, we need to assess the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Since the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds access, it could potentially lead to memory corruption, which might allow an attacker to read or write arbitrary memory. However, the description says that the vulnerability doesn't have security implications, but the reliability issue is about corrupting memory. If the attacker can exploit this to gain unauthorized access, then C, I, A could be High. But since the vulnerability is not exploitable for security purposes (as per the description), maybe the impact metrics are None (N). However, the CVSS base score is based on the potential impact, not whether it's actually exploited. If the vulnerability could lead to a denial of service (memory corruption), then Availability (A) might be High. But the description says it's a reliability issue, not a security vulnerability. This is a bit tricky. The original code is part of the kernel, and the out-of-bounds access could lead to a crash or data corruption. If the attacker can trigger this, it might lead to a denial of service (availability), but since the attacker needs high privileges, maybe the impact is low. However, the CVSS metrics are based on the potential impact, not the exploitability. If the vulnerability could lead to a system crash (availability), then A is High. But the description says there are no security implications, so maybe the impact is None. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the vulnerability is a buffer overflow, the impact could be High for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. But the description says it's a reliability issue, not a security vulnerability. This is confusing. Maybe the impact metrics are None because the vulnerability doesn't allow unauthorized access, modification, or denial of service. However, the memory corruption could lead to a crash, which is a denial of service. But the CVSS impact metrics are based on the potential for the vulnerability to be exploited. If the vulnerability is not exploitable (as per the description), then the impact metrics would be None. But the CVSS base score is calculated based on the inherent characteristics, not the exploitability. So even if the vulnerability is not exploitable, the impact metrics would still be considered. However, the description says there are no security implications, so maybe the impact is None. But I'm not certain. This is a point where I might need to make an educated guess. If the vulnerability could lead to a system crash (availability), then A is High. But if the impact is not exploitable, then maybe it's None. However, the CVSS base score is calculated based on the potential for impact, not whether it's actually exploitable. So if the vulnerability could lead to a denial of service, then A is High. But the description says it's a reliability issue, not a security vulnerability. This is conflicting. Maybe the impact is None because the vulnerability doesn't allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access, modify data, or cause a denial of service. But the memory corruption could lead to a crash, which is a denial of service. However, the attacker would need to have the ability to trigger the microcode update, which is a privileged operation. So the impact is limited to the system's reliability, but not a security vulnerability. Therefore, the impact metrics (C, I, A) are None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't allow an attacker to exploit it for security purposes. However, the CVSS base score might still consider the potential impact. This is a bit ambiguous. I think the correct approach here is to set C, I, A to None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't have security implications as per the description. Even though there's a reliability issue, the CVSS metrics are about security impacts. Therefore, the impact metrics are None.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 7.8, "success": true}

While reading sysctl_icmp_echo_enable_probe, it can be changed concurrently. Thus, we need to add READ_ONCE() to its readers.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. The CVE is about a data race in the Linux kernel related to sysctl_icmp_echo_enable_probe. The fix involved adding READ_ONCE() to prevent concurrent changes while reading the variable.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each metric based on the description. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel-level issue, it's likely exploitable remotely. But wait, data races might not be directly exploitable unless there's a way to trigger them. However, the fix suggests that the variable is being read and modified concurrently. If an attacker can manipulate the sysctl parameter while it's being read, maybe through some system call or configuration change, that could be a remote attack. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a local issue. Hmm. Wait, sysctl parameters can be modified by users with appropriate privileges. If the vulnerability allows for a race condition that could be exploited by a local user, then AV might be Local (L). But if it's a remote exploit, like through a network service, then Network (N). The description doesn't mention remote exploitation, just a data race in the kernel. So maybe it's a local issue. But I'm not certain. Let me think again. Data races in the kernel can sometimes be exploited by local users with elevated privileges. So AV might be Local (L). But I need to check if there's a way for a remote attacker to exploit this. If the sysctl is accessible via a network service, maybe. But the sysctl interface is typically local. So I think AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Data races can be complex to exploit. The attacker would need to precisely time their actions to trigger the race condition. So AC is likely High (H). But if the race is easy to exploit, maybe Low. However, without specific details, High is safer.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): To modify sysctl parameters, a user typically needs root or administrative privileges. So if the vulnerability requires the attacker to have high privileges, then PR is High (H). But if the sysctl is accessible without elevated privileges, maybe Low or None. However, sysctl settings are usually modified by users with sudo or root access. So PR is High (H). Wait, but the vulnerability itself might not require privileges. Wait, the data race occurs when reading the sysctl variable. If the attacker can trigger the race by changing the sysctl value while it's being read, they might need to have the ability to modify that sysctl. That would require privileges. So PR is High (H).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): If the exploit requires the user to perform an action, like clicking a link or opening a file, then UI is Required (R). But in this case, the data race might be exploitable without user interaction. If the attacker can trigger the race through a system call or by modifying the sysctl parameter, then UI is None (N). So I think UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects a different component, it would be Changed (C). But here, it's within the same scope, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The data race might lead to information leakage if the variable is read incorrectly. However, the fix is about preventing data races, not about leaking data. So maybe C is None (N) unless the race could expose sensitive information. But the description doesn't mention confidentiality impact. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, if the race allows for incorrect values to be read, maybe leading to incorrect behavior, but not necessarily corrupting data. However, if the sysctl parameter is used for something critical, a race might allow for unexpected behavior. But the description doesn't specify integrity impact. So I might be None (N) or Low (L). But without clear evidence, I'll go with None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): If the race condition could cause a denial of service, like a crash or hang. The fix is to prevent data races, which might prevent such issues. But the original vulnerability might not directly impact availability. So A is None (N).\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. The data race could lead to undefined behavior, which might cause the system to crash or behave unpredictably. If that's the case, then Availability (A) could be High (H) if the system becomes unavailable. However, the description doesn't mention availability impact. So without explicit info, I think A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: H (High)\nPR: H (High)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake with AV. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, but the sysctl is accessible via a network service, maybe AV is Network. However, sysctl is typically a local interface. So I think AV is Local (L) is correct.\n\nBut let me check again. The vulnerability is in the kernel's handling of sysctl_icmp_echo_enable_probe. To exploit this, an attacker would need to modify the sysctl parameter, which requires root or administrative privileges. So the attack vector is local. Therefore, AV is Local (L).\n\nSo the final vector would be:\n\nAV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N\n\nBut wait, the CVSS v3.1 base score calculation might have different values. Let me check if the metrics are correct. For example, if the vulnerability is in the kernel, but the exploit requires local access, then AV is Local. However, sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger them through a network service. But in this case, the data race is in the sysctl handling, which is a local configuration. So I think AV is Local (L) is correct.\n\nAnother point: the Privileges Required (PR) is High because modifying sysctl parameters requires elevated privileges. So PR is High (H).\n\nSo the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N\n\nBut I need to confirm each metric again. Let me go through each one once more.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): Local (L) because the sysctl is a local configuration interface.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H) because exploiting a data race requires precise timing and specific conditions.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): High (H) because modifying sysctl parameters requires root access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): None (N) because the exploit doesn't require user interaction.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability is within the same component (kernel).\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N) as there's no mention of data leakage.\n\nIntegrity (I): None (N) as there's no mention of data corruption.\n\nAvailability (A): None (N) as there's no mention of denial of service.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

The vulnerability occurs in the view for inspecting detailed run information, where a user-controllable string (run ID) is appended and rendered as HTML. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a stored XSS in modelscope/agentscope. The issue is that a user-controllable string (run ID) is appended and rendered as HTML without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the XSS is stored and the run ID is user-controllable, the attack can be initiated via a web request. The attacker doesn't need physical access or adjacent network; it's over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is about how complex the attack is. Stored XSS typically requires the attacker to inject the malicious script into the application, which might be straightforward if the input isn't sanitized. Since the run ID is directly rendered as HTML, the attack might be low complexity. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) refers to the level of access the attacker needs. For stored XSS, the attacker usually doesn't need any special privileges beyond being a regular user who can input the run ID. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is whether the user needs to interact for the attack to succeed. In stored XSS, the user doesn't need to do anything; the malicious script is executed when they view the page. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. Since the XSS is in the same application context (the view for run details), the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. XSS can lead to data theft (confidentiality), data modification (integrity), and potentially denial of service (availability). However, the primary impact here is on confidentiality and integrity. Since the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript, they can steal session cookies (C: High), modify page content (I: High), and maybe cause the page to crash (A: High). But availability might be less certain unless the XSS is used to trigger a DoS. However, the description doesn't mention availability, so maybe A is High if the attacker can cause the page to crash, but I'm not sure. Wait, the standard for CVSS is that if the vulnerability can be used to cause a denial of service, then A is High. But stored XSS typically affects confidentiality and integrity more. However, the CVSS guidelines might consider that if the attack can be used to cause a DoS, then A is High. But the description doesn't mention that. Hmm. Maybe the availability is not impacted here. Wait, the original description says the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript. That could include things like redirecting the user, stealing data, but not necessarily causing the service to be unavailable. So maybe A is None (N). But I need to check the CVSS guidelines. According to NIST, for XSS, the impact on availability is usually not present unless the attack can be used to cause a DoS. Since the description doesn't mention that, I think A is None (N). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check again. The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript, which can lead to data exfiltration (C: High), data modification (I: High), but not necessarily availability. So A is None (N). Wait, but maybe the attacker can cause the page to crash, but that's not specified. So I think A is None (N). However, some sources might consider that XSS can be used to cause DoS, but without explicit mention, it's safer to assume A is None. So C: High, I: High, A: None.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N\nAC: L\nPR: N\nUI: N\nS: U\nC: H\nI: H\nA: N\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 3.0, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the WPExperts Square For GiveWP plugin for WordPress. The issue is an SQL injection via the 'post' parameter in versions up to 1.3.1. The problem arises from insufficient escaping of user-supplied parameters and lack of proper SQL query preparation. The attacker needs to be authenticated with Subscriber-level access or higher to exploit this.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is exploitable via a parameter in a web application, which is accessible over the network. So AV should be Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description mentions that the attacker needs to append SQL queries, which might require some understanding but doesn't seem to involve complex steps. However, SQL injection typically requires crafting specific payloads, which might be considered low complexity. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs Subscriber-level access, which is a low privilege level in WordPress. So PR is Low (L). Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). Since the attacker needs some privileges (Subscriber), it's Low, not None. So PR is L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is exploited through a parameter in a request, which doesn't require user interaction. The attacker can send a crafted request without needing the user to do anything. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the plugin) that's being attacked. Since the attack is within the same security scope, S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability allows extraction of sensitive information, which impacts confidentiality. It could also allow modifying data (integrity) or causing denial of service (availability), but the description specifically mentions extracting information. However, SQL injection can often lead to all three impacts. But the description says \"extract sensitive information,\" so C is High. For I and A, the description doesn't mention modifying data or disrupting availability, so they might be None. Wait, but sometimes SQL injection can be used to alter data or cause crashes. However, the CVE description only mentions extracting information. So maybe C is High, I and A are None. But I need to check if the vulnerability allows for those as well. Since the description doesn't mention them, it's safer to assume only confidentiality is affected. So C=H, I=N, A=N.\n\nWait, but the CVSS guidelines say that if the vulnerability can be used to impact any of the three, even if not explicitly stated, you should consider it. However, the CVE description only mentions extracting information. So I think C is High, I and A are None. But maybe the attacker could also modify data or delete it, but the description doesn't say that. So I'll stick with C=H, I=N, A=N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N\nAC: L\nPR: L\nUI: N\nS: U\nC: H\nI: N\nA: N\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the Privileges Required is correct. The attacker needs Subscriber access, which is a low privilege. So PR is Low (L). Yes. And User Interaction is None because the attack is done via a parameter in a request, not requiring user action.

The attack can be initiated remotely, and the exploit is public.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attack can be initiated remotely, which typically means over the network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The vulnerability allows SSRF through argument manipulation. If the attack requires specific conditions or complex steps, AC would be High.

The UI metric is about whether the user needs to be tricked into doing something. Since the attack is remote and doesn't require user action beyond using the service, UI might be None (N). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check again. The description says \"Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.\" So maybe the user interaction is required if the service is being used by the user. However, in a remote code execution scenario, the attacker is the one interacting with the service, not the user. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. Since the exploit is within the same process context, the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution, which can lead to complete compromise of the system. So all three are High (H). The attacker can read, modify, or disrupt the system's availability.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:H.

While reading sysctl_tcp_early_retrans, it can be changed concurrently. Thus, we need to add READ_ONCE() to its reader.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. The CVE description is about a data race in the Linux kernel related to sysctl_tcp_early_retrans. The fix involved adding READ_ONCE() to the reader to prevent concurrent changes during reading.\n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel-level issue, it's likely that an attacker would need local access to exploit it. However, sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger them via network. But in this case, the data race is about a sysctl parameter, which is typically accessed via the sysctl interface. Sysctl is usually accessible through the file system (like /proc/sys) or via sysctl commands, which are local. So I think AV is Local (L). But wait, could this be exploited remotely? If an attacker can send packets that trigger the race condition, maybe. But the description doesn't mention that. It just says that during reading, the value can be changed concurrently. So maybe it's a local issue. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The data race might require specific conditions to be triggered. If the attacker needs to have precise timing or specific inputs to cause the race, that's high complexity. But if it's a straightforward race condition that can be exploited with minimal effort, it's low. However, data races can be tricky to exploit. But since the fix is adding READ_ONCE(), which is a synchronization primitive, maybe the exploit would require some level of complexity. But I'm not sure. Maybe AC is Low (L) because the vulnerability is a data race that could be exploited with a simple concurrent access. But I need to think. If the attacker can trigger the race by having two threads (or processes) accessing the sysctl parameter, maybe that's not too complex. So AC might be Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Since the sysctl parameter is accessible to local users, the attacker would need local privileges. However, if the sysctl is accessible without elevated privileges, maybe PR is None (N). Wait, sysctl parameters can be modified by users with appropriate permissions. For example, some sysctls require root access. If this particular sysctl requires root, then PR would be High (H). But if it's a user-accessible sysctl, then PR could be Low (L) or None (N). The description doesn't specify, but in the Linux kernel, sysctl parameters are usually under /proc/sys, and some require root. However, the data race is during reading, so maybe the attacker just needs to read it while it's being changed. If the attacker can run code that reads the sysctl while another process is changing it, they might need local access but not necessarily root. But if the sysctl is protected, then PR would be High. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. But since the fix is in the kernel, and the vulnerability is a data race, it's possible that the attacker needs local access but not necessarily elevated privileges. So maybe PR is Low (L) or None (N). Wait, if the attacker can run code on the system, they can access the sysctl. So if the attacker has user-level access, they can read the sysctl. So PR might be None (N) because no special privileges are needed beyond normal user access. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the sysctl requires root to modify, but the vulnerability is in reading it. If the attacker can read it, maybe they don't need privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a data race that occurs during reading. If the attacker needs to interact with the system (like running a specific command or application), then UI is Required (R). But if the vulnerability can be exploited automatically without user interaction, then UI is None (N). Since the data race is a concurrency issue, it might require the attacker to have two processes or threads accessing the sysctl parameter. If the attacker can trigger this via a local exploit without user interaction, then UI is None. But if the exploit requires the user to perform an action, then it's Required. The description doesn't mention user interaction, so I think UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component. So the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects a different component, it would be Changed (C). Since it's a kernel issue, S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The data race could lead to reading incorrect values, but does that affect confidentiality? If the sysctl parameter is supposed to be a certain value, but due to the race, it's read as a different value, maybe that could leak information. However, the description doesn't mention confidentiality impact. The fix is to prevent data races, which might prevent incorrect data from being read. But if the data race allows an attacker to read a value that's being changed, maybe that's a confidentiality issue. However, I'm not sure. The original vulnerability might not directly impact confidentiality. So maybe C is None (N). But if the data race could allow an attacker to read a value that's supposed to be protected, then maybe C is Low or High. But without more info, I think C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): The data race might allow the attacker to write incorrect values, but the vulnerability is about reading during a change. The fix is to prevent the race during reading, not writing. So maybe the integrity impact is None (N). Unless the race could lead to incorrect values being used, which might affect the system's integrity. But again, the description doesn't mention that. So I think I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The data race might cause the system to crash or behave unpredictably, but the description doesn't mention availability issues. The fix is to prevent a data race, which could prevent a crash or other availability issues. However, without explicit mention, A is None (N).\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. The data race could lead to a use-after-free or other issues that might cause a denial of service. However, the description only mentions the data race and the fix. So unless the data race leads to a crash, which isn't stated, A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) because the vulnerability is in the kernel and requires local access to exploit.\nAC: Low (L) because the data race might be exploitable with minimal effort.\nPR: None (N) because the attacker can access the sysctl without elevated privileges.\nUI: None (N) because no user interaction is required.\nS: Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability is within the same component.\nC: None (N) because there's no mention of confidentiality impact.\nI: None (N) because the issue is a data race, not an integrity issue.\nA: None (N) because no availability impact is mentioned.\n\nWait, but maybe the data race could lead to a crash, which would affect availability. However, the description doesn't state that. So without explicit info, I think A is None (N).\n\nSo the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N\n\nBut wait, the original fix is about a data race. In some cases, data races can be exploited to cause denial of service or other issues. However, the CVE description doesn't mention any impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability. The fix is to prevent the data race, which might prevent a potential exploit. But without knowing the actual impact, the base metrics are based on the vulnerability's potential impact. If the data race could be exploited to cause a crash, then A would be High or Low. But since the description doesn't mention that, maybe the impact is None. However, in some cases, data races are considered as having a high impact because they can be exploited to cause arbitrary code execution. But again, the description doesn't mention that. So I think the correct approach is to assign the metrics based on the given information. Since the vulnerability is a data race that's fixed by adding a synchronization primitive, but the impact isn't specified, the base metrics might be set to None for C, I, A. However, sometimes data races are considered as having a high impact because they can be exploited for various issues. But without explicit info, I think the safest is to assign None for all three.\n\nBut wait, the CVSS v3.1 base score calculation requires that if the vulnerability can be exploited to cause a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability, then those metrics are set accordingly. If the data race could lead to a denial of service, then A would be High or Low. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think the correct approach is to set all three to None unless there's evidence of impact.\n\nTherefore, the final vector string would be:\n\nAV:L, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:N\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 4.7, "success": true}

Successful exploitation could allow an authenticated low privilege operator user to change the state of certain settings of a vulnerable system.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a privilege escalation in the web-based management interface of HPE Aruba Networking Fabric Composer. An authenticated low-privilege user can change certain system settings.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in a web-based management interface, which is accessible over the network. So AV is likely Network (N) because it doesn't require physical access or adjacent network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says \"low privilege operator user\" can exploit it. If it's a simple exploit that doesn't require complex steps, AC is Low (L). If it needed specific conditions, maybe High, but here it's just changing settings, so probably Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user needs to be authenticated as a low-privilege operator. So PR is Low (L), since they need some access but not high privileges. Wait, but the options are None, Low, High. Since the user is authenticated, but with low privileges, PR is Low (L). If it required no authentication, it would be None, but here it's authenticated, so PR is Low.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The exploit requires the user to be authenticated and interact with the interface. But the description doesn't mention if user interaction is needed beyond authentication. However, since it's a web interface, maybe the user has to perform an action, so UI is Required (R). Wait, but the vulnerability is that an authenticated user can change settings. If the exploit is automatic once authenticated, maybe UI is None. Hmm, this is tricky. The UI metric is about whether user interaction is required for the attack. If the user has to click a button or input something, then Required. If the attack can be done automatically once the user is authenticated, maybe UI is None. The description says \"successful exploitation could allow an authenticated low privilege operator user to change the state...\" So the user is already authenticated, and the exploit is triggered by their actions. So UI might be None because the user is already authenticated and the attack is part of their interaction. Wait, but the UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the user has to perform an action (like clicking a link), then UI is Required. If the attack is automatic once the user is authenticated, maybe UI is None. The description doesn't specify, but since it's a web interface, maybe the user has to interact with it. So I think UI is Required (R). But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is None if the attack is triggered through the existing authenticated session without further interaction. Hmm. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. UI is Required if the attack requires the user to perform an action, like clicking a link or entering data. If the vulnerability is that the user can exploit it through their existing authenticated session without additional steps, then UI is None. But if the exploit requires the user to perform an action (like sending a specific request), then UI is Required. The description says \"change the state of certain settings\", which might be done via an API call or form submission. So maybe UI is Required. But I'm not certain. Let me tentatively go with Required (R) here.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the management interface) that the user is interacting with. So the scope is Unchanged (U), because the attack doesn't affect a different component. If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed (C). Here, it's within the same system, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability allows changing settings, which affects integrity. So I is High (H). Confidentiality and Availability aren't mentioned, so they are None (N). Wait, but changing settings could affect availability if the settings are critical. However, the description doesn't mention that. So C and A are N, I is H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but the UI might be None. Let me recheck. If the user is already authenticated, and the exploit is part of their normal operations, then maybe UI is None. For example, if the user can just send a request to change the settings without any additional interaction beyond their existing session. In that case, UI is None. But if the exploit requires the user to perform an action (like visiting a specific URL), then UI is Required. The description says \"change the state of certain settings\", which might be done via an API call that the user can make once authenticated. So maybe UI is None. But I'm still a bit confused. Let me look up the CVSS 3.1 UI metric. UI is Required if the attack requires the user to interact with the system, such as clicking a link or entering data. If the attack is initiated by the user's existing authenticated session without further interaction, then UI is None. Since the user is already authenticated, and the exploit is part of their actions, maybe UI is None. So I'll adjust that to UI: N.\n\nSo revised metrics:\n\nAV: N\nAC: L\nPR: L\nUI: N\nS: U\nC: N\nI: H\nA: N\n\nNow, the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. Wait, but the initial thought was UI: R. This is a critical point. Let me think again. The vulnerability is that an authenticated user can change settings. If the user is already authenticated, and the exploit is triggered by their actions (like sending a specific request), then UI is None because the user is already authenticated and the attack is part of their interaction. However, if the attack requires the user to perform an action (like visiting a specific page or clicking a link), then UI is Required. The description doesn't specify, but in many cases, if the user is authenticated and the exploit is part of their normal operations, UI is None. For example, if the user can send a request to change settings, that's part of their interaction. But if the exploit requires the user to be tricked into clicking a link, then UI is Required. Since the description doesn't mention social engineering or user interaction beyond authentication, I think UI is None. So UI: N.\n\nTherefore, the final vector string would be:\n\nAV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N\n\nBut wait, the Integrity impact is High because the vulnerability allows changing settings, which could compromise the integrity of the system. So I is H.

This hole is never initialized. Initialize the struct to zero before using it to avoid pushing uninitialized information to userspace.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the iio: pressure: zpa2326 driver. The issue is an information leak in the triggered buffer because a struct called'sample' has a gap between the temperature and timestamp fields. This gap isn't initialized, so when data is pushed to user space, uninitialized data might be sent.\n\nSo, the problem is that the struct isn't properly initialized, leading to potential leakage of uninitialized data to userspace. Now, I need to map this to the CVSS metrics.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and the data is being sent to user space, but the attack would require some interaction. However, the vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the system. But the attack vector here might be local because it's a kernel module. Wait, but the data is being sent to user space, so maybe it's a local exploit. But the user space application is using the driver, so the attacker would need to have access to the system. So AV is probably Local (L) or maybe Adjacent (A)? Wait, Adjacent is for things like Bluetooth or local network. Since it's a kernel module, the attack would be local. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to a missing initialization of a struct. Exploiting this would require the attacker to trigger the buffer and read the uninitialized data. That might be low complexity because it's a straightforward memory leak. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): To exploit this, the attacker would need to have some privileges. Since it's a kernel module, maybe the attacker needs to be a local user with some access. But if the driver is accessible via user space, maybe the attacker can trigger the buffer without high privileges. However, the kernel is protected, so maybe the attacker needs to have root or some elevated privileges. Wait, but the vulnerability is in the kernel, so to exploit it, the attacker would need to have access to the system. If the attacker is a local user, they might be able to exploit it. So PR could be None (N) if the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe Low (L) if some privileges are needed. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Since the data is being sent to user space, maybe the attacker can exploit it via a user-space application, so they might not need elevated privileges. But the kernel is protected, so maybe the attacker needs to have some access. I think PR is Low (L) because the attacker might need to have access to the system, but not necessarily root. Or maybe None (N) if the vulnerability is in a part that's accessible without privileges. I'm a bit uncertain here. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the kernel, but the data is being sent to user space. So the attacker would need to have a way to trigger the buffer, which might be through a user-space application. So maybe the attacker doesn't need any privileges, just to run the application. So PR could be None (N). But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is PR: None (N) because the attacker can exploit it without needing any special privileges beyond normal user access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is an information leak. The attacker would need to interact with the system to trigger the buffer and read the data. So UI is Required (R) if the attacker needs to interact, but if the leak is automatic, maybe not. However, the user would need to run an application that uses the driver, so UI is Required (R). Wait, but the vulnerability is a leak, so the attacker might not need user interaction. For example, if the data is leaked automatically, the attacker could just read it. But in this case, the data is pushed to user space when the buffer is triggered. So the attacker would need to trigger the buffer, which might require some interaction. So UI is Required (R). But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe it's None (N) if the leak is automatic. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. UI is Required if the user must interact with the system for the attack to succeed. If the attacker can exploit it without user interaction, like through a service, then UI is None. But in this case, the attacker would need to run an application that uses the driver, which would require user interaction. So UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component as the user space. So the scope is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability is in the same component. If the vulnerability was in a different component, like a library, then S would be Changed (C). But here, it's within the kernel, so S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows leakage of information to user space. So the confidentiality impact is High (H) because the attacker can access data that shouldn't be accessible.\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability is an information leak, not a modification. So the integrity impact is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't affect availability. It's a leak, not a DoS. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) because the attack is local to the system.\nAC: Low (L) because the exploit is straightforward.\nPR: None (N) if the attacker can exploit it without privileges, but earlier I was uncertain. Wait, if the attacker is a local user, they might need some privileges. But the vulnerability is in the kernel, so maybe the attacker needs to have access to the system. However, the CVSS PR metric for None (N) is when no privileges are required. If the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, then PR is N. But if they need to be a local user, which is a privilege, then PR is Low (L). This is a point of confusion. Let me check the CVSS definition. PR: None (N) means no privileges are required. If the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any privileges, like a web application vulnerability that can be exploited via a browser. In this case, the attacker would need to have access to the system to run an application that uses the driver. So maybe PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to have some level of access. But if the system is compromised, the attacker can exploit it. However, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already on the system, then PR is None. But if the attacker needs to have some privileges to access the kernel, then PR is Low. This is tricky. Maybe the correct answer is PR: None (N) because the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attacker can exploit it without needing additional privileges beyond being a local user. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is a local user, they might have some privileges, but the vulnerability itself doesn't require elevated privileges. So maybe PR is None (N). Alternatively, if the attacker needs to have access to the system, which is a privilege, then PR is Low (L). I think in this case, since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attacker can exploit it by running a user-space application, the PR is None (N) because no additional privileges are needed beyond normal user access. So I'll go with PR: None (N).\n\nUI: Required (R) because the attacker needs to interact with the system to trigger the buffer.\n\nS: Unchanged (U) as the vulnerability is within the same component.\n\nC: High (H) because of the information leak.\n\nI: None (N) as there's no integrity impact.\n\nA: None (N) as there's no availability impact.\n\nSo the vector string would be:\n\nAV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n\nWait, but earlier I thought UI might be Required (R) or None (N). Let me confirm. If the attacker needs to run an application that uses the driver, that's user interaction. So UI is Required (R). So the final vector is:\n\nAV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n\nBut I need to check if the Attack Vector is Local (L) or Network (N).

Prior to version 1.8.180, there is a mass assignment vulnerability. The Customer object is updated using the fill() method, which processes fields such as channel and channel_id. However, the fill() method is called with all client-provided data, including unexpected values for channel and channel_id, leading to a mass assignment vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.180.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a mass assignment issue in FreeScout before version 1.8.180. The Customer object is updated using the fill() method, which processes fields like channel and channel_id. The problem is that the fill() method uses all client-provided data, including unexpected values for those fields, leading to the vulnerability.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is due to client-provided data being processed without proper validation. Since the data is coming from the client, which is over the network, the attack vector is likely Network (N). Unless there's a specific reason to think it's local or physical, but the description doesn't mention that. So AV is N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a mass assignment, which typically requires the attacker to send specific data to exploit. However, if the application is processing all client data without filtering, the attacker might not need complex steps. For example, just sending a crafted request with unexpected fields. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the Customer object update. If the attacker can send requests to the server without needing any authentication, then PR is None (N). But if the attacker needs to be authenticated to make the request, then it's Low or High. The description doesn't mention authentication requirements. However, mass assignment vulnerabilities often allow an attacker to modify data without needing elevated privileges, so PR is likely None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted request. If the attack requires the user to interact, like clicking a link, then UI is Required (R). But if it's a server-side issue that can be exploited without user interaction, like a remote code execution, then UI is None (N). The description doesn't mention user interaction, so I think UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component that's being attacked. Since the Customer object is part of the application's data, and the attack doesn't involve a different component or a different scope, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same application context.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The mass assignment could allow an attacker to modify data, but does it affect confidentiality? If the attacker can change data, like channel or channel_id, that might not directly impact confidentiality. However, if the vulnerability allows access to other data, then C could be High. But the description doesn't mention data exposure. So maybe C is None (N) unless the vulnerability allows reading data. Wait, the vulnerability is about updating the Customer object with unexpected values. That's more about integrity or availability. So maybe C is N.\n\nIntegrity (I): The mass assignment allows the attacker to modify the Customer object's fields, which could lead to unauthorized changes. That's a direct impact on integrity. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability might not directly impact availability unless the attack causes the service to crash. The description doesn't mention denial of service, so A is None (N).\n\nWait, but the problem is that the fill() method is called with all client-provided data, leading to unexpected values. If the attacker can set channel_id to a value that causes the system to behave incorrectly, maybe leading to a crash or resource exhaustion. But the description doesn't specify that. So unless there's a specific mention of availability impact, A is N.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but I need to check if the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to data. If the attacker can change the channel or channel_id, maybe they can access data they shouldn't. For example, if channel_id is used to determine which data is accessed, changing it could allow the attacker to read or modify other users' data. That would impact confidentiality. But the description says it's a mass assignment vulnerability, which typically allows the attacker to set fields they shouldn't be able to. So if the Customer object's fields include sensitive data, changing them could affect confidentiality. However, the description doesn't explicitly state that. It's possible that the vulnerability allows the attacker to modify the Customer object's data, which could be a data integrity issue. So maybe C is N, I is H, and A is N.\n\nAlternatively, if the vulnerability allows the attacker to change the channel_id to access other channels, that could be a confidentiality issue. But without explicit mention, it's safer to assume that the primary impact is on integrity. So I think the correct values are as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "score": 3.2, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The issue is in Arc before 1.26.1 on Windows. The problem is a bypass in site settings that allows websites with previously granted permissions to add new permissions when the user clicks anywhere on the website.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability allows websites to exploit this, which implies it's accessible over a network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says that the user just needs to click anywhere on the website. That seems low complexity because it doesn't require any specific steps beyond a simple user action. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The websites already have permissions granted by the user. So the attacker doesn't need to have any special privileges beyond what the user has already given. Therefore, PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The user has to click on the website for the exploit to work. So UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the application's site settings, which affects the same component. So the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): If the website can add new permissions, they might access data they shouldn't. So this could lead to a high impact on confidentiality. Hence, C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, adding new permissions could allow the website to modify data, so Integrity is also High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The description doesn't mention any impact on availability, like denial of service. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N.

The interface need to be released before unregistering hci device when usb disconnect. Removing BT usb dongle without properly releasing the interface may cause Kernel panic while unregister hci device.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to Bluetooth drivers, specifically the btusb driver for MediaTek devices. The issue arises when the USB disconnect happens without properly releasing a special interrupt interface used for ISO data transmission. If the interface isn't released before unregistering the hci device, it can lead to a kernel panic.\n\nNow, I need to map this to the CVSS metrics. Let's go through each metric one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is triggered when a user disconnects the USB dongle. Since this is a physical action, but the attack vector is through the network? Wait, no. Wait, the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attack is via disconnecting the USB device. But USB is a local interface. However, the attack vector here is not through the network. The user physically disconnecting the device is a local action. But in CVSS, the Attack Vector (AV) is about how the attacker reaches the vulnerable component. If the attacker can exploit this by disconnecting the USB device, which is a local action, then AV would be Local (L). But wait, maybe the attacker doesn't need to be physically present. If the attacker can cause the USB disconnect remotely, but that's unlikely. Typically, USB disconnect is a local action. So AV is Local (L). But I need to check if there's a way for an attacker to trigger this remotely. The description doesn't mention that. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability requires the attacker to disconnect the USB device. Is that considered low or high complexity? Disconnecting a USB device is a simple action, so AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs to have the ability to disconnect the USB device. If the user is a regular user, they can do that. But in a system, maybe the user needs to have some privileges. However, in most cases, unplugging a USB device is a physical action that doesn't require elevated privileges. So PR is None (N), because the attacker doesn't need any special privileges to perform the action. Wait, but if the user is a regular user, they can unplug the device. So PR is None (N) because no privileges are required. However, if the system requires administrative rights to access the USB device, but the description doesn't mention that. So I think PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attacker needs to interact with the system to disconnect the USB device. So UI is Required (R), because the user has to physically disconnect the device. However, if the attack can be triggered automatically without user interaction, then it would be None. But in this case, the user has to unplug the device, so UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel) that is being attacked. Since the issue is in the kernel and the exploit doesn't change the scope (i.e., it's not affecting a different component), S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability leads to a kernel panic, which might not directly impact confidentiality. However, a kernel panic could potentially allow an attacker to gain access to the system, but the description doesn't mention data exposure. So C is None (N).\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, the kernel panic might not directly affect data integrity. Unless the panic leads to data corruption, but the description doesn't specify that. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The kernel panic would cause the system to crash, which is a denial of service. So A is High (H), because the system becomes unavailable.\n\nWait, but the CVSS metrics for Availability: High (H) means that the vulnerability results in a complete loss of availability. A kernel panic would definitely cause the system to crash, so A is High (H).\n\nLet me double-check each metric:\n\nAV: Local (L) because the attack requires physical access to the USB device.\n\nAC: Low (L) because disconnecting the USB is a simple action.\n\nPR: None (N) because no privileges are needed to unplug the device.\n\nUI: Required (R) because the user must interact by unplugging the device.\n\nS: Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability is in the same component.\n\nC: None (N) as there's no confidentiality impact mentioned.\n\nI: None (N) as no integrity impact is mentioned.\n\nA: High (H) because the system crashes, leading to a denial of service.\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the example given in the problem has AV:N. Wait, maybe I made a mistake with AV. Let me re-examine the attack vector.\n\nThe attack vector is through the USB interface. In CVSS, the Attack Vector (AV) is categorized as Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), or Physical (P). The USB is a local interface, so AV is Local (L). However, if the attacker can exploit this via a network, but the description doesn't mention that. So AV is Local (L). But some might argue that if the USB is connected to a system, and the attacker can cause the disconnect, but that's a local action. So AV is L.\n\nBut wait, another thought: if the attacker is on the same network, but that's not the case here. The attack is via physical access to the USB device. So AV is Physical (P)? Wait, no. The Physical (P) is for attacks that require physical access to the device. But in this case, the attacker needs to unplug the USB device, which is a local action. However, the CVSS definition for AV: Local (L) is when the attacker has access to the local system (e.g., via a local user account). Physical (P) is when the attacker has physical access to the device. But in this case, the attacker needs to physically unplug the device, which is a physical action. So maybe AV is Physical (P). Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, according to the CVSS 3.1 documentation:\n\n- Network (N): The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any prior access to the target system, such as through a network.\n- Adjacent (A): The attacker has access to the local network segment (e.g., via Bluetooth, local area network).\n- Local (L): The attacker has access to the local system (e.g., via a local user account).\n- Physical (P): The attacker has physical access to the device.\n\nIn this case, the attacker needs to physically unplug the USB device. So that would be Physical (P). But wait, the USB is part of the system, so maybe it's considered a local attack. However, the act of unplugging is a physical action. So AV is Physical (P). But I'm not sure. Some sources might consider USB as a local attack vector. For example, if the attacker is a local user who can unplug the device, then AV is Local (L). But if the attacker needs to have physical access to the machine to unplug the device, then AV is Physical (P). The description says \"Removing BT usb dongle without properly releasing the interface may cause Kernel panic...\" So the attacker is removing the dongle, which is a physical action. Therefore, AV is Physical (P). But I'm not entirely certain. This is a point of confusion.\n\nAlternatively, if the attacker is a local user who can unplug the device, then AV is Local (L). But the act of unplugging is a physical action. However, in CVSS, the Attack Vector is about how the attacker reaches the component. If the attacker is a local user, then AV is Local. If the attacker needs to be physically present, then it's Physical. The description doesn't specify whether the attacker is a local user or needs physical access. But in most cases, unplugging a USB device would require physical access. Therefore, AV is Physical (P).\n\nBut I need to check the CVSS guidelines. According to NIST's CVSS documentation, Physical (P) is when the attacker has physical access to the device. So if the attacker needs to physically unplug the device, then AV is P. However, if the attacker is a local user who can perform the action via the system (e.g., through a script), then AV is L. But in this case, the action is physical, so AV is P.\n\nThis is a critical point. If AV is P, then the vector would be AV:P. But if it's L, then AV:L. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attack is triggered by unplugging the USB device. The attacker needs to have physical access to the device to unplug it. Therefore, AV is Physical (P). However, some might argue that the USB is part of the system, so it's a local attack. But the act of unplugging is a physical action. So I think AV is P.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check an example. For example, a vulnerability that requires the attacker to physically press a button would be AV:P. Similarly, unplugging a USB device would be AV:P. Therefore, I think AV is P.\n\nSo revising the metrics:\n\nAV: Physical (P)\nAC: Low (L)\nPR: None (N)\nUI: Required (R)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N)\nI: None (N)\nA: High (H)\n\nBut then the vector would be AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the TimeZoneCalculator WordPress plugin. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject scripts, which then execute when users access the affected pages.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in a WordPress plugin and the attack requires user interaction through the site, the attack vector is likely Network (N) because it's accessible over the network, not requiring physical access or adjacent systems.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps; just injecting the script through the shortcode would suffice. The vulnerability is straightforward once the attacker has the necessary access.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is Low (L) because the attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a lower privilege than administrative. However, wait, the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). Contributor-level access in WordPress is a specific role, but since it's not administrative, maybe it's considered Low. But the description says \"authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above,\" which implies that the attacker needs some level of authentication. So PR would be Low (L) because it's not requiring high privileges but not none either. Wait, but if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a requirement. However, in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges needed. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege, but the level is Low. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is Required (R) because the XSS is stored, but the execution requires the user to access the page where the script is injected. However, stored XSS typically doesn't require user interaction once the script is stored. Wait, no. Stored XSS is when the malicious script is stored on the server and executed when a user accesses the page. So the user interaction here is not required for the attack to occur once the script is stored. Wait, but the user has to access the page. However, in CVSS, UI is about whether user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. For stored XSS, the user interaction is not required once the script is stored. Wait, but the initial injection might require user interaction. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check. The CVSS 3.1 UI metric: \"None (N) if no user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. Required (R) if user interaction is required for the attack to be successful.\" In stored XSS, the attacker injects the script, and then any user visiting the page will execute it. So the attack doesn't require user interaction once the script is stored. However, the initial injection might require the attacker to have access to inject the script, which might involve some user interaction. Wait, but the UI metric is about the attack itself, not the initial setup. So if the attack can be triggered without any user interaction (like a server-side vulnerability), then UI is N. But in stored XSS, the user has to access the page, which is a form of user interaction. Wait, but the user interaction here is the victim's action. The CVSS UI metric is about whether the attacker needs the user to perform an action. For example, in a phishing attack, the user has to click a link. In stored XSS, the user doesn't need to do anything; the script executes when they load the page. So in that case, UI is None (N) because the attack doesn't require user interaction. Wait, but the user has to access the page. However, the CVSS UI metric is about whether the attacker needs the user to perform an action. If the attacker can inject the script and it executes automatically when the user visits the page, then UI is N. But if the attacker needs the user to click on a link or something, then it's R. So in this case, since it's stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact; the script runs when they access the page. Therefore, UI is None (N). Wait, but the initial injection might require the attacker to have contributor access, which is a privilege, but that's covered under PR. So UI is N.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability is in the same component (the plugin) and doesn't affect other components. The attack is within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are all High (H) because XSS can lead to stealing session cookies (confidentiality), altering content (integrity), and potentially causing denial of service (availability) if the script is malicious. However, the description doesn't mention availability impact, but XSS typically affects confidentiality and integrity. So C and I are H, and A is N unless the attack can cause availability issues. Since the description doesn't mention availability, A is N. Wait, but the problem says \"calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score\" based on the given description. The vulnerability allows arbitrary script injection, which can lead to stealing data (C), modifying content (I), but not necessarily affecting availability. So A is N. Therefore, C and I are H, A is N.\n\nWait, but the CVSS base metrics for confidentiality, integrity, and availability are each rated as None, Low, or High. For XSS, the primary impact is on confidentiality (stealing session data) and integrity (modifying content). Availability is not typically affected unless the script causes a DoS. Since the description doesn't mention availability, it's N. So C: H, I: H, A: N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low) because contributor-level access is required, which is a privilege but not high.\nUI: N (None) because the attack doesn't require user interaction once the script is stored.\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H\nI: H\nA: N\n\nWait, but the PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs contributor-level access. But in CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege. But contributor-level is a specific role. However, the options are None, Low, High. Since contributor is not administrative, it's considered Low. So PR is L.\n\nSo the vector string would be:\n\nAV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nWait, but the initial thought was UI: N. Let me confirm again. The UI metric is whether user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. In stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact with the attack; the script is stored and executed when they access the page. So UI is N. Therefore, the vector is as above.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me check the CVSS 3.1 UI metric definition again. The User Interaction metric is \"None (N) if no user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. Required (R) if user interaction is required for the attack to be successful.\" In stored XSS, the attack is successful once the script is stored, and the user doesn't need to do anything.

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is an Out-of-bounds Write in RT-Labs P-Net version 1.0.1 or earlier. The attacker can send a malicious RPC packet to induce a crash in IO devices using the library.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions sending a malicious RPC packet. RPC (Remote Procedure Call) typically implies network communication. So AV is likely Network (N). If it required physical access or local access, it would be different, but here it's over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, which might be exploitable with low complexity. If the attacker just needs to send a specific packet without much setup, AC is Low (L). High would require more steps or specific conditions, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any prior authentication or privileges. They just send the malicious packet. So PR is None (N). If it required admin rights or something, it would be different, but here it's straightforward.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack doesn't require any user interaction. The attacker can send the packet directly. So UI is None (N). If the user had to click a link or something, it would be Required (R), but that's not mentioned here.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the library used by IO devices. If the attack affects the same component (the library) that's part of the system, the scope is Unchanged (U). If it affects a different component, it would be Changed (C). Since the library is part of the system, I think S is Unchanged.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability causes a crash, which affects availability. The out-of-bounds write could lead to a denial of service. So Availability (A) is High (H). For Confidentiality and Integrity, the description doesn't mention data exposure or modification. The crash might not directly impact confidentiality or integrity, so those are None (N). However, if the crash could lead to unauthorized access or data corruption, but the description only mentions a crash, so I think C and I are N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. Wait, but the availability impact is High because the crash would make the device unavailable. So A is H. The other metrics are as above. Let me double-check each metric again to make sure I didn't miss anything. The attack vector is definitely network. Attack complexity is low. No privileges needed. No user interaction. Scope unchanged. Availability is high, others are none.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Simple Charts plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the'simple_chart' shortcode. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject scripts, which then execute when users access the affected pages.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is stored in the plugin, so the attack can be initiated via the web, which is a network-based attack. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is about how complex the attack is. Since the attacker just needs to inject the script through the shortcode, which is a straightforward method, I think AC is Low (L). No complex steps needed.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is the level of access needed. The description says authenticated attackers with contributor-level access. Contributor in WordPress can edit posts, but not necessarily other parts of the site. However, since they can inject scripts into pages, which are then executed by users, the required privilege is Low (L). Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege, but the PR metric in CVSS considers the level of privileges required. Since contributor-level access is a lower privilege than admin, but not none. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is whether the user needs to interact. Since it's a stored XSS, the user doesn't need to do anything; the script is executed when they access the page. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. Since the plugin is part of WordPress, and the attack is within the same application, the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. For XSS, the main impact is on integrity and confidentiality. The attacker can steal session cookies (C: High), inject malicious scripts (I: High), but availability isn't directly affected. So C: H, I: H, A: N.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Then the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but I need to check if PR is correct. The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a privilege, but in CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege, but the options are N, L, H. Since contributor is a lower privilege than admin, but not none, so PR is Low (L). That seems right.

A low privileged local attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to fully impersonating the user.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in Dell Avamar version 19.4 or later, specifically in the AUI (probably the Administration User Interface). The issue is an access token reuse vulnerability. The attacker is described as a low-privileged local user who could exploit this to fully impersonate the user.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions a local attacker. So AV should be Local (L). Because the attack doesn't require network access, just local access to the system.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability allows exploitation with low complexity. The attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps; just reuse the token. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker is low-privileged. The description says \"low privileged local attacker,\" so PR is Low (L). Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). Since the attacker needs some privileges, even if low, it's not None. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The description doesn't mention needing user interaction. The attack is done by the attacker, not requiring the user to do anything. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability is in the AUI, which is part of the same system. If the attack affects the same component, the scope is Unchanged (U). If it's a different component, it would be Changed (C). Since the attacker is impersonating the user within the same system, S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A). The result is \"fully impersonating the user.\" Impersonation would lead to unauthorized access, which affects confidentiality (C) and integrity (I). Availability might not be directly impacted unless the attack causes a denial of service, which isn't mentioned. So C and I are High (H), and A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together: AV:L, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:N. Let me check again. The attacker is local, low privilege, no user interaction.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request).\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the nosurf middleware for Go, which is a CSRF protection tool. The issue is that versions before 1.2.0 have a flaw where the middleware doesn't check the Referer header for same-origin when handling requests, allowing an attacker to bypass CSRF checks.\n\nSo, the attacker needs to control content on the target site or a subdomain. They can manipulate cookies, get the CSRF token, and then make cross-site requests. The fix was in version 1.2.0, and users can also use another middleware to check the Sec-Fetch-Site header.\n\nNow, I need to assign each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability can be exploited over the network because the attacker doesn't need physical access. They can use a subdomain or XSS to control content. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The attacker needs to have control over the content on the target or subdomain. But once they have that, the exploit is straightforward. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the target system. They just need to control the content, which might be possible via XSS. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack requires the user to interact with the malicious content, like clicking a link or visiting a page. But the description says the attacker can manipulate cookies and craft requests. However, the user might need to be tricked into visiting the attacker's site. Wait, the UI metric is whether user interaction is required. Since the attacker needs the user to interact (e.g., click a link), UI is Required (R). But wait, the description mentions that the attacker can manipulate cookies set for the target. If the user is already authenticated, maybe the user interaction is not required. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The vulnerability allows the attacker to bypass CSRF checks, which typically require the user to be tricked into making a request. So UI is Required (R) because the user has to be induced to visit the attacker's site. But the original description says that the attacker can control content on the target site or subdomain. If the attacker has control over the target site, maybe they can inject malicious code that automatically triggers the request without user interaction. Wait, but the vulnerability is in the CSRF protection. Normally, CSRF requires the user to be tricked into making a request, which is user interaction. However, if the attacker has control over the target site, they might be able to inject a script that automatically sends the request. But in this case, the attacker is using a subdomain or XSS to manipulate cookies. So maybe the user interaction is required. I think UI is Required (R) here.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (nosurf) and doesn't change the scope. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The attacker can bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on the user's behalf. This could lead to unauthorized access to data, so C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can manipulate data by making requests on behalf of the user, which could alter data. So I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't directly impact the availability of the service. It's about unauthorized actions, not making the service unavailable. So A is None (N).\n\nWait, but the description mentions that the attacker can manipulate cookies and craft requests. If they can modify data, that's integrity. But availability isn't mentioned. So A is None.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N, AC: L, PR: N, UI: R, S: U, C: H, I: H, A: N.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought UI might be Required. Let me check again. The user needs to be tricked into visiting the attacker's site (like a phishing link), which requires user interaction. So UI is Required (R). But some sources might say that if the attack can be done without user interaction, like through a network exploit, but in this case, it's CSRF, which typically requires user interaction. So UI is R.\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.\n\nWait, but the original answer example had all H for C, I, A. But in this case, A is N. Let me confirm again. The vulnerability allows the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, which affects confidentiality and integrity, but not availability.

Fix this use-after-free issue by dropping of_node_put() in adv7533_parse_dt() and calling of_node_put() in error path of probe() and also in the remove().\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to analyze the CVE description and calculate the CVSS v3.1 base score. First, I need to understand the vulnerability described. The CVE is about a use-after-free issue in the Linux kernel's DRM code. The problem is that a pointer (host_node) is assigned and then freed in adv7533_parse_dt(), but later used in adv7533_attach_dsi(). The fix involves removing of_node_put() in parse_dt and adding it in error paths.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the CVSS v3.1 base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel-level issue, it's likely exploitable remotely. But wait, the description doesn't mention network access. However, kernel vulnerabilities can often be exploited via local access, like through a user-space application. But sometimes, if the kernel module is loaded via a driver, maybe it's adjacent? Hmm. Wait, the vulnerability is in the DRM code, which is part of the kernel. Exploiting a use-after-free in the kernel typically requires local access, as the attacker would need to run code that triggers the vulnerability. So AV is probably Local (L) or maybe Adjacent (A) if it's a device driver. But I think for kernel vulnerabilities, unless it's a network service, AV is usually Local. So I'll go with AV: Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Use-after-free vulnerabilities often require precise conditions to exploit. The attacker needs to control the memory that's being freed and then reused. This might be considered high complexity because it requires specific steps. But sometimes, if the vulnerability is in a widely used part of the kernel, maybe it's low. However, in this case, the fix is about a specific function. So maybe AC is High (H). Wait, but the CVSS guide says that if the attack requires multiple steps or specific conditions, it's high. Since use-after-free can be complex to exploit, I think AC is High (H).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): To exploit a kernel vulnerability, the attacker typically needs root or high privileges. However, if the vulnerability is in a user-space component, maybe lower. But since this is a kernel module, the attacker would need to have local access with elevated privileges. So PR is High (H). Wait, but if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that can be triggered by a user-space application, maybe the required privileges are low. Wait, but in the kernel, even if you have a user-space app, you need to have the ability to trigger the code path that leads to the use-after-free. That might require some level of privilege. However, in some cases, if the vulnerability is in a driver that's accessible via a device, maybe it's lower. But I think for kernel vulnerabilities, PR is usually High (H) because you need to have the ability to execute code in the kernel, which typically requires root. But maybe in this case, since it's a use-after-free, the attacker might not need high privileges. Wait, no. Exploiting a use-after-free in the kernel would require the attacker to have the ability to trigger the code that leads to the vulnerability. If the code is part of a driver that's accessible via a device, maybe the attacker can do it with lower privileges. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without needing any special privileges, then PR is None. If they need low (like a normal user), then Low. High would be like needing admin rights. Since this is a kernel vulnerability, I think the attacker would need to have local access, which might require some privileges. But maybe the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that can be triggered by a user-space application, so the attacker doesn't need high privileges. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Maybe PR is Low (L) because the attacker can exploit it with normal user privileges. Wait, but in the kernel, even if you have a user-space app, you need to have the ability to trigger the code that leads to the use-after-free. That might require some level of access. I think for kernel vulnerabilities, PR is usually High (H) because you need to have the ability to execute code in the kernel, which typically requires root. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should check some examples. For example, a kernel vulnerability that can be triggered by a user-space application might have PR: Low. But I'm not certain. Let me think again. The PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without needing any special privileges (like a normal user), then PR is None. If they need to have some privileges, like being a user with certain access, then Low. If they need admin rights, then High. Since this is a use-after-free in the kernel, the attacker would need to have the ability to trigger the code that leads to the vulnerability. If the code is part of a driver that's accessible via a device, maybe the attacker can do it with normal user privileges. So PR might be Low (L). But I'm not sure. Maybe I should go with High (H) because kernel vulnerabilities often require elevated privileges. Hmm. I think I need to make a decision here. Let's say PR is High (H) because the attacker needs to have the ability to execute code in the kernel, which typically requires root. But maybe in this case, since it's a use-after-free, the attacker can exploit it with lower privileges. I'm a bit confused. Let me check the CVSS guide. The PR metric is defined as: None (N) if no privileges are required, Low (L) if the attacker needs to have some level of access (like a normal user), and High (H) if the attacker needs administrative privileges. Since this is a kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need to have the ability to execute code in the kernel, which typically requires root. So PR is High (H). But maybe in some cases, if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that's accessible via a device, the attacker can exploit it with lower privileges. However, without more information, I think the safest assumption is that PR is High (H).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The UI metric is whether user interaction is required. For a use-after-free in the kernel, the attacker would need to trigger the vulnerability through some code execution. If the vulnerability can be exploited without user interaction, like through a malicious application, then UI is None (N). If the attacker needs the user to interact (like click a link), then Required (R). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, the attacker would need to run code that triggers the use-after-free. This could be done through a local exploit, which doesn't require user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The Scope metric is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). Since this is a vulnerability in the kernel, and the exploit would affect the kernel itself, the scope is Unchanged (U). So S: U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): These are the impact metrics. The vulnerability is a use-after-free, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. If an attacker can exploit this, they could gain control of the system, leading to a complete compromise. Therefore, all three impact metrics (C, I, A) would be High (H). Because the attacker can read, modify, or disrupt the system's availability.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: High (H)\nPR: High (H)\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: High (H)\nI: High (H)\nA: High (H)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about AV. Let me recheck. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel. If the attacker can exploit it locally, then AV is Local (L). But if the kernel module is part of a device that's accessible over the network, maybe AV is Network (N). However, the description doesn't mention network access. The vulnerability is in the DRM code, which is part of the kernel. Exploiting it would require local access, like a local user with the ability to trigger the code. So AV is Local (L). That seems right.\n\nAnother point: the PR metric. If the attacker needs to have local access, which might require some privileges, but not necessarily admin. For example, if the attacker is a regular user who can run a program that triggers the vulnerability, then PR would be Low (L). But if the attacker needs to have root privileges to run the code, then PR is High (H). However, in a typical scenario, a local user can run code without needing root. So maybe PR is Low (L). Wait, but the vulnerability is in the kernel. To trigger a use-after-free in the kernel, the attacker would need to have the ability to execute code that leads to the vulnerability. If the code is part of a driver that's accessible via a device, maybe the attacker can do it with normal user privileges. So PR would be Low (L). But I'm not sure. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability.

Improper rendering of certain file types lead to cross-site scripting.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. The CVE is about a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in GitLab CE/EE. The description says that improper rendering of certain file types leads to XSS. \n\nFirst, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is due to improper rendering of files, which could be triggered via a web request. Since XSS typically requires an attacker to get a user to visit a malicious link, the attack vector is likely Network (N). Because the attacker doesn't need physical access or adjacent network access; it's over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): XSS vulnerabilities often require the attacker to craft a specific payload that gets executed in the user's browser. However, if the vulnerability is straightforward, like a reflected XSS without needing complex conditions, then AC is Low (L). But if it requires specific conditions, maybe High. The description says \"improper rendering of certain file types\" which might imply that the attacker needs to create a file that triggers the XSS. But since it's a common XSS scenario, I think AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): For XSS, the attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the system. The user's browser is the target, so the attacker just needs to trick the user into visiting a malicious link. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): XSS usually requires the user to interact, like clicking a link or visiting a page. So UI is Required (R). However, if the vulnerability is in a part of the application that's automatically rendered without user interaction, maybe it's not required. But the description doesn't specify that. The standard for XSS is that user interaction is required, so UI is R.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component that's being attacked. Since it's a web application vulnerability, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed, but here it's within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): XSS can lead to data exfiltration (C: High), tampering with data (I: High), or causing the application to behave incorrectly (A: High). However, the actual impact depends on the exploit. For XSS, the primary impact is on confidentiality and integrity, but availability might not be directly affected unless the XSS causes a denial of service. The description doesn't mention availability, so maybe A is None. But the standard for XSS is that it can affect confidentiality and integrity, so C and I are High, and A is None.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N\nAC: L\nPR: N\nUI: R\nS: U\nC: H\nI: H\nA: N\n\nWait, but I need to check if the UI is required. If the XSS is stored, maybe the user doesn't need to interact, but the description says \"improper rendering of certain file types lead to cross-site scripting.\" If the file is uploaded and then viewed by another user, that might require user interaction. But if it's a reflected XSS, the user has to click a link. The description isn't specific, but the standard for XSS is that UI is Required. So UI: R.\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. But wait, the availability is None here. Let me confirm. The vulnerability is XSS, which typically doesn't affect availability. So A is N.

Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 135 and Thunderbird < 135.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is about memory safety bugs in Firefox 134 and Thunderbird 134. The description mentions that some bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and could be exploited to run arbitrary code if enough effort was applied. The affected versions are those before 135.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in a web browser, which is typically accessible over a network. Since the user can be tricked into visiting a malicious website, the attack vector is likely Network (N). If it required local access or physical access, that would be different, but here it's about remote exploitation through the browser.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says \"with enough effort some of these could have been exploited.\" That suggests that the attack might not be straightforward. However, memory corruption vulnerabilities often have a low attack complexity if they can be triggered via a crafted input. But the mention of \"enough effort\" might imply that it's not trivial. Wait, but in CVSS, if the attack requires some skill but not necessarily complex steps, it's still considered Low. However, if it's more complex, like needing specific conditions, it's High. The description says \"with enough effort,\" which might lean towards Low because it's possible with some work, not necessarily high complexity. Hmm, but I need to be careful here. Maybe the fact that it's a memory corruption bug that can be exploited to run arbitrary code is a common scenario, which is usually considered Low AC. So I'll go with Low (L) for AC.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The vulnerability is in the browser, which is a user application. If an attacker can exploit this, they might not need any special privileges. For example, if a user visits a malicious site, the exploit would run in the context of the user, so no elevated privileges are needed. Therefore, PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The user would need to interact with the malicious content, like clicking a link or visiting a website. So User Interaction is Required (R). If the exploit could be triggered without user action, like through a network service, UI would be None. But here, the user has to engage with the malicious input, so R is correct.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability is in the browser itself, which is part of the same component. Exploiting it doesn't change the scope beyond the existing application. So Scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component or system, it would be Changed, but here it's within the same application.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution, which can lead to complete compromise of the system. Therefore, all three impacts are High (H). If the exploit could only read data, that would be Confidentiality, but since it's arbitrary code execution, it can affect all three aspects: steal data (C), modify data (I), and disrupt services (A). So C, I, A are all H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: H (High)\n\nThe vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n\nWait, but I need to check if UI is Required. The user has to interact, like visiting a malicious site. So yes, UI is R. But sometimes, if the attack is via a network without user interaction, like a buffer overflow in a service, UI is N. But in this case, the browser requires user interaction to load the malicious content. So UI is R. That seems right.\n\nAnother point: the attack vector is Network because the exploit is delivered over the network (e.g., via a website). So AV is N.

First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in File Station 5. A remote attacker who gains a user account can exploit this to launch a DoS attack. The fix is in version 5.5.6.4847 and later.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions a remote attacker, so the attack can be done over the network. That points to AV:N (Network).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which might be exploitable with low complexity. Since it's a straightforward issue that doesn't require complex steps, I'll go with AC:L (Low).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker needs a user account to exploit this. That's not high privilege, but not none either. However, the description says \"gains a user account,\" which implies that the attacker already has some level of access. But in terms of the vulnerability itself, does it require any privileges beyond that? The vulnerability might be exploitable with existing user privileges. Since the attacker needs a user account, which is a form of low privilege, maybe PR:L. Wait, but if the attacker can exploit it with just a user account, which is a low privilege, then PR would be Low. However, if the vulnerability doesn't require any additional privileges beyond having the account, maybe PR:N? Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the application, and if the attacker has a user account, they can exploit it. So the attacker needs to have a user account, which is a form of privilege. But the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker already has a user account, then the PR would be Low, because they need low-level privileges. But if the vulnerability can be exploited without any privileges, then PR:N. However, the description says \"gains a user account,\" which suggests that the attacker must have that privilege. So maybe PR:L. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check some examples. For example, if a vulnerability requires the attacker to have a user account, that's considered Low privilege. So PR:L.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description doesn't mention any need for user interaction. The attacker can exploit it remotely once they have the account. So UI:N (None).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the application, and the attack affects the same component. So the scope is unchanged. S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability leads to a DoS attack, which doesn't impact confidentiality. So C:N.\n\nIntegrity (I): Similarly, a DoS attack doesn't affect integrity. So I:N.\n\nAvailability (A): The DoS attack would impact availability, so A:H (High).\n\nWait, but the DoS is a high impact on availability. So A:H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV:N, AC:L, PR:L, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H.\n\nWait, but earlier I was confused about PR. Let me recheck. The attacker needs a user account. If the user account is considered a low privilege, then PR:L. But if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing any additional privileges beyond having the account, then maybe PR:N? For example, if the vulnerability is in a part of the system that's accessible with a user account, then the attacker doesn't need to escalate privileges. So the PR would be Low because they need a user account, which is a low-level privilege. But according to CVSS guidelines, PR:N is when no privileges are required. If the attacker needs to have a user account, that's a requirement, so PR:L. So I think PR:L is correct here.\n\nSo the final vector would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.0, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in vBulletin versions where attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code by exploiting Template Conditionals in the template engine. They use alternative PHP function syntax like var_dump(\"test\") to bypass security checks. This was exploited in the wild in May 2025.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the attack is done by crafting template code, which is part of the application's processing. Since it's a web application, and the attack is likely through the network (like HTTP requests), AV should be Network (N). If it required physical access or local privileges, it would be different, but here it's a remote exploit.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary PHP code with a specific syntax. If the attacker just needs to send a crafted request without complex steps, AC is Low (L). If it required multiple steps or specific conditions, it would be High. Since the exploit is straightforward once the template is crafted, I think AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) refers to the level of access the attacker needs. The description doesn't mention needing any user credentials or elevated privileges. The attack is possible through the template engine, which might be accessible without authentication. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is whether the user needs to interact for the attack to succeed. If the exploit requires the user to click a link or perform an action, UI is Required (R). However, if the attack can be done remotely without user interaction, like a server-side vulnerability, UI is None (N). Since the exploit is through the template engine, which is part of the server processing, I think UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) determines if the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). Since the vulnerability is in the vBulletin application itself, and the attack is within the same application's scope, S is Unchanged (U). If it affected a different component, like a database, it would be Changed, but here it's the same.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution, which can lead to full control of the server. This would allow an attacker to access, modify, or disrupt the system. So all three impact metrics (C, I, A) are High (H). Even if the exploit doesn't directly affect availability, the potential for arbitrary code execution implies all three are at risk.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:H.

An attacker can exploit this by sending multiple requests to an attacker-controlled server that hangs, causing the application to block and become unresponsive to other requests.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the typeahead endpoint of h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0. The issue is that the endpoint sends a HEAD request to check if a resource exists but doesn't set a timeout. An attacker can exploit this by sending multiple requests to a server that's hanging, making the application unresponsive.\n\nSo, the main points here are that the attack is a denial of service (DoS) caused by the lack of a timeout on the HEAD request. The attacker can send requests to a server that's hanging, which blocks the application. Let's break down each metric step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in an endpoint that's accessible over the network. Since the attacker can send requests to the server from anywhere on the network, AV should be Network (N). If it required local access or physical access, it would be different, but here it's a remote DoS.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is about how complex the attack is. The description says the attacker can exploit this by sending multiple requests. It doesn't mention any specific complexity, like needing to bypass security measures or specific configurations. So, it's likely Low (L) because the attack is straightforward—just sending requests to a server that's hanging.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) refers to the level of access the attacker needs. The vulnerability is in an endpoint that's presumably accessible without authentication. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges; they just need to send requests. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is whether the user needs to interact for the attack to succeed. The description doesn't mention any user interaction required. The attacker can exploit it remotely without any user action, so UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). Since the vulnerability is in the application itself and the attack affects the application's availability, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability was in a different component, like a library, it might be Changed, but here it's the same application.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. The vulnerability leads to a denial of service, so Availability is High (H). There's no mention of data being accessed or modified, so Confidentiality and Integrity are None (N). The attack doesn't leak data or alter it, just makes the service unavailable.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:N, I:N, A:H. The vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Wait, but the original problem says the answer should have C, I, A as H, H, H? Wait, no. Let me check again. The CVE description says it's a denial of service, so Availability (A) is High. But the other impact metrics (Confidentiality and Integrity) are not affected. So C and I are N. So the correct values are C:N, I:N, A:H. Therefore, the vector string should be AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. But wait, the example given in the problem had C:H, I:H, A:H. But that's just an example. In this case, the vulnerability only affects availability. So the answer should have C:N, I:N, A:H. Let me confirm once more. The attack causes the application to become unresponsive, which is a DoS, so A is H. There's no loss of confidentiality or integrity. So yes, C and I are N.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Master Addons plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, allowing authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts. These scripts execute when a user accesses the injected page.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means the payload is stored on the server and executed when a user accesses the page. Since it's stored, the attack doesn't require network access from the attacker's side. However, the user needs to access the page where the script is stored. But in terms of AV, the attack vector is typically considered as Network (N) because the initial injection might be done via a web request, even if it's stored. Wait, but stored XSS is usually considered as requiring the user to access the page, which is a local action. Hmm, but the initial injection is done via a network request. So maybe AV is Network (N) because the attacker sends the payload over the network to the server, which stores it. Then, when a user visits the page, the script is executed. So AV is Network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization. If the attacker can inject the script by sending a request with the 'id' parameter, that's a low complexity. The attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps; just sending a crafted request with the malicious script. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The description says authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above. Contributor is a role in WordPress that allows editing posts but not publishing. So the attacker needs to be authenticated with at least Contributor access. That means the attacker needs some level of privilege, but not high. So PR is Low (L) because it's not requiring administrative privileges, just a lower level. Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. So PR would be Low (L) because it's not requiring high privileges, just a lower level. Alternatively, if the attacker needs to be authenticated, maybe that's considered as requiring some privilege, so PR is Low. But if the system allows unauthenticated users to inject, then PR would be None. But here, the attacker must be authenticated. So PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Stored XSS doesn't require user interaction. The user doesn't need to click on a link or interact with the script; it's executed when they access the page. However, the user must access the page where the script is stored. But in terms of UI, the user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. Wait, no. The user interaction is whether the user needs to take an action for the attack to occur. In stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact beyond visiting the page. So UI is None (N) because the user doesn't need to interact with the malicious script. Wait, but the user has to access the page. However, in CVSS, UI is about whether the user needs to interact with the attack vector. For example, if the attack requires the user to click a link, that's Required (R). But in stored XSS, the user just visits the page, which is a normal action. So UI is None (N) because the user doesn't need to interact with the attack vector beyond their normal use. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component where the attack is initiated. Since the plugin is part of WordPress, and the attack is within the same application, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component or system, it would be Changed (C). Here, it's within the same application, so S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C): The XSS allows the attacker to inject scripts that can steal data from the user's session. For example, stealing cookies, which could lead to unauthorized access. So the confidentiality impact is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The attacker can inject scripts that modify the content of the page, which could alter data or inject malicious content. So the integrity impact is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The XSS might not directly affect availability, but if the script causes the page to crash or consume resources, it could. However, the primary impact here is on confidentiality and integrity. So Availability is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but earlier I thought PR was Low (L) because the attacker needs Contributor access. But the options for PR are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. So PR is Low (L) because it's not requiring high privileges. So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

To properly release it, we should call r8712_free_io_queue() in r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit(). Besides, in r871xu_dev_remove(), r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() will be called by r871x_dev_unload() under condition `padapter->bup` and r8712_free_io_queue() is called by r8712_free_drv_sw(). However, r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() does not rely on `padapter->bup` and calling r8712_free_io_queue() in r8712_free_drv_sw() is negative for better understading the code. So I move r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() into r871xu_dev_remove(), and remove r8712_free_io_queue() from r8712_free_drv_sw().\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to analyze the CVE description and calculate the CVSS v3.1 base score. First, I need to understand the vulnerability described.\n\nThe CVE is about a memory leak in the Linux kernel's rtl8712 driver. The issue is that when r8712_init_drv_sw() fails, the memory allocated by r8712_alloc_io_queue() isn't released because r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() isn't called. The fix involves moving the deinit call to r871xu_dev_remove() and removing the free call from another function.\n\nNow, for CVSS v3.1, the base metrics are AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A. Let's go through each one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel driver. Since it's a memory leak, it's probably not exploitable over the network. But wait, the driver is part of the kernel, which runs on the system. So the attack vector would be Local (L) because it's a local issue, not requiring network access. Unless there's a way to trigger this from outside, but the description doesn't mention that. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Memory leaks can sometimes be exploited with low complexity if the attacker can trigger the allocation and then cause the system to crash or leak data. But in this case, the memory isn't being accessed or used in a way that allows exploitation. It's just a leak. So maybe AC is High (H) because the attacker would need to find a way to exploit the leak, which might not be straightforward. Wait, but if the memory leak leads to a denial of service, maybe that's easier. Hmm. But the vulnerability itself is a memory leak, which might not directly lead to a security impact unless it's used in a specific way. Maybe AC is Low (L) if the attacker can exploit it with minimal steps. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. Since the vulnerability is a memory leak, but the actual exploit would require the attacker to have some way to trigger the allocation and then cause the system to use that memory. However, the description doesn't mention any way to exploit this. So maybe the AC is High because the attacker would need to find a way to exploit the leak, which isn't straightforward. But I'm not certain. Maybe I should check standard CVSS examples. For example, a memory leak that doesn't allow for exploitation might have AC as High. But if the leak leads to a DoS, maybe AC is Low. But the problem here is that the vulnerability is a memory leak, but the actual impact isn't specified. The description doesn't mention confidentiality, integrity, or availability being affected. Wait, the original CVE might have been fixed, but the description is about the fix. The original vulnerability might have been a memory leak that could lead to a DoS if the system runs out of memory. But the description doesn't state that. So maybe the impact metrics are N for C, I, A. But the user is asking for the base score based on the description provided. The description is about the fix, not the vulnerability itself. Wait, the CVE description is about the vulnerability that was resolved. The original vulnerability was a potential memory leak. So the vulnerability is a memory leak. But how does that translate to CVSS metrics?\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): A memory leak might not directly impact confidentiality or integrity unless it's used to leak data. But if the memory isn't being accessed, maybe the impact is None. However, if the memory leak leads to a denial of service (e.g., the system runs out of memory), then Availability would be High. But the description doesn't mention that. The fix is about ensuring the memory is freed, which would prevent a DoS. So the original vulnerability might have allowed for a DoS if the memory wasn't freed. But the description doesn't explicitly say that. So maybe the impact is None for all three. But that's a bit tricky. Alternatively, if the memory leak could be exploited to cause a DoS, then A would be High. But without explicit mention, it's hard to say. However, in CVSS, if the vulnerability can be exploited to cause a DoS, then A is High. But if the vulnerability is just a memory leak without any exploitation path, then maybe the impact is None. But I need to make an educated guess here.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, an attacker would need to have local privileges to exploit it. So PR is High (H) because the attacker would need to have access to the system to trigger the memory leak. Wait, but if the memory leak is in a driver that's part of the kernel, maybe the attacker doesn't need any privileges. Wait, no. The driver is part of the kernel, so any code running in the kernel would have high privileges. But the vulnerability is a memory leak that occurs during driver initialization. To trigger this, the attacker would need to have the ability to load or interact with the driver, which might require root privileges. So PR is High (H). But if the driver is part of the kernel, maybe the attacker doesn't need any privileges because the driver is already loaded. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the driver's initialization code. If the driver is part of the kernel, then the code is already running with kernel privileges. So the attacker would need to have some way to trigger the failure in r8712_init_drv_sw(), which might require having the ability to interact with the driver. But without knowing the exact scenario, it's hard. However, in general, kernel vulnerabilities often require local access, so PR is High (H).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability doesn't require user interaction. It's a local issue that occurs during driver initialization. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the same component. So the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L)\nAC: High (H) – because the attacker needs to find a way to exploit the memory leak, which might not be straightforward.\nPR: High (H) – requires local access to the system.\nUI: None (N)\nS: Unchanged (U)\nC: None (N) – no confidentiality impact.\nI: None (N) – no integrity impact.\nA: None (N) – no availability impact unless the memory leak leads to a DoS, but the description doesn't mention that.\n\nWait, but if the memory leak could lead to a DoS, then A would be High. However, the description doesn't state that. The fix is about preventing the memory leak, which might prevent a DoS. So the original vulnerability might have allowed for a DoS if the memory wasn't freed. But without explicit mention, it's safer to assume that the impact is None. However, in some cases, a memory leak can be considered as a DoS if it leads to resource exhaustion. But again, the description doesn't specify that. So maybe A is None.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check standard CVSS examples. For example, a memory leak that doesn't allow for exploitation would have C, I, A as None. If it can be exploited to cause a DoS, then A is High. But without explicit information, it's safer to assume None.\n\nSo the final metrics would be:\n\nAV: L\nAC: H\nPR: H\nUI: N\nS: U\nC: N\nI: N\nA: N\n\nBut wait, the CVSS base score calculation would then be based on these. However, the user is asking for the vector string, not the actual score. So the vector would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N\n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me recheck each metric.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is local. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H) because the attacker needs to find a way to exploit the memory leak, which might not be straightforward.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): High (H) because the attacker needs local access to the system.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): None (N) because no user interaction is needed.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability is in the same component.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N) because the memory leak doesn't expose data.\n\nIntegrity (I): None (N) because the memory leak doesn't corrupt data.\n\nAvailability (A): None (N) because the memory leak doesn't directly impact availability unless it's a DoS, which isn't mentioned.\n\nSo the vector string would be as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 5.5, "success": true}

Certain error messages could allow Cross-Site Scripting attacks (XSS). for AppSec.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The issue is in GitLab EE/CE related to AppSec, affecting certain versions. The problem is that certain error messages could allow Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\nSo, the main vulnerability here is XSS. Let me recall the CVSS metrics. The base metrics include Attack Vector (AV), Attack Complexity (AC), Privileges Required (PR), User Interaction (UI), Scope (S), Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). \n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). XSS vulnerabilities typically require the attacker to get the victim to visit a malicious link. Since this is a web application vulnerability, the attack vector is likely Network (N) because it can be exploited over the network without needing physical access or adjacent systems.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. XSS usually doesn't require complex steps. If the error message is rendered in a way that allows script execution, the attacker just needs to inject the script into the error message. So AC is probably Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) – for XSS, the attacker doesn't need any special privileges. The user's browser is the one executing the script, so PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) – XSS often requires the user to interact, like clicking a link or visiting a page. Since the error message is part of the application's response, the user would need to be tricked into viewing it. So UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S) – If the vulnerability affects the same component that's being accessed, the scope is Unchanged (U). If it's a different component, it's Changed (C). Here, the XSS is in the AppSec part of GitLab, so the scope is likely Unchanged.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) – XSS can lead to data theft (C: High), data modification (I: High), or denial of service (A: High). But wait, the description says \"certain error messages could allow XSS attacks.\" So the primary impact here is on integrity and confidentiality. However, availability might not be directly affected unless the XSS causes a DoS. Since the description doesn't mention availability, maybe A is None. But I need to check. XSS can steal session cookies, leading to confidentiality issues (C: H), and inject malicious scripts that alter content (I: H). Availability might not be impacted here, so A is N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but I need to confirm the UI. If the user interaction is required, like the user has to click on a link or visit a page, then UI is R. But if the error message is automatically shown when the user accesses a certain page, maybe the user interaction isn't required. Hmm. The description says \"certain error messages could allow XSS attacks.\" So the error message is part of the application's response. If the user is tricked into visiting a page that triggers the error message, then the user interaction is required.

In affected versions a user can inject commands via the nmap_cmd parameters. This issue has been addressed in commit `c28e5c8d` and is expected in the next versioned release. Users are advised to filter user input and monitor the project for a new release.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in reNgine, an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications. The issue is that a user can inject commands via the nmap_cmd parameters. The fix is in a specific commit and will be in the next release. Users are advised to filter input and monitor for updates.\n\nSo, the main points here are that the vulnerability allows command injection through a parameter. Let's break down each metric step by step.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description mentions that the user can inject commands via the nmap_cmd parameters. Since this is a web application, and the parameter is likely passed through a network request (like HTTP), the attack vector is probably Network (N). Unless there's a specific reason to think it's local or adjacent, but the mention of a web app suggests network access.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a command injection, which typically requires some level of input manipulation. However, if the attack can be done with simple input without complex steps, then AC is Low (L). If it requires specific conditions or complex steps, it's High. Since the user can inject commands directly via the parameter, it's likely Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user is able to inject commands. If the user doesn't need any special privileges beyond what a normal user has, then PR is None (N). If the attacker needs elevated privileges, it would be High or Low. But since it's a parameter injection, probably no special privileges are needed. So PR is N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The description says the user can inject commands. If the attack requires the user to interact (like clicking a link or providing input), then UI is Required (R). But if it's an automated attack that doesn't need user interaction, it's None. However, the vulnerability is in the framework, so maybe the user (attacker) needs to provide the malicious input. But the UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be done without any user interaction (like a remote exploit), then UI is N. But if the user has to interact with the application (e.g., submit a form), then it's R. The description says \"a user can inject commands\", which might imply that the user (attacker) is the one initiating the request. So maybe UI is None if it's a remote exploit, but if the user has to interact with the application (like visiting a URL), then it's Required. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The UI metric in CVSS v3.1 refers to whether the attack requires the victim to interact with the application. If the attack is initiated by the attacker without any user action (like a remote code execution), then UI is N. If the attack requires the user to perform an action (like clicking a link), then UI is R. Since the vulnerability is in the framework, and the user (attacker) is injecting commands, it's possible that the attack doesn't require user interaction from the victim. So UI is N.\n\nScope (S): This is about whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). If the vulnerability is in the web application and affects the same scope, then S is U. If it's in a different component, like a library, then C. But the description says it's in reNgine, which is the application itself. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): These are the impact metrics. The vulnerability allows command injection, which can lead to unauthorized access (C), data modification (I), or denial of service (A). Since command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, which could lead to all three impacts. However, the description doesn't specify which ones are affected. But typically, command injection can lead to high impact on all three. So C, I, A would be High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: H (High)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 1.0, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Taxonomy Chain Menu plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the pn_chain_menu shortcode. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject scripts, which then execute when users access the affected pages.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in a WordPress plugin, and since it's a stored XSS, the attack would typically be delivered through the web application. However, stored XSS usually requires the attacker to have some way to inject the script into the application, which in this case is done via the plugin's shortcode. Since the attacker is authenticated, but the initial injection is through the web interface, the attack vector is likely Network (N) because it's accessible over the network. Even though the attacker needs to be authenticated, the initial vector is still through the web, so AV=N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description says the attacker needs to inject arbitrary scripts, but since it's stored XSS, the complexity might be low. The attacker just needs to find a way to inject the script into the system, which in this case is via the shortcode. Since there's no mention of needing complex steps or specific conditions, AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs contributor-level access or higher. Contributor access in WordPress allows users to create and edit posts, but not necessarily to modify plugins or core files. However, the vulnerability is in the plugin's shortcode, so the attacker can inject the script into their own content, which they can control. Since they need to be authenticated, but the privilege level is contributor, which is a low level of privilege (as opposed to admin), PR is Low (L). Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a requirement, but the privilege level is contributor. However, in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. But the options for PR are None, Low, High. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, but the privilege level is contributor, which is a low level of privilege, then PR would be Low (L). However, if the attacker doesn't need any privileges, it's N. But here, the attacker does need to be authenticated, so PR is Low (L). Wait, but the options for PR are None (N), Low (L), High (H). So if the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. But in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges required. For example, if the attacker needs admin rights, that's High. If they need user-level access, that's Low. Since contributor is a lower privilege than admin, but higher than none, so PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is stored, meaning the attacker injects the script into the system, and when a user accesses the page, the script executes. However, the user interaction here is whether the user needs to interact with the attack. Since it's stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact beyond accessing the page. However, the attacker might need the user to view the page. But in CVSS, UI is about whether user interaction is required for the attack to succeed. For stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact beyond accessing the page, so UI is None (N). Wait, but sometimes stored XSS requires the user to view the page, which is a form of interaction. However, in CVSS, UI is considered as whether the user needs to be tricked into interacting with the attack. For example, if the attack requires the user to click a link, that's Required (R). But in stored XSS, the user just needs to view the page, which is not considered user interaction in the CVSS context. Therefore, UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability is in the plugin, which is part of the WordPress application. The attack affects the same component (the web application), so the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component (like a database), it would be Changed (C). Here, the scope remains within the application, so S=U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability is XSS, which can lead to stealing session cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the site. So, the impact on confidentiality is High (H) because an attacker can steal sensitive information. Integrity is also High (H) because the attacker can inject scripts that alter the content. Availability might be Low (L) if the attack causes the site to be unavailable, but in this case, the XSS is more about data manipulation rather than denial of service. However, the description doesn't mention availability impact, so maybe A=N. Wait, but the CVSS base metrics for impact are based on the potential impact. For XSS, the primary impacts are confidentiality and integrity. Availability is not typically affected unless the attack causes the system to crash or become unavailable. Since the description doesn't mention availability, A=N. However, sometimes stored XSS can be used to perform actions on behalf of the user, which could affect availability if the attacker uses the XSS to send a lot of requests. But without specific mention, it's safer to assume A=N. However, the CVSS impact calculation might require considering the maximum of the three. But the user is to determine the values based on the description. The description says the attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that execute when a user accesses the page. This can lead to stealing data (C=H), altering content (I=H), but not necessarily affecting availability. So A=N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, constructing the vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `informacao_adicional.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `descricao` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `informacao_adicional.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed, the malicious payload is executed in the victim's browser, potentially compromising the user's data and system. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.6 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored XSS in the WeGIA application's informacao_adicional.php endpoint. The attacker can inject malicious scripts into the 'descricao' parameter, which are stored on the server and executed when the page is accessed. The app doesn't validate or sanitize user inputs properly.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is in a web application and the attack is via a parameter in a web request, the attack vector is Network (N). That's because the attacker doesn't need physical access or adjacent network; they can exploit it over the internet.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The description says the vulnerability is due to improper input validation. Exploiting this would likely require crafting a specific payload, but since it's a stored XSS, the complexity is low. The attacker just needs to inject the script into the parameter, which is straightforward. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is about what the attacker needs to have. Since the vulnerability is in a web form that's accessible to any user (assuming the endpoint is public), the attacker doesn't need any special privileges. They can inject the script without authentication. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI) refers to whether the user needs to interact for the attack to succeed. In a stored XSS, the user doesn't need to do anything; the malicious script is executed automatically when they access the page. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component or a different one. Since the vulnerability is in the web application itself and the impact is on the same component (the user's browser when they access the page), the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, but maybe I should think again. The vulnerability is in the application, but the impact is on the user's browser. However, according to CVSS, if the vulnerability affects the same component, it's unchanged. If it affects a different component (like a different system), it's changed. Here, the attack is on the same application, so S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. The vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser. This can lead to stealing session cookies, redirecting users, or other malicious actions. So, the attacker can access confidential data (C: High), modify data (I: High), and potentially cause denial of service if the script is malicious (A: High). But wait, the description doesn't mention availability impact. However, XSS can lead to DoS if the script is designed to consume resources. But the primary impact here is on confidentiality and integrity. The availability might be low or none. Let me check the standard for XSS. Typically, XSS vulnerabilities are rated with High impact on confidentiality and integrity, and low or none on availability. Since the description doesn't mention availability issues, maybe A is None (N). But I need to be careful. The CVSS guidelines say that if the vulnerability can be used to cause a denial of service, then A is High. If not, then it's Low or None. Since the vulnerability is stored XSS, the attacker can inject a script that might cause the browser to crash or consume resources, but that's not explicitly stated. However, the primary impact is on confidentiality and integrity. So I'll go with C: High, I: High, A: None. Wait, but some sources might say that stored XSS can lead to availability issues if the script is a loop or something. But without explicit mention, it's safer to assume A is None. Alternatively, maybe the availability is Low. Hmm. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 guidelines. The impact metrics are based on the potential impact of the vulnerability. For XSS, the main impacts are confidentiality and integrity. Availability is usually not affected unless the attack specifically targets it. So I think A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but I need to confirm the availability. If the attacker can cause the browser to crash, that's availability. But the description doesn't mention that. So I think A is N. However, some might argue that the script could be designed to cause a DoS, but without explicit info, it's safer to go with N. So the final vector is as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 3.6999999999999993, "success": true}

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.8.9, 1.9.6, 2.0.5, and 2.1.2, which fix the issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the Apache ORC C++ library's LZO decompression logic. The issue arises when processing specially crafted malformed ORC files. The decompressor allocates a 250-byte buffer but tries to copy 295 bytes into it, leading to memory corruption. The affected versions are listed, and the fix is to upgrade to specific versions.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the decompression logic, which is part of processing files. Since ORC files are typically processed by applications that read them from a network or a file system, but the exploit would require the application to process a malicious file. However, the attack vector here is likely Network (N) because the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a malicious file over the network. Alternatively, if the application is running on the same system and the file is read from the local file system, it might be Local (L). But since ORC files are often used in data processing systems that might receive files from untrusted sources over the network, I think AV is Network (N). But I need to be careful here. If the application is processing a file that's uploaded or received via a network service, then AV is N. If it's a local file that the user opens, then AV is L. The description doesn't specify, but since it's a decompression library, it's possible that the application using this library could be a server that receives ORC files over the network. So I'll go with AV:N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a buffer overflow, which typically requires specific conditions to be exploited. However, the description says that specially crafted malformed ORC files can cause the issue. The exploit would require the attacker to create a specific file that triggers the overflow. Since the attacker needs to craft the input, but the attack is straightforward once the file is processed, the complexity is Low (L). So AC:L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the decompression logic. If the application is processing the ORC file without requiring any user privileges, then the attacker doesn't need any privileges. For example, if the application is a server that processes files from clients, then the attacker might not need any privileges. However, if the application is a local tool that requires user interaction, then PR might be Low or None. The description doesn't mention any specific privilege requirements. Since the decompression is part of the library, and the application using it might not require elevated privileges, I think PR is None (N). The attacker doesn't need any special privileges to exploit this, just to get the malicious file processed.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered by processing a malicious file. If the user has to open the file, then UI:R. But if the application is processing the file automatically without user interaction, like a server receiving a file, then UI:N. The description says \"specially crafted malformed ORC files can cause the decompressor...\" which implies that the user or application must process the file. If the application is a server that automatically processes incoming files, then UI:N. However, if the user has to open the file, then UI:R. The description doesn't specify, but since it's a library, the application using it might be a server or a tool that processes files. If the user is required to open the file, then UI:R. But if the application is processing the file without user interaction, then UI:N. This is a bit ambiguous. However, in many cases, buffer overflows in libraries that process files can be exploited without user interaction if the application is processing the file automatically. But if the user has to open the file, then UI:R. Since the CVE description doesn't specify, but the example in the problem might have similar cases. For example, if the vulnerability is in a server component, UI:N. If it's in a client application, UI:R. Since ORC is a data format used in data processing, it's possible that the application is a server or a tool that processes files, so UI:N. But I'm not 100% sure. However, the example given in the problem's final line has UI:N, so maybe that's a clue. But I need to make a best guess here. Let's say UI:N because the attack can be triggered by the application processing the file without user interaction.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the ORC library, which is part of the application. If the vulnerability affects the same component (the library) that's being used, then the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component, then it's Changed (C). Since the buffer overflow is in the library itself, and the exploit would affect the same component, S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability is a buffer overflow leading to memory corruption. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, which would allow the attacker to read or write data (C:H), modify data (I:H), or cause the application to crash (A:H). So all three are High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: H (High)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

This lingering reference comes from a secpath (which holds a ref on the xfrm_state), which is still attached to an skb. This skb is not leaked, it ends up on sk_receive_queue and then gets defer-free'd by skb_attempt_defer_free. The problem happens when we defer freeing an skb (push it on one CPU's defer_list), and don't flush that list before the netns is deleted. In that case, we still have a reference on the xfrm_state that we don't expect at this point. We already drop the skb's dst in the TCP receive path when it's no longer needed, so let's also drop the secpath. At this point, tcp_filter has already called into the LSM hooks that may require the secpath, so it should not be needed anymore. However, in some of those places, the MPTCP extension has just been attached to the skb, so we cannot simply drop all extensions.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to the TCP protocol handling. The issue arises when a secpath (security path) isn't properly dropped when a network namespace (netns) is deleted, leading to a lingering reference on an xfrm_state. This can cause a warning in xfrm6_tunnel_net_exit during certain tests involving netns and ipcomp6.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is related to the TCP protocol in the Linux kernel. Since it's a kernel-level issue, it's likely exploitable over the network. The description mentions that the problem occurs during tests involving network namespaces and TCP, which are network-related. So AV is probably Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability seems to require specific conditions to trigger, like creating and deleting netns, running TCP tests with ipcomp6. This might not be straightforward, but the exploit might not require complex steps. However, the description doesn't mention any specific exploit code or ease of exploitation. Since it's a kernel issue, maybe AC is Low (L) because it's a straightforward issue once the conditions are met.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the kernel, so an attacker would need elevated privileges to exploit it. However, the description doesn't specify if user-level access is needed. Wait, the problem occurs when netns are deleted, which might be part of system administration tasks. But if an attacker can trigger this scenario, maybe they need root or high privileges. However, the vulnerability might be exploitable without user interaction, but the PR metric is about the level of privileges required. Since it's a kernel vulnerability, maybe PR is High (H) because you need to have the ability to manipulate network namespaces and TCP, which typically requires administrative privileges. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the vulnerability can be triggered by a local user without needing special privileges, maybe PR is Low or None. Wait, the problem is in the kernel, so an attacker would need to have access to the system to exploit it. If it's a local vulnerability, then PR might be None (N) if no privileges are needed. But I'm confused here. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the kernel, so to exploit it, an attacker would need to have the ability to create and manipulate network namespaces, which usually requires root or administrative privileges. Therefore, PR is High (H). But maybe the vulnerability is exploitable by a local user without needing elevated privileges. Hmm. The description says that the problem is hit during tests that involve creating netns, which are typically done by users with root access. So maybe PR is High (H) because the attacker needs to have the ability to create and delete netns, which requires elevated privileges.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is triggered during specific test scenarios. The description mentions that the problem occurs when the netns is deleted, which might be part of a test. If the exploit requires the user to perform certain actions, like running specific tests, then UI might be Required (R). However, if the vulnerability can be triggered automatically without user interaction, then UI is None (N). The description says that the issue is hit while running tests, which implies that user interaction is needed to trigger the scenario. So UI is Required (R). But wait, the vulnerability itself might not require user interaction once the conditions are met. However, the test setup requires user interaction. So maybe UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel's TCP handling) and doesn't change the scope. So S is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability leads to a warning in the kernel, but does it impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability? The problem is a reference leak that could cause a warning, but does it allow data leakage, data modification, or denial of service? The description mentions that the secpath is not dropped, leading to a lingering reference. This might not directly impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability. However, if the warning leads to a crash or instability, that could affect availability. But the description doesn't mention any denial of service or data corruption. The main issue is a warning, which might not be a direct security impact. However, in CVSS, if the vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service, then A would be High. But the description doesn't state that the vulnerability can be exploited to cause a DoS. It's more of a bug that causes a warning, which might not be exploitable. Therefore, maybe C, I, A are None (N). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the vulnerability could be exploited to cause a crash, then A would be High. However, the description doesn't mention that. It's a bug that's fixed by dropping the secpath, which prevents the warning. So maybe the vulnerability doesn't have a direct impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Therefore, C, I, A are None (N).\n\nWait, but the CVSS base score requires that if the vulnerability can be exploited to cause a security impact, then the metric should be set. If the vulnerability is a bug that could lead to a crash (availability), but the description doesn't mention that. It's a warning, which might not be a security issue. However, in some cases, a warning could be a symptom of a more serious issue. But without explicit mention of exploitation leading to data loss, modification, or denial of service, the metrics might be set to None. However, I need to be careful here. If the vulnerability is a DoS, then A is High. If it's a data leak, C is High. If it's data modification, I is High. Since the description doesn't mention any of these, maybe all three are None. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the vulnerability could be exploited to cause a denial of service by triggering the warning repeatedly, leading to system instability. But that's speculative. The description doesn't state that, so I should stick with None for C, I, A.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: H (High)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but if the vulnerability is in the kernel and requires specific conditions, maybe the Attack Vector is Local (L) because it's a local kernel vulnerability. Wait, the problem is related to network namespaces and TCP, which are network-related. However, the exploit would require access to the system, so maybe AV is Local (L) if the attacker is on the same system. But the original description says that the vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which is a local component. However, the attack vector could be Network if the vulnerability can be triggered remotely. But the description doesn't mention remote exploitation. The tests are run locally, so the attack vector is likely Local (L). Hmm, this is a point of confusion. Let me check again.\n\nThe CVE description mentions that the problem is hit during tests that involve creating netns and running TCP tests. This suggests that the vulnerability is a local issue, as the tests are performed on the same system. Therefore, the attack vector is Local (L). However, if the vulnerability can be triggered remotely via TCP, then AV would be Network (N). But the description doesn't mention remote exploitation. It's a kernel-level issue that requires local access to manipulate netns and TCP. Therefore, AV is Local (L).\n\nSo revising:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: H (High)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nBut I'm still not sure about the Attack Vector. If the vulnerability is in the kernel and requires local access, then AV is Local. However, if the vulnerability can be exploited over the network, then AV is Network. The description doesn't mention remote exploitation, so I think AV is Local (L).\n\nBut wait, the problem is in the TCP stack, which is a network protocol. However, the exploit requires creating and deleting netns, which is a local operation. Therefore, AV is Local (L).\n\nSo the metrics would be:\n\nAV: L\nAC: L\nPR: H\nUI: R\nS: U\nC: N\nI: N\nA: N\n\nBut I need to check the CVSS guidelines. For example, if the vulnerability is in a service that can be accessed over the network, AV is Network. But if it's a local kernel issue, AV is Local. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and requires local access to manipulate netns, AV is Local.\n\nNow, the Attack Complexity (AC) is Low if the attack is straightforward. Since the vulnerability requires specific conditions (creating netns, running TCP tests), but once those are met, the exploit is simple. So AC is Low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) is High because the attacker needs to have the ability to create and delete netns, which typically requires root or administrative privileges.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is Required because the test scenario requires user interaction to set up the netns and run the tests.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged because the vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel's TCP handling) and doesn't change the scope.\n\nConfidentiality, Integrity, Availability are None because the vulnerability doesn't directly impact these aspects.

This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the /bigquery API route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28. The main issue is that there's no proper access control, so any logged-in user can create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database, including sensitive data like password hashes and API keys. The route is protected by a config check, but it doesn't verify the user's access level or use access control middleware. The consequences include data extraction, service disruption, credential compromise, and integrity breaches.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics for CVSS v3.1. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in an API route that's accessible over the network. Since it's a web API, the attack can be done remotely without needing physical access or adjacent network. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says any logged-in user can exploit this. It doesn't require complex steps or specific conditions. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user needs to be logged in, but the vulnerability allows any logged-in user. So the attacker needs to have a valid user account, which is a low privilege requirement. However, the PR metric in CVSS v3.1 considers the level of privileges needed. Since the user is already authenticated, but the system doesn't check their access level, maybe it's considered Low (L). Wait, but if the user is already authenticated, does that count as requiring privileges? Hmm. The PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be a user with some privileges (like being logged in), but the system doesn't enforce access control, then maybe PR is Low. Alternatively, if the user is a regular user without elevated privileges, but the system allows them to do something they shouldn't, then PR is Low. So I think PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is exploitable by any logged-in user without needing additional interaction. The user just needs to be logged in and use the API. So UI is None (N), because no user interaction is required beyond the initial login, which is part of the system's normal operation.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the API route) that's part of the system. Since the data is being exported from the same system, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component or system, it would be Changed (C). Here, it's within the same system, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows the extraction of sensitive data like password hashes and API keys. So the confidentiality impact is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability can lead to service integrity breaches. Since the attacker can export data, but does that affect the integrity of the system? The description mentions \"service integrity breaches,\" which might imply that the attacker could modify data or cause the system to behave incorrectly. However, the main issue here is data extraction, not modification. But the problem statement says \"disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches.\" So maybe the integrity impact is High (H) because the attacker could potentially alter data or cause the system to malfunction. Alternatively, if the integrity impact is about the data's integrity, but the vulnerability is about reading data, not modifying it. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. The CVSS guide says that Integrity (I) is High if there's a complete loss of integrity, or the attacker can modify data. Since the vulnerability allows exporting data, which is a confidentiality issue, but the integrity impact might be Low or None. However, the problem statement mentions \"service integrity breaches,\" which could imply that the attacker could cause the service to be compromised in a way that affects its integrity. Maybe the integrity impact is High. Alternatively, if the service integrity is breached through data leakage, but that's more about confidentiality. I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 guidelines again. The Integrity metric is High if the attacker can modify data, or if the system's integrity is compromised. Since the attacker can export data, which is a confidentiality issue, but the service integrity breaches might refer to the system's ability to maintain its integrity. However, without more details, maybe the integrity impact is High. Alternatively, if the service integrity is not directly affected by the data export, but the problem statement says it's a possible consequence, then maybe I is High. I'll go with High (H) for Integrity.\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability can lead to disruption of services. So the availability impact is High (H). The attacker could export data, which might cause the service to be unavailable or overloaded, but the description says \"disruption of services,\" which implies availability impact. So A is High (H).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low) – because the attacker needs to be a logged-in user, which is a low privilege requirement.\nUI: N (None) – no additional user interaction required beyond being logged in.\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: H (High)\n\nNow, the vector string would be:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\nWait, but earlier I thought PR might be N. Let me recheck that. The PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be a logged-in user, which is a normal user privilege, then PR is Low (L). If the system requires no privileges (like a guest user), then PR is N. But in this case, the user must be authenticated, which is a low privilege. So PR is Low (L). So the vector is as above.\n\nBut I need to confirm. The CVSS PR metric definitions:\n\n- None (N): No privileges required. The vulnerability is exploitable without any access to the system.\n- Low (L): The attacker must have some level of access, but not elevated privileges. For example, a normal user account.\n- High (H): The attacker must have elevated privileges, such as administrative access.\n\nIn this case, the attacker needs to be a logged-in user, which is a normal user, not elevated. So PR is Low (L). Therefore, the vector is correct.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 1.0, "success": true}

This is to prevent a possible integer underflow that might happen when copying the source scatterlist into a linear buffer.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's crypto module, specifically in the qat component. The issue is that there's a parameter check missing for DH Reject requests when the source buffer is larger than the key size. This could lead to an integer underflow when copying the scatterlist into a linear buffer.\n\nSo, the problem here is an integer underflow, which might allow an attacker to exploit this. But how does that translate into the CVSS metrics?\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. If the vulnerability can be exploited remotely without needing physical access, then AV would be Network (N). But if it requires local access, like a local user exploiting it, then it's Local (L). However, since the kernel is part of the system, and the vulnerability is in a component that might be used by applications, but the description doesn't mention remote exploitation. Wait, but the fix is about a parameter check for DH Reject requests. DH is Diffie-Hellman, which is used in cryptographic protocols. If this is part of a network service, then maybe it's exploitable over the network. But the description doesn't specify. Hmm. Without more info, I might have to assume that since it's a kernel vulnerability, it's possible that an attacker could exploit it locally, but maybe not. Alternatively, if the component is part of a network-facing service, then AV could be Network. But the description is vague. However, in the absence of specific information, I might default to Local (L) because kernel vulnerabilities often require local access unless stated otherwise. Wait, but some kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely. But without explicit mention, maybe it's safer to go with Local (L). But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the handling of DH Reject requests. If the system is using a network protocol that involves DH, then maybe an attacker could send a crafted request over the network. But the description doesn't say that. So maybe AV is Local (L) because it's a local kernel issue. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the component is part of a network service, then AV could be Network. But the description doesn't specify. Hmm. Maybe I should check standard assumptions. Typically, kernel vulnerabilities that are not in network services are considered Local. So I'll go with AV: Local (L) for now.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is due to a missing parameter check leading to an integer underflow. Exploiting this would require specific conditions, like crafting a request with a buffer size larger than the key. If the attacker needs to have precise control over the input to trigger the underflow, then AC is High (H). But if it's a simple case where the attacker can just send a malformed request, then AC is Low (L). Since the vulnerability is an integer underflow, which can be exploited with a specific input, maybe AC is Low. But I'm not sure. Integer underflows can sometimes be tricky to exploit, but if the code is vulnerable to it, then the attacker might need to know the exact conditions. However, in this case, the fix is adding a parameter check, which suggests that the vulnerability is exploitable by sending a request with a buffer size that's larger than the key. So maybe AC is Low. I'll tentatively go with AC: Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). If the attacker needs to have some privileges to exploit this, like being a local user, then PR would be Low or High. But if the vulnerability can be exploited by an unprivileged user, then PR is None (N). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the system, an attacker would need to have some way to trigger the code. If the code is part of a service that's accessible to unprivileged users, then PR could be None. But if the code is only accessible to privileged users, then PR would be High. However, the description doesn't specify. But since it's a kernel vulnerability, it's possible that an attacker could exploit it with local access, which would require some privileges. But if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that's used by user-space applications, maybe an unprivileged user could trigger it. For example, if the DH Reject requests are part of a network service that's accessible to users, then PR could be None. But again, without more info, I'm not sure. However, in many cases, kernel vulnerabilities that are not in network services require local access, so PR would be None (N) if the attacker can exploit it without needing elevated privileges. Wait, but if the attacker is a local user, they already have some privileges. But the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without needing any additional privileges beyond what a normal user has, then PR is None. If they need to be root, then PR is High. But since the vulnerability is in the kernel, maybe it's possible that a local user can exploit it without needing elevated privileges. So PR: None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). If the attacker needs the user to interact with the system (like clicking a link or opening a file), then UI is Required (R). If the attack can be done automatically without user interaction, then UI is None (N). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit would be triggered by a crafted input (like a network request or a specific system call), it's likely that UI is None (N). So UI: None (N).\n\nScope (S). This is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit would affect the kernel's functionality, the scope is Unchanged (U). So S: Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A). These are the impact metrics. The vulnerability is an integer underflow that could lead to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues. If exploited, this could allow an attacker to read or write arbitrary memory, leading to information disclosure, privilege escalation, or denial of service. However, the description doesn't specify the exact impact. But since it's a kernel vulnerability, the potential impact is high. For example, if the underflow leads to a buffer overflow, the attacker could execute arbitrary code, which would affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. So C: High (H), I: High (H), A: High (H). But maybe the actual impact is not certain. However, in the absence of specific information, the default for a vulnerability that allows arbitrary code execution is High for all three. So I'll go with C: H, I: H, A: H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: H (High)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n\nWait, but earlier I was considering AV as Network (N) if the vulnerability is in a network service. But the description doesn't mention that. However, the fix is for DH Reject requests, which are part of cryptographic protocols, which are often network-based. So maybe AV is Network (N). That would change the AV metric. Let me re-examine that.\n\nIf the vulnerability is in a component that handles network traffic (like a cryptographic library used in network protocols), then an attacker could exploit it remotely. For example, if the system is using a network service that performs Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and the attacker sends a malformed request, then AV would be Network (N). However, the description says it's in the Linux kernel's crypto module. The kernel's crypto module might be used by various services, but without explicit mention of network exposure, it's safer to assume that the attack vector is Local (L). But I'm not sure. This is a bit ambiguous. However, in the absence of specific information, I think the default for kernel vulnerabilities is Local (L) unless stated otherwise. So I'll stick with AV: L.\n\nBut I'm a bit conflicted here. If the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that's used by network services, then AV could be Network. But without that info, I have to make an educated guess. Since the description doesn't mention network exposure, I'll go with AV: Local (L).\n\nSo the final vector string would be as above.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 2.9000000000000004, "success": true}

This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-4166, is fixed in Vault Community 1.19.3 and Vault Enterprise 1.19.3, 1.18.9, 1.17.16, 1.16.20.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in the Vault Key/Value plugin version 2, where submitting malformed payloads during secret creation or update via the REST API could expose sensitive info in server and audit logs. The fix is in specific versions, so the vulnerability is about data exposure through logs due to improper handling of malformed inputs.\n\nNow, I need to assign each of the base metrics. Let's go one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is exploited via the REST API, which is network-based. So AV is Network (N). Because the attack doesn't require physical access or adjacent network, it's over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says \"malformed payloads\" are submitted. If the attack requires specific conditions, like a particular payload structure, that might be high. But if it's a simple malformed input, maybe low. However, since it's a server-side issue, maybe the attacker just needs to send a malformed request, which is low complexity. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user is submitting payloads via the REST API. If the user doesn't need any special privileges, like just a regular user, then PR is None (N). But if they need admin rights, it would be High. The description doesn't mention needing elevated privileges, so PR is N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack requires the user to submit a malformed payload. If the user interaction is required, like the user has to perform an action, then UI is Required (R). But if it's automatic, like a server-side processing error, maybe not. However, the user has to send the malformed payload, so UI is Required (R)? Wait, but in some cases, if the attack is triggered by the user's action, like a request, then UI is Required. But in CVSS, UI is about whether the user needs to interact with the system. Since the user is the one sending the request, maybe UI is None? Wait, no. The UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be triggered without user interaction, like a remote exploit, then UI is None. But here, the user has to send the request, which is their interaction. So UI is Required (R). Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. The UI metric is whether the attack requires user interaction. If the user has to perform an action (like sending a request), then UI is Required. But if the attack is automatic, like a buffer overflow that doesn't need user input, then UI is None. In this case, the user is the one initiating the request, so UI is Required. But wait, the user is the attacker here. So maybe the UI is not required because the attacker is the one interacting. Wait, the UI metric is about whether the user (the victim) needs to interact. Wait, no. The UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be done without any user interaction, like a remote exploit, then UI is None. If the user (the attacker) has to interact, like send a request, then UI is Required. But in CVSS, the user interaction is from the perspective of the victim. Wait, no. The UI metric is whether the attack requires user interaction. For example, if the attack requires the user to click a link, then UI is Required. If the attack is automatic, like a buffer overflow, then UI is None. In this case, the attacker sends a malformed payload via the API. The user (victim) doesn't need to interact; the attacker is the one interacting. But the UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. So if the attack can be done without any user interaction (from the victim's side), then UI is None. But in this case, the attacker is the one interacting. So maybe UI is None? Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me check the CVSS documentation. According to CVSS, User Interaction (UI) is the requirement for a user to interact with the system for the attack to be successful. If the attack requires the user to perform an action (like clicking a link), then UI is Required. If the attack can be done without user interaction, like a remote exploit, then UI is None. In this case, the attacker is sending a request to the server. The user (victim) doesn't need to interact. The attacker is the one interacting. So the UI is None? Or is the attacker considered part of the user? Wait, the user here is the attacker. So the attack requires the attacker to interact with the system. But the UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be done without any user interaction (from the victim's side), then UI is None. But the attacker is the one interacting. So maybe UI is None. Wait, but the attacker is the one initiating the request. So the attack requires the attacker to interact with the system. But the UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be done without any user interaction (from the victim's side), then UI is None. But the attacker is the one interacting. So in this case, the attack requires the attacker to interact, but the victim doesn't. So UI is None. Hmm, I think I need to check examples. For example, a buffer overflow that can be triggered remotely without user interaction would have UI: None. A phishing attack that requires the user to click a link would have UI: Required. In this case, the attacker sends a request to the server. The user (victim) doesn't need to do anything. So the attack doesn't require user interaction. Therefore, UI is None (N). Wait, but the attacker is the one sending the request. So the attack requires the attacker to interact. But the UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be done without any user interaction (from the victim's side), then UI is None. So in this case, the answer is UI: None. So I think UI is N.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the server-side component. The attack affects the same component, so the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allows access to a different component, then it's Changed. But here, the logs are part of the same system, so S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability exposes sensitive information in logs. So the confidentiality impact is High (H), because the attacker can gain access to sensitive data.\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability doesn't modify data, just exposes it. So Integrity is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): The vulnerability doesn't affect availability. The server is still operational, just logs have sensitive info. So Availability is None (N).\n\nWait, but the description says \"unintentionally expose sensitive information in server and audit logs\". So the confidentiality is impacted (C:H), but integrity and availability are not. So I and A are N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: N (None)\nA: N (None)\n\nSo the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\nWait, but earlier I was confused about UI. Let me recheck. If the attack requires the attacker to send a malformed payload, which is an action they take, but the victim doesn't need to interact. So UI is None.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Front End Users plugin for WordPress. It's due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the forgot-password shortcode. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts, which execute when a user accesses the injected page.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is exploitable via the plugin's shortcode, which is part of the web application. Since it's a stored XSS, the attack doesn't require network access beyond the application's own network. However, since the attacker can inject scripts that are stored and executed when users access the page, the attack vector is likely Network (N) because the exploit is delivered through the web application's network interface. Even though the user is authenticated, the initial attack vector is still through the network.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions that the attacker needs to have contributor-level access. However, the exploit itself (injecting the script) might be straightforward once the attacker has access. Since the vulnerability is stored, the attacker can inject the script once, and it's executed when others view the page. The complexity here is low because the attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps beyond exploiting the input vulnerability. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access. In CVSS terms, this is considered Low (L) because the attacker doesn't need high privileges, but they do need some level of access. However, the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). Since the attacker must be authenticated, but not with administrative privileges, it's Low. Wait, but contributor-level access in WordPress is a specific role. However, the CVSS PR metric considers the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated (i.e., have some level of access), then PR is Low. If the attacker could exploit it without any authentication, it would be None. But here, the attacker must be authenticated, so PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is stored, meaning the attacker injects the script into the system, and when a user accesses the page, the script executes. The user doesn't need to interact with the attacker's input; the script runs automatically when the page is loaded. Therefore, User Interaction is None (N). If the attack required the user to click on a link or interact, it would be Required (R), but in stored XSS, it's automatic upon page load.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component (the plugin) that the attacker is interacting with. Since the attack is within the same security scope (the plugin's functionality), the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component or scope (like a different system), it would be Changed (C). Here, it's within the same scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which allows an attacker to inject scripts that can steal session cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on their behalf. This impacts confidentiality (stealing data), integrity (modifying data), and availability (denial of service via script execution). However, the CVSS metrics for these are based on the impact. Since the attacker can inject arbitrary scripts, the impact is High (H) for all three. The attacker can read data (C:H), modify data (I:H), and potentially disrupt the service (A:H). However, sometimes availability might be considered lower if the attack doesn't directly impact the system's availability. But in stored XSS, the script can cause the page to malfunction or be redirected, which could affect availability. So I think all three are High.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: H (High)\n\nNow, the vector string would be CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. Wait, but earlier I thought PR was Low. Let me check again. The attacker needs contributor-level access, which is a specific privilege. In CVSS, PR is the level of privileges required. If the attacker needs to be authenticated (i.e., have some level of access), then PR is Low. If the attacker could exploit it without any authentication, it's None. Since the attacker must be authenticated, PR is Low (L).

First, I need to go through the CVE description and figure out each metric based on the given options.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). The description says the attack can be initiated remotely. That usually means Network (N), since it's over the network without needing physical access. So AV is N.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The vulnerability is a denial of service caused by manipulating an argument. If it's a simple exploit that doesn't require complex steps, then AC is Low (L). The description doesn't mention anything complicated, so I'll go with L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attack is initiated remotely, and there's no mention of needing any user privileges.

The exploit is initiated remotely, and the description doesn't mention needing user interaction. So UI is None (N). If the attack can be done without the user doing anything, that's N.\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability is in the API Interface component. If the vulnerability affects the same component that's being attacked, the scope is Unchanged (U).

First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Simple Pricing Tables plugin for WordPress. The issue is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the 'wdo_simple_pricing_table_free' shortcode. The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject scripts, which then execute when a user accesses the affected page.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is stored, meaning the payload is stored on the server and executed when a user accesses the page. Since it's stored, the attack vector is likely Network (N) because the attacker doesn't need to be physically present or adjacent. They can exploit it over the network by submitting the malicious input through the web interface.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). The description mentions that the attacker needs to inject the script via the shortcode, which might require some specific input but not necessarily complex steps. However, since it's a stored XSS, the attack complexity is usually Low (L) because the attacker just needs to inject the script into the system, which is straightforward once they have access.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access. Contributor access in WordPress allows users to create and edit posts but not publish them. However, the plugin's vulnerability allows them to inject scripts. Since the attacker needs some level of access (contributor or higher), PR is Low (L). Wait, but the options are None (N), Low (L), High (H). If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. But in CVSS, if the attacker needs to have some privileges, like user-level access, that's considered Low. If it's admin-level, that's High. Here, contributor is a lower privilege than admin, so PR is Low (L). But wait, the original question says \"authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above\". So the attacker needs to have contributor access, which is a privilege. So PR is Low (L) because it's not high-level admin access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI). The vulnerability is stored, so the user doesn't need to interact with the malicious input. The script is executed when the user accesses the page, but the user doesn't have to perform any action beyond viewing the page. Therefore, UI is None (N). Wait, but sometimes stored XSS requires the user to view the page, but the user interaction is not required for the attack to occur. The attacker doesn't need the user to click a link or interact; just viewing the page is enough. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). The vulnerability affects the same component where the attack is initiated. Since the plugin is part of the WordPress site, and the attack is within the same application context, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component or system, it would be Changed (C), but here it's within the same application.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). The vulnerability is XSS, which can lead to stealing session cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the site. So all three impacts are High (H). The attacker can read data (C:H), modify data (I:H), and potentially disrupt the site (A:H), though availability might be less direct. However, in CVSS, for XSS, the impact on confidentiality and integrity is typically High, and availability might be Low or None. Wait, but the description says the script is injected and executed when a user accesses the page. So the attacker can steal data (C:H), inject malicious scripts (I:H), but does it affect availability? Maybe not directly. However, the CVSS guidelines for XSS usually assign C:H, I:H, A:N. Wait, but the original question says to choose between N, L, H. Let me check the CVSS v3.1 guidelines.\n\nIn CVSS v3.1, for XSS, the impact metrics are typically:\n\n- Confidentiality: High (H) because the attacker can steal session cookies or other sensitive data.\n- Integrity: High (H) because the attacker can inject malicious scripts that alter the content or perform actions on behalf of the user.\n- Availability: None (N) unless the XSS leads to a denial of service, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, C:H, I:H, A:N.\n\nWait, but the problem says the attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts. So the impact on confidentiality is high (stealing data), integrity is high (modifying content), and availability is none unless the script causes the site to crash, which isn't stated. So A:N.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Network (N) – because the attack is over the network.\nAC: Low (L) – the attack is straightforward once the attacker has access.\nPR: Low (L) – requires contributor-level access, which is a privilege but not high.\nUI: None (N) – no user interaction required beyond viewing the page.\nS: Unchanged (U) – same component.\nC: High (H) – confidentiality impact.\nI: High (H) – integrity impact.\nA: None (N) – no availability impact.\n\nSo the vector string would be AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N. Wait, but earlier I thought PR was Low (L) because contributor access is a privilege. But in the options, PR can be N, L, H. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's a privilege requirement. However, in CVSS, if the attacker needs to have some level of access (like user-level), that's considered Low. If it's admin-level, that's High. Since contributor is a lower privilege, PR is Low (L). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but the original description says \"authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above\". So the attacker must be authenticated, which is a privilege. So PR is Low (L) because it's not High. So that's correct.\n\nSo the final vector string would be:\n\nAV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nBut wait, the user interaction is None (N) because the user doesn't need to interact beyond viewing the page.

In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it is possible for any authenticated user, through the use of the filemanager to delete any file owned by the user running the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) on the host without any limitation on the filesystem's scope. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to arbitrarily remove content from the Wiki resulting in partial loss of data and defacement/deterioration of the website. In the context of a container installation of YesWiki without any modification, the `yeswiki` files (for example .php) are not owned by the same user (root) as the one running the FPM process (www-data). However in a standard installation, www-data may also be the owner of the PHP files, allowing a malicious user to completely cut the access to the wiki by deleting all important PHP files (like index.php or core files of YesWiki). Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for this issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is in YesWiki versions up to 4.4.5. The issue is that any authenticated user can delete any file owned by the user running the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) via the filemanager. This can lead to data loss and website defacement. The patch is in 4.5.0.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is exploited through the filemanager, which is part of the web application. Since it's a web-based system, the attack vector is likely Network (N). The user doesn't need physical access or adjacent network access; they just need to be authenticated and access the web interface.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says \"any authenticated user\" can exploit this. It doesn't mention any specific steps or conditions that make the attack complex. So, the attack complexity is Low (L). The user just needs to use the filemanager, which is a straightforward process once authenticated.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The user needs to be authenticated. However, the description says \"any authenticated user,\" which implies that the attacker doesn't need high privileges. But wait, the vulnerability allows deletion of files owned by the FPM user. If the user is authenticated, but the files are owned by a different user (like www-data), does that require any specific privileges? Hmm. Wait, the user is authenticated, but the files are owned by the FPM user. If the attacker is authenticated, maybe they have some level of access. However, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since the user is already authenticated, but the attack is against the FPM user's files, maybe the attacker needs to have the same privileges as the FPM user. But the description says \"any authenticated user\" can do this. So perhaps the PR is Low (L) because the user is already authenticated, but maybe not. Wait, the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already authenticated, then the privileges required might be Low. But if the attacker needs to have certain permissions (like being a user with access to the filemanager), but the description says \"any authenticated user\" can do it. So maybe PR is Low. Alternatively, if the user is authenticated but the attack requires specific permissions (like being able to access the filemanager), but the description doesn't mention that. So I think PR is Low (L) because the user is authenticated, and the attack doesn't require additional privileges beyond that.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The attack requires the user to be authenticated. But does the user need to interact with the system in a way that's required for the attack? The description says \"any authenticated user, through the use of the filemanager to delete any file...\" So the user needs to be authenticated (which is a form of user interaction, but UI in CVSS is about whether the attack requires user interaction beyond the initial authentication). Wait, the UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be done without any further user interaction after initial authentication, then UI is None (N). But if the user needs to perform an action (like clicking a link or entering a command), then it's Required (R). However, the description says the user can delete files through the filemanager. So the user has to interact with the filemanager, which is part of the application. But since the user is already authenticated, the UI might be None (N) because the attack doesn't require additional user interaction beyond the initial authentication. Wait, but the initial authentication is part of the attack. Hmm. The UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be triggered without any user interaction (like a remote exploit), then UI is None. If the attack requires the user to perform an action (like visiting a malicious link), then UI is Required. In this case, the user has to be authenticated and use the filemanager, which is a user action. But the UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. Since the user is authenticated and uses the filemanager, which is a user action, but the attack is initiated by the user. However, the UI metric in CVSS v3.1 is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be done without any user interaction (like a remote exploit that doesn't need the user to do anything), then UI is None. If the attack requires the user to perform an action (like visiting a malicious link or clicking a button), then UI is Required. In this case, the user has to be authenticated and use the filemanager, which is a user action. So the UI is Required (R)? Wait, but the user is already authenticated. The initial authentication is part of the attack. However, the UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be done without any user interaction (like a remote exploit that doesn't need the user to do anything), then UI is None. If the attack requires the user to perform an action (like visiting a malicious link or entering a command), then UI is Required. In this case, the user has to be authenticated and use the filemanager, which is a user action. So the UI is Required (R). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the CVSS documentation. The UI metric is \"whether user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.\" If the attack requires the user to perform an action (like clicking a link), then it's Required. If the attack can be done without any user interaction (like a remote exploit that doesn't need the user to do anything), then it's None. In this case, the user has to be authenticated and use the filemanager. So the user has to interact with the system (use the filemanager), which is a user action. Therefore, UI is Required (R). But wait, the initial authentication is part of the attack. However, the UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction beyond the initial authentication. For example, if the attack requires the user to click a link, that's Required. If the attack can be done automatically once the user is authenticated, then UI is None. But in this case, the user has to be authenticated and then perform an action (delete a file via the filemanager). So the UI is Required (R). Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe the UI is None because the attack is initiated by the user being authenticated, and the attack is done through the application's interface. Wait, the CVSS UI metric is about whether the attack requires user interaction. If the attack can be done without any user interaction (like a remote exploit that doesn't need the user to do anything), then UI is None. If the attack requires the user to perform an action (like visiting a malicious link), then UI is Required. In this case, the user has to be authenticated and use the filemanager, which is a user action. So the UI is Required (R). But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again. The user is authenticated, which is a form of user interaction. But the attack itself is done through the filemanager, which is a user action. So the UI is Required (R). Alternatively, if the attack is done through the application's interface, which the user is already authenticated to, then maybe the UI is None. But I think the correct answer here is Required (R) because the user has to perform an action (delete the file) via the filemanager. So UI is R.\n\nScope (S): The scope is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). The vulnerability allows deletion of files owned by the FPM user. If the FPM user is different from the application's user, then the scope might be Changed. However, in a standard installation, the FPM user (www-data) may own the PHP files. So the vulnerability affects the same component (the application's files), so the scope is Unchanged (U). Wait, the scope is about whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). If the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component (like the FPM user's files), then the scope is Changed. But in the case of a standard installation where the FPM user (www-data) owns the PHP files, the attacker is deleting files that are part of the same application. So the scope is Unchanged (U). However, if the FPM user is different from the application's user, then the scope might be Changed. But the description says that in a container installation, the files are not owned by the same user (root vs www-data), but in a standard installation, www-data may own the PHP files. So depending on the installation, the scope could be different. However, the CVSS base score is calculated based on the worst-case scenario. Since the vulnerability can affect different components (like in container installations), the scope is Changed (C). Wait, but the CVSS base score is based on the vulnerability's characteristics, not the specific deployment. The scope metric is about whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). If the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect a different component (like the FPM user's files, which are part of the system but not the application itself), then the scope is Changed.

This issue is fixed in macOS Sequoia 15.3, iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3. An app may be able to view a contact's phone number in system logs.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description. The issue is a privacy problem where an app might be able to view a contact's phone number in system logs. The fix is in macOS Sequoia 15.3, iOS 18.3, and iPadOS 18.3.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). The description says an app may be able to view the phone number. Since it's about system logs, which are typically accessible via the network or local system. But the app is on the same device, so maybe it's local? Wait, but if the logs are accessible over the network, maybe AV is Network (N). However, the app is on the same device, so maybe it's Local (L). Hmm, but the vulnerability allows an app to access the logs, which might be through the system's internal processes. So maybe AV is Local (L) because the attacker needs to have access to the device. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the logs are accessible via a network service, then AV would be Network. But the description doesn't mention network access. It's more about an app on the same device accessing logs. So I think AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The description says \"may be able to view,\" which suggests that it's not complex. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The app needs to be running on the device. If the app is already installed and running, maybe it doesn't need high privileges. But if the app needs to have certain permissions, maybe Low (L). However, if the app can access the logs without any special privileges, then PR is None (N). Wait, the app is already on the device, so maybe it's using existing permissions. But the vulnerability is that the app can access the logs, which might require some level of access. But the description doesn't specify. Since it's a privacy issue, maybe the app doesn't need elevated privileges. So PR is None (N) or Low (L). Hmm. If the app is already running, maybe it doesn't need any additional privileges. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The user interaction is required? If the app needs the user to do something, like click a link, then UI is Required (R). But the description says the app may be able to view the phone number. If the app can do this without user interaction, then UI is None (N). Since it's a system log, maybe the app can access it automatically. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component, so Scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability is in the same component, then S is U. If it's in a different component, it's Changed (C). Since the logs are part of the system, and the app is accessing them, it's likely the same scope. So S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The issue is that the app can view a contact's phone number, which is a confidentiality issue. So C is High (H) because the data is sensitive.\n\nIntegrity (I): The description doesn't mention any integrity issues. The app is just reading data, not modifying it. So I is None (N).\n\nAvailability (A): Similarly, there's no mention of availability impact. So A is None (N).\n\nWait, but the CVSS v3.1 metrics for confidentiality, integrity, and availability are each rated as None (N), Low (L), or High (H). Since the vulnerability allows access to sensitive data (phone numbers), that's a confidentiality impact. So C is High (H). Integrity and Availability are not affected, so they are None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) or Network (N)? Let me recheck. If the app is on the same device, then AV is Local. But if the logs are accessible over the network, maybe AV is Network. However, the description doesn't mention network access. It's more about an app on the device accessing logs. So AV is Local (L). But wait, in some cases, if the logs are accessible via a network service, even if the app is on the same device, but that's not specified here. The default for such issues is often Local. So I'll go with AV:L.\n\nPR: If the app is already installed and running, maybe it doesn't need any privileges. So PR:N. But if the app needs to have certain permissions, maybe PR:L. However, the description doesn't mention that. So PR:N.\n\nUI:N, as no user interaction is needed.\n\nS:U.\n\nC:H, I:N, A:N.\n\nSo the vector would be AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about AV. Let me think again. If the app is on the same device, but the logs are part of the system, maybe the attack vector is Local. But sometimes, if the logs are accessible via a network service, even if the app is on the same device, but that's not mentioned here. The CVE description doesn't specify network access, so AV is Local (L). Alternatively, if the logs are accessible via a network, but the app is on the same device, maybe AV is Local. But I think AV is Local here.\n\nSo the final vector would be:\n\nAV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n\nBut wait, the example given in the problem has AV:N. Maybe I'm wrong. Let me check again. The vulnerability allows an app to view the phone number in system logs. If the app is on the same device, then the attack vector is Local. But if the logs are accessible over the network, then it's Network. However, the description doesn't mention network access. So I think AV is Local (L). But sometimes, in iOS/macOS, system logs might be accessible via a network service, but that's not specified here. So I'll stick with AV:L.\n\nBut I'm a bit uncertain. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. For example, if the attack requires the attacker to have access to the system, then AV is Local. If it's through a network, then AV is Network. Since the app is on the same device, AV is Local. So AV:L.\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "score": 2.9000000000000004, "success": true}

This issue affects Free Shipping Bar: Amount Left for Free Shipping for WooCommerce: from n/a through 2.4.6.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 calculation. The CVE is about a Stored XSS vulnerability in a WordPress plugin. First, I need to recall the CVSS v3.1 metrics and how they apply here.\n\nStarting with Attack Vector (AV). Since it's a web application vulnerability that can be exploited through a web page, the attack vector is likely Network (N). Because the attacker doesn't need physical access or adjacent network, just the web.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. Stored XSS usually requires the attacker to inject the payload into the application, which might be straightforward. So AC is Low (L). If it required complex steps, it would be High, but Stored XSS is often low complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). For Stored XSS, the attacker might not need any special privileges. The user might just need to submit the malicious input, which the application stores. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). Stored XSS doesn't require the user to interact with the malicious input once it's stored. The user might have to visit the page where the XSS is stored, but the initial injection doesn't require interaction. Wait, but some definitions say that if the user has to trigger the attack (like clicking a link), then UI is Required. However, in Stored XSS, the payload is stored in the application, and when another user views the page, the script executes. So the user interaction here is the initial visit to the page, but the vulnerability itself doesn't require user interaction to exploit. Hmm, maybe UI is None. Wait, the CVSS definition for UI: Required if the user must interact with the attack for it to be successful. In Stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact with the attack vector; the attacker just needs to inject the script, and when another user views the page, the script runs. So UI is None (N). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. According to CVSS, if the attack requires the user to perform an action (like clicking a link), then UI is Required. But in Stored XSS, the user doesn't need to do anything; the script is executed automatically when they load the page. So UI is None. So I think UI is N.\n\nScope (S) is Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability is in the same component (the web application) and doesn't affect other components. If it was a vulnerability that allowed access to another component, it would be Changed. But here, the scope remains the same.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are all High (H) because XSS can lead to data theft (C), data modification (I), and potentially DoS if the script is malicious. However, the actual impact depends on the exploit. Since the vulnerability is a Stored XSS, it can allow an attacker to steal session cookies, leading to confidentiality loss. It can also inject malicious scripts to alter content (integrity) or cause the site to behave incorrectly (availability). So all three are High.\n\nPutting it all together: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:H.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation and sanitization of user input in SVG markdown support within the chatbot feature. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SVG content, which can execute arbitrary JavaScript code when viewed by an admin, potentially leading to credential theft.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a stored XSS in the langgenius/dify application, specifically in the SVG markdown support of the chatbot feature. The issue arises from improper validation and sanitization of user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SVG content. When an admin views this content, it executes arbitrary JavaScript, leading to credential theft.\n\nStarting with the Attack Vector (AV). Since the vulnerability is stored and the input is processed in a chatbot feature, which is likely accessed over the network, the attack vector is Network (N). The attacker doesn't need physical access or adjacent network access; they can exploit it remotely.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC) is next. The description mentions that the attacker injects malicious SVG content. Since SVG is a common format and the vulnerability is due to improper sanitization, the attack complexity is likely Low (L). The attacker doesn't need to perform complex steps beyond injecting the SVG code.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR) refers to the level of access the attacker needs. The vulnerability is stored, meaning the attacker can inject the payload without needing any prior authentication. However, the exploit requires the admin to view the content. Wait, but the attacker might need to have the ability to post the malicious SVG in the chatbot. If the chatbot allows any user to input content, then the attacker might not need privileges. But if the chatbot is restricted to authenticated users, then the attacker would need some privileges. However, the description says \"improper validation and sanitization of user input,\" which suggests that the input is from users, so maybe the attacker can inject it without needing elevated privileges. But since the exploit is triggered when an admin views it, the attacker might not need admin privileges themselves. So PR is None (N) because the attacker doesn't need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability; they just need to inject the content, which might be possible as a regular user.\n\nUser Interaction (UI) is about whether the user needs to interact for the attack to succeed. Since it's a stored XSS, the attacker's payload is stored and executed when the admin views it. The admin's interaction (viewing the content) is required. Therefore, UI is Required (R). Wait, but stored XSS typically requires the user to view the content. However, in some cases, if the payload is automatically executed without user interaction, UI might be None. But in this case, the description says \"when viewed by an admin,\" which implies that the admin's action (viewing) is necessary. So UI is Required (R).\n\nScope (S) is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged) or a different component (Changed). Since the vulnerability is in the chatbot feature of the application, and the impact is on the admin's session (credential theft), the scope is Unchanged (U). The attack doesn't involve a different component or a different scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are the impact metrics. The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript, leading to credential theft. This directly impacts confidentiality (C: High), as credentials are stolen. Integrity (I) is also High because the attacker can manipulate the admin's session or inject malicious code. Availability (A) might be High if the attack can cause denial of service, but the description doesn't mention that. However, since the attack is XSS, the primary impact is on confidentiality and integrity. Availability might be None (N) unless the XSS can disrupt the service. Since the description doesn't mention availability issues, I'll set A to None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: N (None)\nUI: R (Required)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nNow, constructing the vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel related to a null pointer dereference when xps sysfs allocation fails. The fix involves ensuring that xps_sysfs is initialized to NULL to prevent an oops during destruction.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the description mentions that it's related to sysfs operations. Since sysfs is part of the kernel's filesystem and can be accessed via the system's file system, which is typically accessible over the network or locally. However, the exploit would require some interaction with the system. But since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attack vector isn't specified as requiring network access, but the sysfs is a local interface. However, in some cases, kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger them. But the description doesn't mention remote exploitation. So maybe AV is Local (L) or Adjacent (A)? Wait, Adjacent is for local network, but if it's a local kernel issue, AV is Local (L). But I need to check if the vulnerability can be exploited remotely. The description doesn't mention that, so I think AV is Local (L). But wait, sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited via local user access. So AV is Local (L).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference. To exploit this, an attacker would need to trigger the specific condition where xps sysfs allocation fails. This might require specific steps, but if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that's commonly used, maybe the attack complexity is Low (L). However, if it's a specific scenario that's not easy to trigger, it might be High (H). The description says that when the allocation fails, the code doesn't handle it properly. So an attacker would need to cause the allocation to fail, which might be possible through certain operations. But I think the attack complexity is Low because it's a straightforward condition that can be triggered with specific inputs. So AC is Low (L).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit would require some level of access. If the attacker needs to have root privileges to exploit this, then PR is High (H). But if it's a local user who can trigger the condition without elevated privileges, then PR is None (N) or Low (L). However, since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the sysfs is accessible to local users, but the exploit would require the attacker to have the ability to trigger the allocation failure. If the attacker is a local user, they might not need elevated privileges. But if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that's only accessible to privileged users, then PR would be High. However, the description doesn't specify that. So I think PR is None (N) because the vulnerability can be exploited by a local user without requiring any special privileges. Wait, but in the kernel, some sysfs entries might require certain permissions. However, the vulnerability is a null pointer dereference, which could be triggered by a local user with normal privileges. So PR is None (N) or Low (L)? Hmm. If the attacker needs to have some level of access, like being a local user, but not necessarily root, then PR is Low (L). But the CVSS PR metric for kernel vulnerabilities often considers if the attacker needs privileges. If the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that's accessible to any user, then PR is None (N). But I'm not sure. Maybe I should check examples. For example, if a vulnerability in a user-space application requires no privileges, but in the kernel, maybe it's different. Wait, the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without any privileges, then PR is None. If they need to have some level of access, like being a local user, then PR is Low. But in the case of a kernel vulnerability, even a local user can trigger certain conditions. However, the PR metric in CVSS v3.1 for kernel vulnerabilities is often considered as None (N) if the attacker can exploit it without needing any special privileges beyond being a local user. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should go with PR: None (N) because the vulnerability is in the kernel and can be triggered by a local user without needing elevated privileges. Wait, but the kernel is protected, so maybe the attacker needs to have some level of access. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The vulnerability is in the kernel, but the exploit would require the attacker to have the ability to trigger the allocation failure. If the attacker is a local user, they can do that. So the privileges required are None (N) because the attacker doesn't need to have any special privileges beyond being a local user. So PR is None (N).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference that occurs when the allocation fails. The exploit would require the attacker to perform some action that causes the allocation to fail. If the attacker needs to interact with the system (like sending a specific request), then UI is Required (R). However, if the vulnerability can be triggered automatically without user interaction, then UI is None (N). The description doesn't mention user interaction, but the exploit would require the attacker to perform some action that leads to the allocation failure. For example, if the attacker can send a request that causes the allocation to fail, then UI is Required (R). But if the vulnerability is in a part of the system that's automatically triggered, then UI is None. However, in this case, the vulnerability is in the sysfs, which is a part of the kernel's filesystem. So an attacker would need to interact with the sysfs, which might require some user interaction. But if the attacker can trigger it through a system call or a specific operation, then UI is None. I think UI is None (N) because the vulnerability can be triggered through system operations without requiring the user to interact with the system in a way that's outside of normal operations. Wait, but the UI metric is about whether user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. If the attacker needs to trick a user into performing an action, then UI is Required. If the attacker can exploit it without user interaction, then UI is None. In this case, the attacker would need to perform an action that causes the allocation to fail, which might be done through a system call or a specific input. So UI is None (N) because the attack can be initiated without requiring the user to interact with the system. So UI: None (N).\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability is in the kernel, and the impact is on the kernel itself. Since the vulnerability is in the same component (the kernel), the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability affects a different component, like a service that's part of the system, then the scope would be Changed (C). But here, the vulnerability is within the kernel, so S: Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference, which can lead to a system crash (availability) but not necessarily a leak of data (confidentiality) or corruption of data (integrity). However, a null pointer dereference can cause a denial of service (DoS), which affects availability. So C: None (N), I: None (N), A: High (H) because the vulnerability can lead to a system crash, which is a high impact on availability. Wait, but the CVSS metrics for availability: High (H) is when the vulnerability can cause a complete loss of availability, such as a system crash. So in this case, the null pointer dereference would cause the system to crash, leading to a DoS. Therefore, A: High (H). C and I are None (N) because the vulnerability doesn't expose data or modify data, just causes a crash.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: Local (L) – because the vulnerability is in the kernel and requires local access to exploit.\nAC: Low (L) – the attack is straightforward once the allocation failure is triggered.\nPR: None (N) – the attacker doesn't need elevated privileges beyond being a local user.\nUI: None (N) – the attack can be triggered without user interaction.\nS: Unchanged (U) – the vulnerability affects the same component (kernel).\nC: None (N) – no impact on confidentiality.\nI: None (N) – no impact on integrity.\nA: High (H) – the vulnerability can cause a system crash, affecting availability.\n\nNow, the CVSS vector string would be:\n\nAV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nBut wait, the attack vector (AV) was initially thought to be Local (L), but sometimes kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger them. However, the description doesn't mention remote exploitation. So AV is Local (L). But I need to confirm. If the vulnerability is in the kernel and can be triggered by a local user, then AV is Local. If it's a remote code execution, then AV is Network.

So handle this cases and avoid a NULL pointer derefence in vchiq_dump_platform_instances.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description provided. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's vchiq_arm module. The issue is that vchiq_get_state() can return a NULL pointer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference in vchiq_dump_platform_instances. The fix was to handle these cases to avoid the dereference.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a kernel module, an attacker would need to have some way to trigger this. But the description doesn't mention any specific attack vector. However, kernel vulnerabilities are often exploitable remotely if there's a way to trigger the issue from user space. But in this case, the problem is a NULL dereference. If the code is called from a user-space application, maybe through some interface, then AV could be Network (N). But if it's only exploitable locally, like through a local user with some access, then AV would be Local (L). However, since the kernel is part of the system, and the vulnerability is in a module that might be used by other components, I'm not sure. Wait, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so if an attacker can trigger this, maybe through a local exploit. But if the code is called from a user-space application, maybe through a system call or some interface, then it could be a local exploit. But without more info, I think the default for kernel vulnerabilities is often Local (L) unless there's a remote exploit path. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a local privilege escalation. Hmm. Let me think again. The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. If that's in a part of the kernel that's accessible via a system call or some user-space interaction, then an attacker could exploit it locally. So AV would be Local (L). But if the code is part of a driver that's accessed over the network, maybe. But the description doesn't mention that. So I'll go with Local (L) for AV.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): The vulnerability is a NULL dereference. To exploit this, the attacker would need to trigger the condition that causes vchiq_get_state() to return NULL. If that's a simple condition, like passing a specific parameter, then AC is Low (L). If it's complex, like requiring multiple steps, then High (H). Since the problem is a NULL pointer, which is a common issue, and the fix is to handle the NULL case, I think the attack complexity is Low. So AC is L.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): To exploit this, the attacker would need some level of access. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, an attacker would need to have local access to exploit it, perhaps with root privileges. But if the code is called from a user-space application, maybe the attacker doesn't need high privileges. However, since it's a kernel module, the exploit would require local access. So PR is High (H) if the attacker needs root, but maybe Low (L) if it's a local user without elevated privileges. Wait, but kernel vulnerabilities typically require local privileges to exploit. For example, a local user could exploit a kernel vulnerability to gain root access. So in this case, the attacker would need to have local access, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is already on the system, maybe they don't need high privileges. But the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, then the attacker would need to have some way to trigger the code, which might require local access. So PR would be High (H) if the attacker needs to have elevated privileges, but if the code is accessible via a user-space interface, maybe PR is Low. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me check. The PR metric is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attacker can exploit it from user space, then the attacker would need to have local access, but not necessarily root. However, in practice, kernel vulnerabilities are often exploited by local users with some privileges. But the PR metric for CVSS v3.1 is defined as: None (N) if no privileges are required, Low (L) if the attacker needs to have low privileges (like a normal user), and High (H) if the attacker needs high privileges (like root). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the attacker would need to have local access to trigger the code, but not necessarily root, maybe PR is Low (L). Wait, but if the code is part of the kernel, then the attacker would need to have the ability to execute code in the kernel, which would require some level of privilege. However, if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that's accessible via a system call or some user-space interface, then the attacker could exploit it without needing root. For example, if a user-space application can trigger the code that leads to the NULL dereference, then the attacker would need to have local access but not necessarily root. So PR would be Low (L). But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should go with Low (L) here.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The UI metric is whether user interaction is required. If the attacker needs the user to perform an action, like clicking a link, then UI is Required (R). If the attack can be done automatically, then UI is None (N). In this case, the vulnerability is a NULL dereference in the kernel. If the attacker can trigger it through a local exploit without user interaction, then UI is None (N). So I think UI is N.\n\nScope (S): The scope metric is whether the vulnerability affects the same component (Unchanged, U) or a different component (Changed, C). Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, and the exploit would affect the kernel itself, the scope is Unchanged (U). So S is U.\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): These are the impact metrics. The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which can lead to a crash (availability), but not necessarily data exposure (confidentiality) or data modification (integrity). However, a NULL dereference can cause a denial of service (DoS), so Availability (A) would be High (H) if the system crashes. But if the crash is not exploitable for DoS, maybe it's Low. However, in CVSS, if the vulnerability can cause a system crash, that's considered a High impact on Availability. For Confidentiality and Integrity, since the vulnerability is a NULL dereference, it's unlikely to leak data or modify data, so C and I would be None (N). Wait, but sometimes a NULL dereference can be exploited to gain unauthorized access. However, in this case, the fix is to avoid the dereference, so the original vulnerability would cause a crash. So the impact is on Availability. Therefore, C and I are N, and A is H.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: L (Local)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low)\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: N (None)\nI: N (None)\nA: H (High)\n\nWait, but earlier I was confused about PR. If the attacker needs local access but not root, then PR is Low. But if the attacker needs to have root to exploit it, then PR is High. However, in the case of a kernel vulnerability, the attacker would need to have the ability to execute code in the kernel, which typically requires root privileges. But if the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that's accessible via a user-space interface, then maybe the attacker can exploit it without root. For example, if a user-space application can trigger the code that leads to the NULL dereference, then the attacker would need to have local access but not necessarily root. However, in practice, kernel vulnerabilities are often exploited by local users with some privileges, but the PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without needing elevated privileges, then PR is Low. If they need root, then High. Since the description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is in the kernel, I think PR is High (H) because the attacker would need to have the ability to execute code in the kernel, which typically requires root. But I'm not 100% sure. This is a point of uncertainty. However, in the absence of specific information, I might default to High (H) for PR. Let me check some examples. For example, a kernel vulnerability that allows local privilege escalation would have PR as Low (L) because the attacker is a local user, but the exploit requires them to have some access. Wait, no. The PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker is a local user, they might not need high privileges to exploit it. For example, if the vulnerability is in a user-space application, PR is Low. But if it's in the kernel, the attacker would need to have the ability to trigger the code in the kernel, which might require local access but not necessarily root. However, in practice, kernel vulnerabilities are often exploited by local users with some privileges, but the PR metric is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without needing root, then PR is Low. If they need root, then High.

While reading icmp sysctl variables, they can be changed concurrently. So, we need to add READ_ONCE() to avoid data-races.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. The CVE description is about a data race in the Linux kernel's icmp sysctl variables. The fix involved adding READ_ONCE() to prevent concurrent changes while reading. \n\nFirst, I need to determine each metric. Let's start with Attack Vector (AV). The vulnerability is in the kernel, which is part of the operating system. Since it's a data race, it's likely that an attacker would need to have some access to the system. But wait, data races can sometimes be exploited remotely if there's a way to trigger the race condition. However, in this case, the sysctl variables are typically accessed by processes with appropriate privileges. So maybe the attack vector is Local (L) because the attacker would need to have access to the system to exploit this. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the data race could be triggered through a network service, maybe it's Network (N). But the description doesn't mention network exposure. Hmm. I think it's more likely Local (L) because sysctl variables are usually modified by users with root or administrative privileges, not through network access.\n\nNext, Attack Complexity (AC). Data races can be complex to exploit. The attacker would need to find a way to trigger the race condition, which might require precise timing or specific conditions. So maybe High (H). But if the vulnerability is a straightforward data race that can be exploited with minimal effort once the race is triggered, maybe Low (L). I'm a bit torn here. However, data races are often considered high complexity because they require specific conditions to exploit.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR). Since the sysctl variables are modified by processes with elevated privileges, the attacker would need to have some level of access. If the vulnerability allows an attacker to escalate privileges, then PR would be Low or None. But in this case, the data race is during reading, not writing. So maybe the attacker needs to have existing privileges to exploit this. If the vulnerability is in a part of the kernel that's accessible to unprivileged users, then PR could be None. But I think sysctl variables are usually modified by users with root access. So maybe PR is High (H) because the attacker needs to have high privileges to modify the sysctl variables. Wait, but the vulnerability is in the reading of the variables. If an attacker can read the variables while they are being changed, maybe they can get inconsistent data. But that might not be a security issue unless it leads to a leak or other problem. However, the description says it's fixed by adding READ_ONCE(), which suggests that the data race could lead to incorrect data being read. But is that a security vulnerability? Maybe not. Wait, the original problem was that the variables can be changed concurrently while being read, leading to data races. But how does that translate to a security vulnerability? Maybe if the data race allows an attacker to manipulate the sysctl variables in a way that affects the system's behavior. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But the fact that it's a data race in the kernel might be a potential DoS or information leak. But the CVSS calculation is based on the vulnerability's characteristics, not the exploitability. \n\nAssuming that the vulnerability is a data race that could be exploited by an attacker with local access, then PR would be High (H) if the attacker needs to have high privileges. But if the attacker can exploit it without needing elevated privileges, then PR would be Low or None. However, since sysctl variables are typically modified by users with root access, maybe the attacker needs to have root to exploit this. So PR is High (H). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the data race is in a part of the kernel that's accessible to unprivileged users, then PR could be Low. But I think in this case, the sysctl variables are usually accessed by privileged users. So PR is High (H).\n\nUser Interaction (UI). If the exploit requires the user to perform an action, like clicking a link or opening a file, then UI is Required (R). But if the exploit can be triggered automatically without user interaction, then UI is None (N). Since the data race is in the kernel, and the exploit would require some way to trigger the race condition, which might not require user interaction. So UI is None (N).\n\nScope (S). If the vulnerability affects the same component (the kernel) that's being attacked, then S is Unchanged (U). If it affects a different component, like a different part of the system, then S is Changed (C). In this case, the vulnerability is in the kernel, so the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\nConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A). The data race could lead to incorrect data being read, which might affect confidentiality if sensitive data is being read. However, the description doesn't mention any specific impact. But since it's a data race in the kernel, it's possible that the vulnerability could lead to a denial of service (availability) if the system becomes unstable. Alternatively, if the data race allows an attacker to read or modify data in an unexpected way, that could affect confidentiality or integrity. However, without explicit information, I need to make an educated guess. Since the fix is about preventing data races, which can lead to inconsistent data, maybe the impact is on confidentiality (C: High) if the data is sensitive. But if the data race could cause the system to crash, then availability (A: High). However, the original description doesn't specify the impact. In the absence of specific information, the default for CVSS is to assume that the vulnerability has a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability if it's a critical vulnerability. But since this is a data race fix, maybe the impact is on availability. Alternatively, if the data race could be exploited to cause a DoS, then A is High. But again, without explicit info, it's hard. However, in the absence of specific details, the CVSS base score might default to High for all three if the vulnerability is considered critical. But I need to check the standard approach. Typically, if the vulnerability is a data race that could lead to a DoS, then A is High. If it's a data leak, then C is High. But since the description doesn't specify, maybe the impact is considered as High for all three. However, the original fix is about preventing data races, which might not directly lead to a security impact. Wait, but the vulnerability is in the kernel, which is a critical component. So even if the impact isn't specified, the CVSS might assume that the vulnerability has a high impact. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the vulnerability is not exploitable to cause a security impact, then the impact metrics would be None. But that's unlikely. Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, it's possible that it could be exploited to cause a DoS or other issues. So I'll go with C: High, I: High, A: High. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the data race doesn't directly lead to a security impact, then the impact metrics might be None. But that's probably not the case. The data race could lead to incorrect behavior, which might be exploited. So I think the impact metrics are all High.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.7000000000000002, "success": true}

A SQL Injection vulnerability was identified in versions prior to 3.4.6 in the endpoint `/html/atendido/Profile_Atendido.php`, in the `idatendido` parameter. This vulnerability allow an authorized attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing access to sensitive information. Version 3.4.6 fixes the issue.\n", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CVSS v3.1 base score calculation. First, I need to understand the CVE description thoroughly. The vulnerability is a SQL Injection in the WeGIA web manager, specifically in the endpoint /html/atendido/Profile_Atendido.php, affecting versions before 3.4.6. The issue is in the 'idatendido' parameter, allowing an authorized attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries and access sensitive information. The fix is in version 3.4.6.\n\nNow, I need to determine each of the base metrics. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAttack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is in a web application, and the endpoint is accessible over the network. Since it's a web parameter, an attacker doesn't need to be on the same network or physical location. So AV is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): SQL Injection typically requires crafting a specific payload. However, if the vulnerability is straightforward, like a simple injection without needing complex conditions, AC might be Low. But if it requires specific knowledge or setup, it could be High. The description says \"authorized attacker\" which might imply some level of access, but the attack itself might be low complexity. I think AC is Low (L) here.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): The attacker is described as \"authorized,\" which suggests they already have some level of access. However, the vulnerability allows them to execute arbitrary SQL queries, which might require existing privileges. Wait, but the description says \"authorized attacker\" which might mean they have legitimate access. However, in CVSS, PR is about the privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated (like having a user account), then PR would be Low. If they don't need any privileges, it's None. But the description says \"authorized,\" which might imply that the attacker is already authenticated. However, the vulnerability allows them to access sensitive information, which might require some level of access. Hmm. Wait, the vulnerability is in a parameter that's part of the URL, so maybe the attacker doesn't need any privileges beyond being able to access the endpoint. But the term \"authorized\" is a bit confusing. If the attacker is authorized, maybe they have some privileges. But in CVSS, PR is about the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker can exploit it without needing any additional privileges beyond what's already granted, then PR is None. But if they need to be authenticated, that's Low. However, the description doesn't specify whether authentication is required. The endpoint might be accessible without authentication, but the attacker is authorized, which might mean they have access. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The vulnerability allows an authorized attacker to execute SQL queries. So the attacker is already authorized, meaning they have some level of access. Therefore, the PR would be Low (L) because they need to be authenticated. But if the endpoint is accessible without authentication, then PR is None. The description doesn't mention authentication, but the term \"authorized\" might imply that the attacker is authenticated. However, in many web applications, SQL injection can be done without authentication if the endpoint is accessible. But the description says \"authorized attacker,\" which might mean that the attacker has some level of access. This is a bit tricky. Maybe I should go with PR: Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated to access the endpoint. But if the endpoint is public, then PR is None. Since the description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is in a parameter that's part of the URL, which might be accessible without authentication. However, the term \"authorized\" is confusing. Maybe the correct approach is to assume that the attacker is already authenticated, hence PR is Low. Alternatively, if the endpoint is accessible without authentication, then PR is None. Since the description doesn't clarify, but the vulnerability is in a parameter that's part of the URL, which might be accessible without authentication. Therefore, PR could be None. But the term \"authorized\" might imply that the attacker is authenticated. I think I need to make an educated guess here. Let's say PR is Low (L) because the attacker needs to be authenticated to access the endpoint. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the endpoint is public, then PR is None. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is PR: Low (L) because the attacker is authorized, implying they have some privileges. But I'm not 100% certain. Let me check the CVSS guidelines. PR is the level of privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. If the attacker needs to be authenticated, that's Low. If they don't need any, it's None. Since the description says \"authorized attacker,\" I think PR is Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): The vulnerability is in a parameter that's part of the URL. Exploiting it might require the user to interact, like clicking a link. However, if the attacker can inject the SQL without user interaction, like through a crafted URL, then UI is None. But if the user has to be tricked into clicking a link, then UI is Required. The description doesn't mention user interaction, but SQL injection in a URL parameter can be done without user interaction if the attacker can directly send the request. However, if the attacker needs to get the user to visit a malicious link, then UI is Required. Since the description doesn't specify, but the endpoint is a web parameter, I think UI is None (N) because the attacker can exploit it without requiring user interaction. For example, by sending a crafted request directly to the server.\n\nScope (S): The vulnerability affects the same component (the web application) that the attacker is interacting with. Since the attack is within the same component, the scope is Unchanged (U). If the vulnerability allowed access to a different component, it would be Changed. Here, it's within the same application, so S:U.\n\nConfidentiality (C): The vulnerability allows access to sensitive information. So C is High (H).\n\nIntegrity (I): The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary SQL queries, which could modify data. However, the description mentions access to sensitive information, not necessarily modifying it. But SQL injection can lead to data modification. However, the description doesn't explicitly mention integrity impact. If the attacker can modify data, then I is High. If it's just reading, then I is Low or None. The description says \"execute arbitrary SQL queries,\" which could include both reading and writing. But the main impact mentioned is access to sensitive information, which is confidentiality. However, the ability to execute arbitrary queries might allow modification, so I could be High. But the description doesn't specify. This is a bit ambiguous. The CVSS guidelines state that if the vulnerability allows modification of data, then I is High. Since the attacker can execute arbitrary queries, which can modify data, I would be High (H). However, if the vulnerability is only for reading, then I is Low. The description says \"execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing access to sensitive information.\" The main impact is confidentiality, but the ability to execute queries could also affect integrity. So I think I is High (H).\n\nAvailability (A): The description doesn't mention any impact on availability, like denial of service. So A is None (N).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAV: N (Network)\nAC: L (Low)\nPR: L (Low) [assuming the attacker needs to be authenticated]\nUI: N (None)\nS: U (Unchanged)\nC: H (High)\nI: H (High)\nA: N (None)\n\nWait, but earlier I was confused about PR. Let me recheck. If the attacker is authorized, does that mean they need to be authenticated? If the endpoint requires authentication, then PR is Low. If not, then PR is None. The description says \"authorized attacker,\" which might imply that the attacker has some level of access, but the vulnerability is in a parameter that's part of the URL. If the endpoint is accessible without authentication, then PR is None. However, the term \"authorized\" might mean that the attacker is authenticated. But without explicit information, it's hard to tell. However, in many cases, SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications can be exploited without authentication if the endpoint is accessible. For example, if the endpoint is a public page that doesn't require login, then PR is None. But if the endpoint is protected and requires authentication, then PR is Low. Since the description doesn't specify, but the vulnerability is in a parameter that's part of the URL, I think PR is None (N). Because the attacker can exploit it without needing any additional privileges beyond what's required to access the endpoint. If the endpoint is public, then PR is None. If it's protected, then PR is Low. But the description doesn't mention authentication, so I think PR is None (N). That would change the PR value.\n\nSo revising:\n\nPR: N (None) because the attacker doesn't need any privileges beyond accessing the endpoint, which might be public.\n\nBut the term \"authorized\" is confusing. If the attacker is authorized, they have some privileges. But the vulnerability allows them to execute SQL queries, which might be part of their authorized access. However, the CVSS PR metric is about the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability, not the privileges the attacker already has. So if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing any additional privileges (like being authenticated), then PR is None. If they need to be authenticated, then PR is Low. Since the description doesn't specify, but the endpoint is a web parameter, I think PR is None (N). Therefore, the correct PR is N.\n\nSo updating the metrics:\n\nAV: N\nAC: L\nPR: N\nUI: N\nS: U\nC: H\nI: H\nA: N", "prediction": "", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": false}
