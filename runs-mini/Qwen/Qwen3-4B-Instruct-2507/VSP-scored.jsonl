This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts through the 'kind' parameter, which is accessible over the network via HTTP requests. There is no need for physical or local access; exploitation occurs remotely over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  \nJustification: The attack can be carried out with minimal effort—only by sending a crafted request containing malicious script content. No complex conditions or technical barriers exist, making the exploit straightforward once the vulnerability is known.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: While the attacker needs Contributor-level access or higher to exploit this vulnerability, Contributor-level access is not considered high privilege in WordPress contexts. It is a common role that many users have, and the requirement is relatively low compared to admin-level privileges. Thus, PR is classified as Low.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The victim must visit a page that contains the injected script for the XSS payload to execute. The attacker cannot directly perform actions on the user’s browser; the user must interact with the application (e.g., view a page) for the script to run. Therefore, user interaction is required.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the behavior of the application's output when rendering certain pages. Since the injection leads to execution across multiple pages, the impact extends beyond the original input point, affecting other parts of the application. This indicates scope change from the initial component to broader functionality.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not allow unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data such as passwords or personal information. The primary effect is script execution, not exposure of confidential data.\n\nIntegrity (I): Low (L)  \nJustification: An attacker could potentially modify content displayed to users via injected scripts, but they do not alter backend data or system files. The integrity of stored data remains intact; only frontend presentation is affected. Hence, Integrity impact is Low.\n\nAvailability (A): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not cause denial-of-service or disruption of service.

This issue affects Change Add to Cart Button Text for WooCommerce: from n/a through 2.2.2.\n", "response": "The CVE describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the \"Change Add to Cart Button Text for WooCommerce\" plugin, specifically a **Stored XSS** flaw. This means that an attacker can inject malicious scripts into content that is then served to other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or data theft.\n\nLet’s analyze each base metric based on standard CVSS v3.1 guidelines and the nature of this vulnerability:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**:  \nThe vulnerability occurs during web page generation via user input in a WordPress plugin. Attackers exploit this over the network by injecting script into a user-facing form or content field. Since the attack happens via the web interface accessible over the internet, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.\n\n→ **AV: N**\n\n---\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**:  \nThe vulnerability requires no complex conditions — simply injecting a script into a user input field (e.g., product button text) and storing it. Once stored, the script executes when other users view the page. No special configuration or interaction beyond basic input is needed. Thus, the complexity is low.\n\n→ **AC: L**\n\n---\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**:  \nTo exploit this, an attacker does not need to be authenticated. They can submit malicious input directly through a public form or admin panel if they have access to the site's frontend. However, since the input is stored and executed on the server side, the attacker needs to be able to reach the site and submit content — which typically requires some level of access (like being a registered user or having write permissions). But in the case of stored XSS, attackers often don't require authentication to trigger the vulnerability if they can manipulate publicly visible fields. Still, in many cases, such vulnerabilities require the attacker to be able to post content, which may imply some level of privilege. However, in typical stored XSS scenarios where the input is rendered without sanitization, **no specific privileges** are required beyond normal user access. In practice, such flaws are considered exploitable by unauthenticated attackers who can inject payloads into forms.\n\nThus, **Privileges Required = None (N)**.\n\n→ **PR: N**\n\n---\n\n**User Interaction (UI)**:  \nFor stored XSS, once the payload is injected and saved, it will execute automatically when another user visits the affected page. There is no need for the victim to take any action — just visiting the page triggers execution. Therefore, **user interaction is not required**.\n\n→ **UI: N**\n\n---\n\n**Scope (S)**:  \nThis vulnerability affects a single component (a WooCommerce plugin feature). The impact is limited to the web interface and user sessions; there is no indication that the system's internal state or core functionality is altered. The scope remains unchanged.\n\n→ **S: U**\n\n---\n\n**Confidentiality (C)**:  \nAn attacker can steal sensitive information like cookies, session tokens, or personal data from victims' browsers. This enables session hijacking or credential theft. This constitutes a high-level confidentiality breach.\n\n→ **C: H**\n\n---\n\n**Integrity (I)**:  \nThere is no evidence that the attacker can modify or delete data or alter the application's behavior beyond what is already possible via XSS. Data integrity is not compromised — only user data or session data might be stolen. So, integrity is not significantly impacted.\n\n→ **I: N**\n\n---\n\n**Availability (A)**:  \nNo denial-of-service or disruption of service is mentioned. The vulnerability does not affect system availability.\n\n→ **A: N**\n\n---\n\nFinal CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Summary:\n- AV: N  \n- AC: L  \n- PR: N  \n- UI: N  \n- S: U  \n- C: H  \n- I: N  \n- A: N  \n\nNow, constructing the full vector string:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.0999999999999996, "success": true}

This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `id` parameter. Version 3.4.5 fixes the issue.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists in a publicly accessible web endpoint (`personalizacao_selecao.php`). An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious URL that is sent over the network, making the attack vector remote and over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  \nJustification: The XSS vulnerability is reflected — the attacker simply needs to embed malicious script content into a URL parameter (the `id` field).

There's no indication that the compromise expands beyond the application’s functionality.\n\nConfidentiality (C): Low (L)  \nJustification: The primary impact is that user input is reflected back in the browser, potentially allowing attackers to steal session cookies or other sensitive data from users' browsers. However, the confidentiality breach is limited to what is visible in the client-side context — not full data exfiltration or system-level secrets. Thus, low impact on confidentiality.\n\nIntegrity (I): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not allow modification of data or system settings.

This is to prevent a possible integer underflow that might happen when copying the source scatterlist into a linear buffer.\n", "response": "The CVE describes a fix in the Linux kernel's cryptographic module (qat) related to an integer underflow when handling RSA reject requests with a source buffer larger than the key size. The issue arises during data copying from a scatterlist to a linear buffer, where improper bounds checking could lead to memory corruption due to an integer underflow.\n\nLet’s analyze each base metric based on the nature of this vulnerability:\n\n- **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability exists in a kernel component exposed to network traffic via cryptographic operations (e.g., TLS, IPsec). An attacker could exploit this through network-based interactions involving encrypted traffic. Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.\n\n- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability involves a failure in parameter validation (buffer size vs. key size), which can be triggered by sending malformed or oversized buffers. This requires minimal manipulation—just crafting a request with a large buffer—and does not require complex conditions or interaction. Thus, the complexity is **Low (L)**.\n\n- **Privileges Required (PR)**: To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send maliciously crafted packets to the system, likely requiring access to the network stack. In most cases, such attacks do not require elevated privileges; they can be initiated by a remote user. Hence, **None (N)**.\n\n- **User Interaction (UI)**: No user action is required to trigger the vulnerability. It is exploitable automatically via network input. So, **None (N)**.\n\n- **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects a specific subsystem (crypto/qat) within the kernel. There is no indication that the flaw leads to broader system compromise or changes in behavior across other components. The impact remains confined to the cryptographic processing path. Therefore, **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n- **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability stems from a potential integer underflow leading to memory corruption. While the direct confidentiality loss isn't evident, memory corruption may allow attackers to read sensitive data if exploited further. However, the primary risk is integrity and availability. Based on standard interpretation, memory corruption typically doesn’t directly expose secrets unless combined with other flaws. Thus, **Low (L)** — limited confidentiality exposure.\n\n- **Integrity (I)**: Memory corruption caused by integer underflow can result in arbitrary writes to memory, potentially allowing modification of critical data structures. This poses a significant threat to data integrity. Therefore, **High (H)**.\n\n- **Availability (A)**: If memory corruption occurs, it could crash the kernel or cause denial-of-service. Since the vulnerability is in a core crypto driver, a successful exploitation could lead to system instability or crashes. This results in **High (H)** availability impact.\n\nFinal CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Summary:\n- AV: N  \n- AC: L  \n- PR: N  \n- UI: N  \n- S: U  \n- C: L  \n- I: H  \n- A: H  \n\nCVSS v3.1 Vector String:\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 3.9000000000000004, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts through user-supplied input that is rendered in web pages accessible over the network. The attack does not require physical access or direct system interaction; it exploits a web-based interface exposed to users over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the exploit targets a specific input field, successful exploitation requires the attacker to craft and submit malicious script content that survives sanitization and is then executed when viewed by other users. This involves precise manipulation of inputs and depends on the target user visiting the affected page — making it non-trivial and requiring careful crafting, thus indicating high complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability can be exploited by attackers with contributor-level access or higher within WordPress. Contributor-level access is considered a relatively low privilege level compared to administrator privileges, but still sufficient to modify content and potentially trigger the injection. However, since the attack relies on user input being processed and rendered, and no deeper system access is required, this falls under low privileges.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The malicious script is stored and executed when a user visits the affected page. Therefore, the victim must actively view the page containing the injected script for the payload to run. User interaction is necessary for the attack to succeed.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects how user-supplied data is handled in the frontend rendering process. Since the malicious script is executed in the context of a user’s browser upon viewing a page, the impact extends beyond the original component to affect the entire user experience and potentially other pages where the same content is displayed. This indicates scope change from the initial component to broader application behavior.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: There is no indication that sensitive data such as passwords, personal information, or private keys are disclosed. The attack focuses on executing scripts, which may lead to session hijacking or phishing, but the primary effect is not unauthorized disclosure of confidential data.\n\nIntegrity (I): Low (L)  \nJustification: The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts into content, which could alter the behavior of a page or redirect users. While this doesn't directly corrupt data files or databases, it can manipulate the presentation or flow of content, leading to integrity compromise. However, no direct modification of stored data is implied, so it remains at a lower severity than high integrity impact.\n\nAvailability (A): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not cause denial-of-service, crashes, or resource exhaustion.

Prior to version 25.4.0, the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently, conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization, which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result, the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions, conda-build creates a potential execution pathway for malicious code, violating security assumptions. This issue has been patched in version 25.4.0.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability arises from the use of `eval()` on user-provided input within meta.yaml files, which are part of the package configuration. These files are typically managed by users or developers and can be uploaded or modified remotely. While the direct attack path does not require network access to execute the exploit (e.g., no remote server exploitation), the attacker could craft a malicious meta.yaml file that is then processed during a build operation—this build process can occur over a networked system or via CI/CD pipelines. However, since the vulnerability is triggered through user-controlled input being evaluated in a local build context, and there's no indication of external network-based exploitation (like a web request), the most accurate vector is **Local** (L). But note: the input comes from a user-supplied config file, which is read locally during build. Since the attacker needs to have access to modify the recipe (i.e., upload a malicious meta.yaml), this requires some form of local access to the build environment. Therefore, the correct vector is **Local (L)** — because the attacker must gain access to the build system to inject the malicious recipe.\n\nHowever, reconsidering: the vulnerability exists in a tool used in software builds where users submit recipes. If an attacker can influence the recipe (e.g., via a public repository or shared build environment), they might trigger the flaw. But the actual execution happens when the recipe is parsed and built — this occurs in a local build environment. There’s no evidence of remote code execution via network traffic; instead, the input is provided via a file. Thus, the attack vector is best classified as **Local (L)**.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: Exploiting this vulnerability requires careful crafting of a malicious expression in the meta.yaml file to trigger the `eval()` call. The attacker must understand the syntax of the selector language and how it maps to Python expressions. Additionally, the build process must be configured to accept and evaluate such inputs. This level of knowledge and precision makes the attack complex. It is not trivial to create a valid, exploitable selector that results in arbitrary code execution. Hence, Attack Complexity is **High (H)**.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability lies in the unsafe use of `eval()` on user-provided input. An attacker does not need elevated privileges to create a malicious meta.yaml file. They only need write access to the recipe directory or a build configuration where such files are accepted. In many cases, users or contributors can upload recipes to public repositories or shared environments. Once the file is submitted, the build system processes it. No administrative rights are required to exploit this — just the ability to modify a recipe. So, **None (N)** is appropriate.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The attacker must provide a malicious meta.yaml file that includes a crafted selector expression. This requires interaction with the build system — either manually uploading the file or triggering a build job with that recipe. The user (or developer) must initiate the build process with the malicious recipe. Therefore, **User Interaction (R)** is required to trigger the vulnerability.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the build environment's integrity and allows arbitrary code execution during package building. The impact extends beyond the immediate scope of the conda-build component — it compromises the entire build process, potentially allowing unauthorized modifications to files, installation of malicious components, or manipulation of dependencies. This leads to changes in the system state (e.g., files created, commands executed), affecting other parts of the build environment. Thus, the scope is **Changed (C)**.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not allow disclosure of sensitive data. The issue involves executing arbitrary code, but not reading or exposing private information. There is no mention of data leakage or exposure of secrets. Therefore, confidentiality is unaffected — **None (N)**.\n\nIntegrity (I): High (H)  \nJustification: The core problem is that arbitrary code can be executed during the build process. This means that malicious commands can be run, such as modifying files, deleting content, or installing backdoors. This directly undermines the integrity of the build environment and resulting packages. Unauthorized changes to the build process or output are possible. Thus, **High (H)**.\n\nAvailability (A): High (H)  \nJustification: While availability isn't directly threatened (the system doesn’t crash), the execution of arbitrary code could lead to denial-of-service scenarios if the malicious command causes crashes, infinite loops, or resource exhaustion. More importantly, if the build process fails or corrupts itself, it could prevent legitimate builds from completing. Also, if the attacker gains control over the build environment, they could disrupt normal operations.

Then we pass the result to uverbs_request_next_ptr() which also could potentially wrap. The \"cmd.sge_count * sizeof(struct ib_uverbs_sge)\" multiplication can also overflow on 32bit systems although it's fine on 64bit systems. This patch does two things. First, I've re-arranged the condition in uverbs_request_next_ptr() so that the use controlled variable \"len\" is on one side of the comparison by itself without any math. Then I've modified all the callers to use size_mul() for the multiplications.\n", "response": "The CVE describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel’s RDMA/uverbs subsystem related to potential integer overflow in arithmetic expressions involving user-provided values (e.g., `cmd.wqe_size * cmd.wr_count` and `cmd.sge_count * sizeof(struct ib_uverbs_sge)`). The vulnerability arises due to unchecked multiplication of user-supplied 32-bit integers, which may cause integer wrapping (overflow) on 32-bit systems — leading to incorrect memory calculations or potential out-of-bounds access if not properly validated.\n\nHowever, the fix described involves preventing overflow by using a safe multiplication function (`size_mul`) and restructuring conditions to avoid intermediate overflows. This indicates that the vulnerability is primarily a **buffer overflow risk due to integer underflow/overflow**, but the actual exploit path depends on whether an attacker can trigger invalid memory accesses via crafted inputs.\n\nLet’s analyze each CVSS v3.1 base metric based on the nature of this vulnerability:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**:  \nThe vulnerability exists in a system-level component (RDMA/uverbs) exposed through user-space interfaces (uverbs). Attackers can send malformed commands via user-space applications or networked clients. Since the input comes from users and is processed in kernel space, the attack vector is **Network (N)** — because the interface is accessible over the network (via RDMA-based communication).  \n→ **AV: N**\n\n---\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**:  \nThe vulnerability stems from unbounded arithmetic operations with user-controlled inputs. An attacker needs to craft specific values to trigger overflow, which requires some knowledge of the structure and bounds. However, since the overflow is predictable and exploitable with simple manipulation (e.g., large values), no complex interaction or deep understanding is required.  \nThis qualifies as **Low complexity** — the attacker can trigger the issue with relatively straightforward input.  \n→ **AC: L**\n\n---\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**:  \nTo interact with RDMA/uverbs, an attacker would typically need to have elevated privileges (such as root or kernel-level access) or be part of a privileged process. However, in many cases, such interfaces are accessed via user-space tools that require proper permissions. But crucially, the vulnerability is triggered by user-controlled data passed into kernel functions — meaning an attacker with **normal user privileges** could potentially submit malicious input.  \nThere is no indication that the exploit requires administrative rights beyond normal access to the system. Therefore, **no special privilege escalation is needed**.  \n→ **PR: N**\n\n---\n\n**User Interaction (UI)**:  \nThe vulnerability is triggered by sending malformed commands (e.g., large values in wqe_size, wr_count, sge_count). These are sent directly during operation — no interactive session or prompt is required. The exploit is fully automated via input injection.  \n→ **UI: N**\n\n---\n\n**Scope (S)**:  \nThe vulnerability affects only the RDMA/uverbs subsystem within the kernel. There is no evidence that the flaw leads to broader system compromise or changes in behavior across other components. The impact remains confined to the affected module.  \n→ **S: U**\n\n---\n\n**Confidentiality (C)**:  \nNo data leakage is mentioned. The issue is about arithmetic overflow, which may lead to crashes or memory corruption, but there is no indication that sensitive data is read or disclosed.  \n→ **C: N**\n\n---\n\n**Integrity (I)**:  \nInteger overflow can lead to incorrect memory calculations, possibly resulting in buffer overruns or corrupted kernel structures. If exploited, this could allow an attacker to modify memory contents or manipulate internal state — thus affecting integrity. While not explicitly stated, such overflows are often used to achieve integrity violations (e.g., writing to unintended locations).  \nGiven the potential for memory corruption, this is a **high-integrity impact**.  \n→ **I: H**\n\n---\n\n**Availability (A)**:  \nIf the overflow causes a crash or denial of service (e.g., kernel panic or hang), availability is impacted. Although not explicitly stated, integer overflows in kernel code frequently lead to crashes. The patch aims to prevent such issues, implying the original flaw could cause instability.  \nThus, **availability is at high risk**.  \n→ **A: H**\n\n---\n\nFinal CVSS v3.1 Base Vector:\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 3.5999999999999996, "success": true}

Ensure platform_set_drvdata() is called before devm_pm_runtime_enable().\n", "response": "The provided CVE description describes a bug in the Linux kernel's phy driver for Rockchip platforms, specifically related to improper timing of `platform_set_drvdata()` being called before `devm_pm_runtime_enable()` is invoked. This results in a NULL pointer dereference when `dev_get_drvdata()` is called during runtime resume.\n\nLet’s analyze the key aspects of this vulnerability:\n\n- **Attack Vector**: The vulnerability arises from incorrect initialization order within the kernel driver code. It does not require external input or network access; it stems from an internal logic flaw in how device drivers manage runtime power management. However, exploitation would require a system-level context where the driver is loaded and triggered — which is inherently part of normal kernel operation. Since no remote attacker can trigger this directly via network or user-space interaction, but rather through kernel execution path (e.g., device probing/resume), the attack vector is best classified as **Network (N)** because the exploit could theoretically be triggered by a maliciously crafted kernel module or firmware update that manipulates the probe sequence. But more accurately, since the issue occurs due to a missing call in the driver lifecycle and requires kernel-level access, it is not exploitable remotely. However, in standard CVSS evaluation, such kernel memory corruption via null dereference typically falls under **Local (L)** if the attacker needs local access to the system (e.g., root shell). Given that the flaw exists in kernel code and requires the driver to be loaded and executed, and cannot be triggered remotely, the correct AV is **Local (L)**.\n\n- **Attack Complexity**: The vulnerability is a race condition between two function calls (`platform_set_drvdata` and `devm_pm_runtime_enable`). The timing depends on the order of execution during probe phase. This is a deterministic flaw in the driver flow — not requiring complex manipulation or side-channel attacks. Therefore, the complexity is **Low (L)**.\n\n- **Privileges Required**: To trigger this vulnerability, one must have access to load or modify kernel modules (i.e., kernel-level privileges). This means the attacker must already be running with elevated privileges (root or kernel-level access). Thus, **High (H)** privileges are required.\n\n- **User Interaction**: No user action is needed — the failure happens automatically during device probe or runtime resume. There is no need for user input. So, **None (N)**.\n\n- **Scope**: The vulnerability affects only the specific phy driver component.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts through user-supplied input that is rendered in web pages accessible over the network. The attack does not require physical access or direct local interaction; it exploits a network-facing component (the frontend page rendering).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the exploit targets a specific input field, successful exploitation requires the attacker to craft and submit malicious content that is then stored and executed when users view affected pages. This involves precise input manipulation and depends on the target user accessing the compromised page—making it non-trivial and requiring careful crafting, thus indicating high complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated attackers with author-level access or higher. Author-level access is considered a relatively low privilege level within WordPress, especially compared to administrator privileges. However, since the attacker needs to be logged in and have at least author rights, this falls under \"Low\" rather than \"None\", because full access isn't required but some authentication is needed.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The malicious script is stored and executes only when a victim visits the affected page.

Under certain conditions, an attacker could potentially trick users into unintentionally authorizing sensitive actions on their behalf.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows an attacker to trick users into authorizing sensitive actions, which implies remote interaction via social engineering or phishing. This is a network-based attack where the attacker does not need physical access or local compromise—only network exposure to initiate the deception.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: The exploit requires specific conditions under which users are tricked into authorizing actions. These conditions involve user manipulation (e.g., convincing them to click a malicious link or confirm a suspicious action), indicating that the attack is not trivial or automatic—it relies on complex user behavior and precise timing, making it high in complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not require the attacker to have existing privileges on the system. It exploits human trust and behavior rather than exploiting technical weaknesses in authentication or authorization mechanisms. An unauthenticated attacker can trigger the scenario by deceiving a user.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The vulnerability depends on users being tricked into performing a specific action (e.g., confirming a sensitive operation). Without active user input, the attack cannot proceed. Therefore, user interaction is required.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the application's functionality related to user authorization but does not indicate that the impact extends beyond the original scope of the affected component (e.g., no lateral movement or data leakage across unrelated systems). Thus, the scope remains unchanged.\n\nConfidentiality (C): Low (L)  \nJustification: While sensitive actions may be authorized, the primary risk is not unauthorized disclosure of confidential data. The issue centers around misdirection during authorization, not direct exposure of private information. Hence, confidentiality impact is limited.\n\nIntegrity (I): High (H)  \nJustification: If a user unknowingly authorizes a sensitive action (such as deleting a repository or changing permissions), this directly compromises the integrity of the system’s data and configuration.

The app does not encrypt the GID in messages.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows an attacker to access the GID (phone number) through unencrypted message traffic that is transmitted over the network. Since the data is sent over the network and accessible by anyone intercepting the communication, the attack vector is network-based.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability involves a failure to encrypt a sensitive identifier (GID = phone number). This means that once an attacker gains access to the network traffic, they can directly read the unencrypted phone number without needing complex techniques or additional exploitation steps. No sophisticated interaction or system manipulation is required.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: An attacker does not need any special privileges or authentication to observe or intercept messages.

Specifically, due to a missing check after receiving an IPC response, an attacker may receive a message with an incorrect type, leading to access to unintended memory regions — this constitutes a potential memory corruption issue that could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or possibly lead to code execution if exploited further.\n\nLet’s analyze each CVSS v3.1 base metric based on the nature of the vulnerability:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**: **Network (N)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists in the ksmbd module, which handles SMB protocol communication over the network. An attacker would need to send maliciously crafted requests through the network (e.g., via SMB traffic) to trigger the race condition and exploit the type confusion. This makes the attack vector remote and network-based.\n\n---\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: **High (H)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability involves a race condition where timing and synchronization between message allocation and processing are critical. Exploiting the type confusion requires precise timing and coordination between multiple system calls (like ipc_msg_send_request and FSCTL_PIPE_TRANSCEIVE). This complexity increases the difficulty of exploitation, making it high.\n\n---\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**: **None (N)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability arises in a public interface (IPC messaging) used by clients connecting to the server. There's no indication that root or elevated privileges are required to trigger the flaw.

As a result, rtllib_beacons_stop() will block forever. This patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of spin_lock_irqsave(), which could let timer handler to obtain the needed lock.\n", "response": "The CVE describes a deadlock issue in the `rtllib_beacons_stop()` function within the Linux kernel's wireless driver (`rtl8192e`). The problem arises due to improper locking order — two threads attempt to acquire the same spinlock (`ieee->beacon_lock`) at different times, leading to a potential deadlock where one thread waits indefinitely for the other to release the lock.\n\nLet’s analyze each CVSS v3.1 base metric based on the nature of this vulnerability:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**: **Network (N)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists in a kernel driver component that handles network interface operations (specifically beacon frames in Wi-Fi). An attacker would need to exploit this through a network-based interaction (e.g., via a maliciously crafted packet or system call), making it accessible over a network. While the vulnerability is internal to the kernel, exploitation typically requires access to the system (e.g., via local privilege escalation or network injection), so the attack vector is network-level in practice.\n\n> Note: Although the flaw is in kernel code, the actual exploitation path involves triggering a specific behavior during normal network operation (beacon sending/stopping), which can be initiated remotely by an attacker who controls the network traffic. Thus, AV = N.\n\n---\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: **High (H)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability results in a deadlock under specific timing conditions. The attacker cannot guarantee when the timer will fire or when both threads will reach their respective lock points. Exploitation requires precise coordination between the beacon send and stop processes, which may not occur predictably. Additionally, the deadlock condition depends on race conditions and timing, meaning successful exploitation is non-trivial and requires careful orchestration. Therefore, attack complexity is high.\n\n---\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**: **High (H)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability resides in the kernel driver and affects low-level networking functions. To trigger the issue, an attacker must have sufficient privileges to manipulate the wireless driver (e.g., via root access or kernel module loading). Without elevated privileges, such control over the driver state is not possible. Hence, high privileges are required.\n\n---\n\n**User Interaction (UI)**: **Required (R)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability manifests during normal operation of the wireless interface (sending/beaconing). It does not allow arbitrary execution or immediate compromise; rather, it requires user action (such as initiating a beacon stop command or connecting to a network) to trigger the sequence of events that", "prediction": "X", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

Starting in version 2.10.0 and prior to version 2.10.2, a specially crafted document could cause an out of bound read, most likely resulting in a crash. Versions prior to 2.10.0 are not vulnerable. Version 2.10.2 fixes the problem. No known workarounds are available.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability arises from a specially crafted JSON document being processed by the Ruby implementation. Such input can be delivered over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests), making the attack vector remote and accessible over the network. There's no indication that the exploit requires local file access or physical interaction.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  \nJustification: The issue involves an out-of-bounds read triggered by a specially crafted document. This suggests that the vulnerability can be exploited with minimal effort—only a specific, well-formed input is needed. No complex conditions or manipulation are required, indicating low attack complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not require elevated privileges to trigger. An unauthenticated attacker can send a maliciously constructed JSON payload to trigger the out-of-bounds read, leading to a potential crash. No authentication or user-level permissions are necessary.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows exploitation through automated delivery of a crafted document (e.g., via API request). It does not require any action from the end-user such as clicking a link or opening a file. Thus, user interaction is not required.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects only the JSON parser component and results in a crash or memory read error within that module. There is no evidence that the behavior extends into other parts of the system or changes the overall functionality beyond the immediate scope of the parser. Therefore, the scope remains unchanged.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: The issue leads to an out-of-bounds read, which may expose internal memory contents—but this is not explicitly described as leaking sensitive data. The primary impact is a crash, not unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Without explicit mention of data exposure, confidentiality impact is considered none.\n\nIntegrity (I): None (N)  \nJustification: There is no indication that the vulnerability allows modification of data or system state. The effect is limited to a crash or possible memory corruption, but no alteration of stored or processed data is mentioned. Hence, integrity is unaffected.\n\nAvailability (A): High (H)  \nJustification: The vulnerability causes an out-of-bounds read that “most likely results in a crash.” A crash in a critical component like a JSON parser can lead to denial of service, preventing normal operation of applications relying on JSON parsing.

A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability during installation, leading to arbitrary folder or file deletion.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Local (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability is exploitable during installation by a local malicious user, meaning the attacker must be on the same system. This indicates an attack vector that does not require network access or physical presence—only local access to the system.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: The vulnerability involves a race condition, which typically requires precise timing and coordination between processes. Exploiting such conditions often demands careful manipulation of execution order, making it complex and not trivially exploitable under normal circumstances.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: While the attacker needs to be local, the vulnerability allows exploitation during installation, which may not require elevated privileges beyond standard user rights. Installation contexts can sometimes allow lower-privilege users to trigger race conditions if they have sufficient control over the process flow.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The vulnerability is triggered during installation, which implies that the user must initiate or participate in the process (e.g., running the installer). Without user interaction, the race condition would not be activated. Therefore, user action is required.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: Race conditions affecting file or folder deletion indicate that the impact extends beyond the original component (Display Manager) into other parts of the system (file system).

It may have been possible for private repository to be cloned in case of race condition when a secondary node is out of sync.\n", "response": "The CVE describes a race condition vulnerability in GitLab EE that could allow an attacker to clone a private repository if a secondary node is out of sync. This implies that the vulnerability arises due to a timing-based inconsistency during replication between nodes, which can be exploited under certain conditions involving network availability and system synchronization.\n\nLet’s analyze each base metric based on the described behavior:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**:  \n   - The vulnerability occurs in a distributed environment where nodes are synchronized. An attacker would need to exploit this through network access to trigger the race condition.  \n   - Since the attack requires interaction over the network (e.g., cloning via HTTP), the attack vector is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**:  \n   - The vulnerability involves a race condition — a timing-based flaw. Exploiting such a condition typically requires precise timing and coordination, which increases complexity.  \n   - However, if the race condition is predictable or exploitable under normal operations (e.g., due to misconfiguration or lack of synchronization), it may not require high skill. Still, in practice, such race conditions often require some level of control over timing.  \n   - Given that the exploit depends on a specific sequence of events (node desync), it is not trivial but does not require deep technical knowledge beyond understanding the system's operation.  \n   - Therefore, we assign **High (H)** — because successful exploitation likely requires careful timing and environmental conditions.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**:  \n   - The vulnerability allows cloning of a *private* repository. To do so, the attacker would need to either authenticate or gain access to the GitLab instance.  \n   - Cloning a private repo generally requires authentication, meaning the attacker needs valid credentials.  \n   - Thus, **Low (L)** privileges are required (i.e., user-level access, not administrative).  \n   - Note: If the attacker were already authenticated, they might exploit this; however, the vulnerability itself doesn't grant unauthorized access directly. Authentication is still needed.  \n   - So, **Low (L)** is appropriate.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**:  \n   - The attacker does not need to interact with the user (e.g., click a button) to exploit the race condition. The race condition can be triggered automatically by system behavior or network inconsistencies.  \n   - The exploit is automated and does not require human input.  \n   - Hence, **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (", "prediction": "X", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts through publicly accessible pages via a shortcode. Since the attack occurs over the network and does not require physical access or direct system interaction, the attack vector is Network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the exploit targets a known input field, successful exploitation requires the attacker to craft and submit malicious content that is then stored and executed when users visit affected pages. This involves precise manipulation of inputs and relies on the target user visiting the compromised page—making it complex to exploit successfully compared to trivial cases.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability can be exploited by attackers with contributor-level access or higher. Contributor-level access is considered a relatively low privilege level within WordPress roles, so this qualifies as Low Privileges Required.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The malicious script is only executed when a user visits a page containing the injected shortcode. Therefore, user interaction is required for the attack to succeed—this is a key aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the behavior of the plugin’s output, allowing execution of scripts across different parts of the site. The impact extends beyond the original component (the shortcode), affecting other pages where the shortcode appears. Thus, the scope changes from the initial component to broader application areas.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: There is no indication that sensitive data such as passwords or personal information is exposed. The issue is about executing scripts, which primarily affects functionality rather than confidentiality.\n\nIntegrity (I): Low (L)  \nJustification: While the script injection alters the content displayed to users, it does not directly modify or corrupt underlying data structures or files.

Attackers can exploit this over the network by crafting malicious content that is rendered when users visit affected pages. There is no need for physical access or direct local interaction.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the attack is technically feasible, successful exploitation requires the attacker to first gain contributor-level access to the WordPress site—this implies they must authenticate and potentially navigate the site’s administrative interface. Additionally, the attacker must craft and submit malicious input that survives sanitization, which involves careful manipulation of inputs. This level of coordination and precision indicates high complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows execution by contributors (a role typically requiring less privilege than administrators). Contributor-level access is not the highest privilege but is still sufficient to modify content and inject scripts into pages. Thus, while not \"none,\" it is below administrator-level privileges, placing it in the low range.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The victim must open a page containing the malicious shortcode for the script to execute.

In CVSS v3.1, \"Authenticated\" is typically mapped to \"Low\" if the user needs minimal privileges (e.g., standard user). Since the vulnerability requires authentication but no elevated privileges beyond normal user access, we assign PR = Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability causes a denial of service through improper input handling. Once authenticated, the attacker can trigger the flaw without requiring additional interaction from the user (e.g., clicking a link or entering data manually). Hence, user interaction is not required.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U)  \nJustification: The impact is limited to the Kubernetes integration component within GitLab. There's no indication that the vulnerability affects other parts of the system or expands its scope. Therefore, the scope remains unchanged.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: The issue results in a denial of service, not unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. No data leakage or exposure is mentioned, so confidentiality is unaffected.\n\nIntegrity (I): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not allow modification or corruption of data. It only leads to service disruption, so integrity is not impacted.\n\nAvailability (A): High (H)  \nJustification: Denial of service directly impacts availability—the service becomes unavailable to users during exploitation.

The vulnerability arises from improper sanitization of HTML tags in chat history uploads. Specifically, the sanitization logic fails to handle HTML tags within code blocks correctly, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to identity theft or other malicious actions.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability is exploitable via a web interface where users upload chat history. An attacker can send a malicious payload over the network to a remote server, which then renders the script in the victim’s browser. No physical access or local interaction is required; the attack occurs over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the XSS payload may appear simple, successful exploitation requires precise crafting of HTML content that includes malicious scripts inside code blocks—specifically, exploiting a flaw in how HTML tags are sanitized. The attacker must understand the structure of the input and ensure the payload bypasses sanitization, which involves careful manipulation and knowledge of the target system’s parsing behavior. This level of precision makes the attack complex.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject malicious scripts through normal user input (chat history upload). No authentication or elevated privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The victim must open the chat interface and view the malicious content for the script to execute. The XSS payload is rendered in the browser when the page loads the chat history, so the user must interact with the application to be affected.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the user session and browser context by executing arbitrary JavaScript. The impact extends beyond just the chat history display—it can compromise user data such as login tokens or session cookies, thus altering the scope of the affected system components.\n\nConfidentiality (C): High (H)  \nJustification: Malicious scripts can steal sensitive information like session tokens, cookies, or personal data displayed on the page during chat interactions. This directly compromises user confidentiality.\n\nIntegrity (I): High (H)  \nJustification: Since the injected script can modify the DOM or perform actions like redirecting or stealing credentials, it enables unauthorized changes to user data or session state.

Attackers need only send malformed packets over the network to trigger the crash. This makes the attack vector clearly network-based.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the vulnerability involves a null pointer dereference due to a missing required field, exploiting it requires crafting a specific malformed packet that lacks the ENB_UE_S1AP_ID field.

It addresses a potential NULL pointer dereference during debugging output (`dpu_plane_atomic_print_state()`), by adding a validation check on `pipe->sspp` before printing its state. This ensures that the function does not crash due to accessing an uninitialized or null pointer when dumping pipe state without prior atomic check.\n\nLet’s analyze the base metrics based on the nature of this vulnerability:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**: Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), Physical (P)  \n- The issue arises during debug logging in kernel code — it is internal to the kernel driver stack and affects system behavior under specific conditions (e.g., dumping state).  \n- An attacker would need direct access to the kernel module or system to trigger such a condition, which typically requires local privilege or kernel-level access.  \n- However, since the vulnerability is triggered during a print operation (debugging), and no remote exploitation path exists, and the flaw is purely defensive (preventing crashes via input validation), it cannot be exploited remotely.  \n- There is no indication of network exposure or user-space interaction.  \n→ **Choice: Local (L)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability occurs within kernel memory management during a debug print and requires execution in kernel context, likely via a local process or kernel module. Remote attackers cannot exploit this directly; thus, attack vector is Local.\n\n---\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: Low (L), High (H)  \n- The bug manifests when calling `dpu_plane_atomic_print_state()` without a prior `atomic_check()`, meaning the state is accessed without proper initialization.  \n- This scenario can occur under normal kernel operation if a debugging dump happens prematurely.  \n- The condition is deterministic and easily reproducible in controlled environments (e.g., kernel logs, debugging tools).  \n- No complex setup or side-channel attacks are required.  \n→ **Choice: Low (L)**  \nJustification: Exploitation requires minimal effort—only correct timing or triggering of a debug print without atomic check.

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JP2 files.The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25564.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows remote attackers to exploit it by sending a malicious JP2 file via a web request or by having the user visit a malicious page. Since the attack originates from a remote source over the network, the attack vector is Network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: Exploitation requires the victim to open a malicious file or visit a malicious webpage — which implies that the attacker must craft a carefully constructed payload. Additionally, the vulnerability involves improper validation of object existence, meaning the exploitation relies on precise conditions and timing, increasing complexity. While not fully automatic, the need for a crafted input and user action makes the attack complex.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: There is no mention of requiring administrative privileges or elevated access. The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users who simply open a malicious file or navigate to a malicious URL. Thus, no special privileges are needed.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The CVE explicitly states “User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability” — the user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page. This clearly indicates that user action is necessary, so UI is set to Required.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process, which suggests that the impact extends beyond the original application scope into system-level behavior. This indicates a change in the scope of the affected component, such as allowing privilege escalation or broader system access, thus qualifying as Scope Changed.\n\nConfidentiality (C): High (H)  \nJustification: The vulnerability results in information disclosure — specifically, sensitive information about the installation is exposed. This directly impacts confidentiality, and since the data disclosed could include internal configuration or credentials, the impact is high.\n\nIntegrity (I): High (H)  \nJustification: Although the primary effect is information disclosure, the CVE notes that the vulnerability can be leveraged in conjunction with other flaws to execute arbitrary code. Arbitrary code execution inherently compromises integrity by allowing unauthorized modifications to system state or data. Therefore, integrity is considered High due to potential for unauthorized changes.\n\nAvailability (A): High (H)  \nJustification: While the immediate effect is information disclosure, the fact that the vulnerability can be used to execute arbitrary code means it may lead to denial-of-service or system compromise.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Note: Since the widget code isn't part of the code base, to apply the patch, the affected widget: Transparent Split Hero must be deleted and reinstalled manually.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts through user-supplied attributes in a publicly accessible widget within a WordPress site. The attack occurs over the network when users visit affected pages, making the attack vector network-based.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the injection point exists directly in user input, successful exploitation requires the attacker to craft and submit malicious content that is then rendered in a way that executes upon user interaction. The victim must view the compromised page, and the script execution depends on proper rendering context—this implies non-trivial conditions and careful crafting, indicating high complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated attackers with contributor-level access or higher. Contributor-level access is considered a relatively low privilege level in WordPress, especially since such users have limited administrative rights but still have sufficient permissions to edit content and manage widgets. Thus, this qualifies as Low Privilege Required.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The malicious script only executes when a user visits a page containing the affected widget. Therefore, user interaction is required for the payload to run.

The impact extends beyond the original component into the broader user experience and potential exposure across multiple pages. The scope changes because the flaw impacts functionality and presentation in ways not inherent to the original system boundaries.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: There is no indication that sensitive data is exposed or leaked.

This occurs due to improper handling of reserved GDT blocks during a resize operation.\n\nLet’s analyze the vulnerability based on the CVSS v3.1 base metrics:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**: *Network (N)*  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists within the kernel's ext4 filesystem module and is triggered through legitimate system calls (`resize2fs`, `tune2fs`) used during normal filesystem operations. There is no network component involved; exploitation requires direct interaction with the filesystem via user-space tools. Therefore, the attack vector is **Local (L)** — the attacker must have access to the affected system to trigger the flaw. However, since the exploit is triggered via standard filesystem commands (like `resize2fs`) and does not require external network access, and the vulnerability arises from misconfiguration or misuse of existing tools, the correct vector is **Local (L)**.  \n→ **AV: L**\n\n---\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: *High (H)*  \nJustification: Exploitation requires specific conditions:  \n- The filesystem must be corrupted (corrupt ext4 image)  \n- The `resize_inode` feature must be disabled using `tune2fs -O ^resize_inode`  \n- The user must manually perform `mount`, `resize2fs`, etc., without running `e2fsck`  \nThis sequence of actions is non-trivial and requires knowledge of ext4 internals and proper setup. It cannot be exploited remotely or automatically. Thus, the attack complexity is high due to the need for precise configuration and environment setup.  \n→ **AC: H**\n\n---\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**: *None (N)*  \nJustification: The command `resize2fs` is typically executed by users with sufficient permissions (e.g., root), but the vulnerability itself is triggered through a known misuse of filesystem tools. However, the bug does not require elevated privileges beyond what is needed to run these utilities (which generally require root). But crucially, the vulnerability is not exploitable by unprivileged users — they would not have access to `resize2fs` or the ability to manipulate the filesystem structure directly. Still, the root cause is a logic error in kernel code exposed during a privileged operation.

However, this approach created a race condition between the DRM scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence is signaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed. This results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns a new job to the pointer. This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns it to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an interrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.

It involves a **race condition** between two threads:\n\n- The DRM scheduler workqueue (`run_job()`) assigns a new job to a job pointer.\n- The IRQ execution thread signals a fence and sets the job pointer to `NULL`.\n\nThis creates a situation where both operations happen concurrently — the IRQ thread sets the job pointer to `NULL`, while `run_job()` is assigning a new job to it. If the IRQ thread reads the job pointer *before* `run_job()` has assigned a new one, it may result in a **NULL pointer dereference**, leading to a kernel crash.\n\nKey points from the log:\n- Crash occurs due to **NULL pointer dereference**.\n- Triggered by GPU interrupt (`v3d_irq()`).\n- Happens during normal operation when jobs complete and interrupts fire.\n- No external input required; it’s a timing issue in concurrent access.\n- The crash leads to system instability (kernel oops), which implies loss of availability.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step Metric Assignment:\n\n#### **Attack Vector (AV)**  \n**Value: N (Network)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists in the kernel's internal graphics driver and is triggered via normal GPU interrupt handling. There is no need for network exploitation or remote access. The attack path is through normal device interaction (GPU rendering), which happens over the hardware interface. While not directly network-based, the exploit is initiated by legitimate GPU activity. Since the flaw arises from improper synchronization in kernel code that handles hardware interrupts, and there's no indication of remote access being needed, **the attack vector is best classified as Network (N)** under CVSS v3.1 because the vulnerability is accessible via normal system operation involving hardware (which is considered part of the network layer in broader terms). However, more precisely, since the attack is triggered internally by hardware events (interrupts), some might argue for **Local (L)**. But in practice, such kernel-level race conditions are typically assessed as **Network (N)** because they are exploitable via normal system use (e.g., running a GUI app like Chromium), which is a standard user behavior.

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in versions prior to 3.4.6 in the `pre_cadastro_atendido.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `msg_e` parameter. Version 3.4.6 fixes the issue.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists in a web endpoint (`pre_cadastro_atendido.php`) that accepts input via HTTP requests. An attacker can exploit this by sending a crafted request over the network, making the attack vector remote and accessible over the internet.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  \nJustification: The XSS vulnerability is reflected — the malicious script is directly echoed back to the user in the response. No complex conditions, authentication bypasses, or deep system navigation are required. Exploitation requires minimal effort and can be performed with a simple URL modification.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not require any authentication or privileged access. An unauthenticated attacker can trigger the reflection by injecting payloads into the `msg_e` parameter.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The victim must visit the affected page (e.g., the one containing the reflected message) to execute the malicious script. User interaction is necessary for the payload to run in their browser context.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects only the web interface and does not lead to changes in the application's internal state or data scope. There is no indication that the flaw impacts other parts of the system or causes out-of-scope behavior.\n\nConfidentiality (C): Low (L)  \nJustification: While the reflected content may expose sensitive information, the primary impact is that the attacker can inject JavaScript that runs in the user’s browser. This enables session hijacking or phishing, but the direct exposure of confidential data is limited. The main risk lies in manipulation rather than disclosure.\n\nIntegrity (I): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not allow modification of stored data or system files. It only executes client-side scripts. Therefore, integrity of data or system state is not compromised.\n\nAvailability (A): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not cause denial of service or disrupt services. The application remains fully operational; the only effect is unauthorized execution of scripts in the user’s browser.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 0.6999999999999993, "success": true}

This issue is fixed in iPadOS 17.7.4, iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3. Restoring a maliciously crafted backup file may lead to modification of protected system files.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability arises from improper symlink handling during restoration of backup files, which can be triggered via network-accessible backups or user-initiated actions involving external storage. While not directly initiated over the network, the attack surface includes user interaction with files that could originate from remote sources. However, since the exploit requires restoring a maliciously crafted backup—typically stored locally or transferred via user action—the primary access path is through local file operations. Still, given that such backups might be shared or accessed remotely, and no direct network exploitation is described, the most conservative and accurate assignment remains **Network (N)** due to potential indirect exposure via file transfer mechanisms. However, upon closer inspection: the attack involves restoring a file, which implies user-controlled input, but the file itself is likely stored locally or on a device. Thus, the actual attack vector is more accurately **Local (L)** because the malicious file needs to be placed on the device before restoration occurs — a local operation. Therefore, correction: **AV: Local (L)**  \n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: The attacker must craft a malicious backup file containing a symlink that targets protected system files. This requires deep knowledge of the system's directory structure and file protection mechanisms. The exploit does not trigger automatically; it depends on specific conditions being met during restore operations. Additionally, the victim must perform a restore action, making the attack non-trivial and requiring careful crafting. Hence, high complexity is appropriate.  \n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows an unprivileged user to modify protected system files by restoring a malicious backup. There is no mention of needing admin rights or elevated privileges to trigger the flaw. The exploit works when a user restores a backup, implying normal user-level access suffices. Therefore, **PR: None (N)**  \n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The attack requires the user to initiate the restore process of a maliciously crafted backup file. Without user interaction (e.g., manually selecting and restoring the file), the vulnerability cannot be exploited. This makes user interaction mandatory. So, **UI: Required (R)**  \n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects protected system files, which are normally restricted. By modifying these files through a legitimate restore mechanism, the attacker can alter critical system components beyond just the original affected area.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows script execution when users visit a page containing the malicious shortcode. The attack is delivered over the network via a crafted page, which is accessible to other users. There is no need for physical or local access; the exploit propagates through standard web traffic.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the vulnerability exists in a publicly exposed plugin feature, exploitation requires the attacker to first gain contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This means they must authenticate and have proper permissions—making the attack complex due to the need for both access and knowledge of the specific input field. Additionally, the attacker must craft a payload that survives sanitization, requiring careful testing and understanding of the system.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability can be exploited by attackers with contributor-level access or higher. In WordPress, contributor level is considered a relatively low privilege compared to administrator, but still sufficient to modify content. Thus, this is not \"None\" nor \"High,\" but rather \"Low\" because contributor-level access is a common and attainable role in many sites.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The victim must view a page that contains the malicious shortcode for the script to execute. The attacker does not directly interact with the user, but the user’s interaction (viewing the page) triggers the XSS. Therefore, user interaction is required.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the behavior of the plugin's shortcode rendering, allowing malicious scripts to be executed across multiple pages.

The fix involves calling `put_device()` and freeing the name in a cleanup callback.\n\nKey observations from the description:\n- This is a **memory leak** — failure to free allocated memory upon failure.\n- It occurs during device registration, which is part of normal kernel operation.\n- There is no indication that this leads to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or privilege escalation.\n- The flaw is in resource management (specifically, failure to clean up allocated memory on error).\n- The vulnerability exists in kernel code, so access may require elevated privileges or direct kernel interaction.\n- No user interaction is required; it’s triggered by a failed device registration path.\n- The impact is limited to memory usage — the system will consume more memory than expected, but there is no data exposure, integrity compromise, or availability loss directly stated.\n- Since it's a memory leak, the primary concern is **integrity** (data corruption due to uncontrolled memory use) or **availability** (resource exhaustion over time). However, memory leaks typically do not lead to immediate availability issues unless under sustained load, and here, the leak is confined to one component.\n\nNow, evaluating each base metric per CVSS v3.1 guidelines:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**  \n   - The vulnerability is in the kernel, accessible via device registration paths. An attacker would need to trigger a device registration failure (e.g., through malformed hardware or driver interaction).  \n   - This requires interaction with the kernel via a device interface, likely requiring physical access or privileged context.  \n   → **Network (N)** is incorrect because it's not exposed over network.  \n   → **Adjacent (A)** is possible if an attacker controls a device or driver, but still requires kernel-level access.  \n   → **Local (L)** is most appropriate since the issue arises during local device registration and can be triggered locally.  \n   ✅ **Choice: L**\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**  \n   - The vulnerability is triggered by a failure condition in device registration. Exploiting it requires triggering a specific failure scenario (e.g., invalid device parameters).  \n   - This is not trivial — it requires knowledge of the device registration flow and possibly manipulation of device setup.", "prediction": "X", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

Specifically, the problem arises when reading this sysctl variable while it may be being modified by another thread — leading to potential inconsistent reads due to lack of memory ordering guarantees. The fix involves using `READ_ONCE()` to ensure consistent reads under concurrent access.\n\nLet’s analyze the base metrics based on standard CVSS v3.1 interpretation principles:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**:  \nThe vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel, which is part of system-level software accessible via network interfaces. An attacker would need to exploit a flaw in a kernel component that could be triggered through normal network operations (e.g., sending multicast packets). There is no indication of physical access or direct local exploitation requiring hardware interaction.  \n→ **Network (N)** – The vulnerability affects a network-facing kernel feature; remote attackers could potentially trigger conditions via network traffic.\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**:  \nThe issue stems from a data race between read and write operations. However, such races typically require multiple threads or processes accessing shared memory simultaneously. In practice, triggering such a race requires coordination between two processes (or one process writing and another reading), which is non-trivial and not easily automated. It does not involve complex logic or configuration.  \n→ **High (H)** – Exploitation requires precise timing and concurrency, making it difficult to achieve reliably.\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**:  \nThis is a kernel-level vulnerability involving sysctls. Accessing or modifying sysctls like `sysctl_igmp_llm_reports` generally requires root privileges. Without elevated privileges, an attacker cannot modify or observe these settings directly.  \n→ **High (H)** – Root or kernel privilege is required to affect or observe the target.\n\n**User Interaction (UI)**:  \nNo user action is required to trigger or exploit the vulnerability. The race condition occurs during normal operation of the kernel when processing network packets.  \n→ **None (N)**\n\n**Scope (S)**:  \nThe vulnerability is confined to the IGMP subsystem within the networking stack.

An unsafe reading of environment file could potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. When loaded on an Windows application, Netty attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file, the Netty application crash. A similar issue was previously reported as CVE-2024-47535. This issue was fixed, but the fix was incomplete in that null-bytes were not counted against the input limit. Commit d1fbda62d3a47835d3fb35db8bd42ecc205a5386 contains an updated fix.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability arises from an improper handling of environment file loading in a network-based application framework (Netty). An attacker can exploit this by crafting a maliciously large file and triggering it via the environment variable mechanism, which is accessible over the network or through system configuration. Since the attack can be initiated remotely via environment variables, the attack vector is network-based.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the vulnerability involves a specific condition (large file creation), the attacker must create and manipulate a large file (potentially involving size control and timing) to trigger the crash. This requires careful crafting and coordination—such as setting an environment variable pointing to a large file—and does not involve trivial exploitation. Thus, the complexity is high due to the need for precise input manipulation.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability occurs when Netty reads an environment file during startup. An unprivileged user can set environment variables on a system where Netty runs, especially if the application is exposed to external inputs. No elevated privileges are required to trigger the issue; an attacker can exploit this from a remote or local session without administrative rights.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): None (N)  \nJustification: The crash occurs automatically upon loading the environment file, triggered by the presence of a large file. There is no requirement for user action (e.g., clicking a button or entering data) to trigger the vulnerability. It is fully automated once the environment variable is configured.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects only the Netty component itself and does not extend into other parts of the system or application. The impact is confined to the application's ability to start or function properly. There is no evidence of lateral movement or cross-component effects, so scope remains unchanged.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability leads to a denial of service (crash), not unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data. No information is leaked or accessed due to this flaw—it only causes the application to fail.\n\nIntegrity (I): None (N)  \nJustification: The issue does not allow modification of data or system state.

This array is passed to usb_check_int_endpoints function from usb.c core driver, which executes a for loop that iterates over the elements of the passed array. Not finding a null element at the end of the array, it tries to read the next, non-existent element, crashing the kernel. To fix this, a 0 element was added at the end of the array to break the for loop. [1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=9c9179ac46169c56c1ad\n", "response": "The CVE describes a stack-out-of-bounds read in the `usb_check_int_endpoints()` function within the HID driver for ThrustMaster devices in the Linux kernel. The issue arises because an array (`ep_addr`) is passed to a loop that does not properly check bounds — specifically, it continues past the end of the array when no null terminator is present, leading to a crash.\n\nLet’s analyze each CVSS v3.1 base metric based on the nature of the vulnerability:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**: **Network (N)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists in a kernel driver handling USB device communication. USB devices are typically connected via physical hardware and communicate over a network-like interface, but the attack requires interaction with a USB device (a peripheral). However, since the flaw is exploitable through normal USB device interaction (i.e., by plugging in a maliciously crafted device), and such interactions occur over a networked or system-level interface, the attack vector is best classified as **Network (N)** because the exploit can be triggered remotely via a USB device (which functions as a network endpoint in terms of access). While physically attached, the device is accessible via standard USB connectivity, which falls under network-like vectors in CVSS. In practice, USB-based attacks are often categorized as Network due to the device being plugged into a system over a shared medium.\n\n> Note: Some may argue for \"Physical\" (P) if the attacker must physically connect the device. However, in modern systems, USB devices can be spoofed or used in remote attacks (e.g., via USB-over-IP), and the vulnerability is triggered during normal operation of a USB device. Since the flaw is in a driver processing input from a device, and the device is accessible externally, **Network (N)** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: **High (H)**  \nJustification: Exploiting this vulnerability would require crafting a specific USB packet that causes the `ep_addr` array to have no terminating null element — meaning the attacker must precisely control the data structure sent to the driver. This level of precision makes exploitation difficult and requires deep knowledge of the USB protocol and the internal structure of the driver. There's no known way to trigger this without carefully constructed input. Thus, the attack complexity is high.\n\n---\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**: **None (N)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability occurs in a user-space-visible driver component (HID driver) that handles USB devices.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts through publicly accessible pages via a shortcode. Since the attack occurs over the network and does not require physical access or direct system interaction, the attack vector is Network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the exploit targets a known input field, successful exploitation requires the attacker to craft and submit malicious content through a user-supplied attribute in a shortcode. This involves precise manipulation of inputs and depends on the target user accessing the affected page—making it non-trivial and requiring some level of knowledge or testing, hence high complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability can be exploited by users with contributor-level access or higher. Contributor-level access is considered a relatively low privilege in WordPress, but still sufficient to create and publish content. Thus, this is not a \"None\" scenario, but rather a low-privilege requirement compared to admin-level access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The script injection only executes when a user visits a page containing the malicious shortcode. Therefore, user interaction is required for the payload to run. Without a user opening the page, no execution occurs.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the behavior of the plugin’s shortcode rendering process. The impact extends beyond just the immediate page where the shortcode appears—it can affect other users who view the page, and since the script runs in the browser context, it alters the scope of the application’s behavior. This indicates a change in scope from the original system to the end-user experience, thus qualifying as Scope Changed.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: There is no indication that sensitive data such as passwords, personal information, or private keys are exposed. The issue is about executing arbitrary JavaScript in the browser, which may lead to session hijacking or phishing, but the primary concern is not unauthorized disclosure of confidential data. Hence, confidentiality is unaffected.\n\nIntegrity (I): Low (L)  \nJustification: The attacker can inject arbitrary scripts into rendered content, potentially altering what users see or perform actions (like redirecting). However, the integrity of stored data or backend systems is not directly compromised. The modification happens client-side, so while there is a form of tampering, it is limited to presentation layer.

A malicious actor can leverage this vulnerability to cause a crash, read sensitive data, or execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability is exploitable via a maliciously crafted DWFX file that is delivered to the system through user interaction (e.g., opening a file). Since the file can be sent over the network or shared via email, the attack vector is network-based. There's no indication of physical access or direct local exploitation, so Network is appropriate.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows an out-of-bounds read triggered by parsing a specially crafted file. This implies minimal effort required—only a specific input manipulation is needed. No complex conditions or authentication steps are involved, making the attack complexity low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability occurs during file parsing and does not require elevated privileges. An unprivileged user can open the file and trigger the issue, leading to crashes, data exposure, or code execution in the context of the current process (which may be standard user).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The attacker must trick the user into opening the malicious DWFX file. Without user interaction (i.e., opening the file), the exploit will not activate. Therefore, user interaction is required.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability leads to memory corruption (out-of-bounds read) which could allow reading sensitive data or executing arbitrary code. This indicates that the impact extends beyond the original application scope—potentially affecting other components or allowing privilege escalation. Thus, the scope changes from the initial component to broader system effects.\n\nConfidentiality (C): High (H)  \nJustification: The vulnerability enables an out-of-bounds read, which can expose sensitive data such as memory contents, credentials, or internal state. This directly compromises confidentiality.\n\nIntegrity (I): High (H)  \nJustification: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process allows an attacker to modify program behavior, potentially altering data or system operations. This constitutes a high integrity impact, especially if the attacker gains control over execution flow.\n\nAvailability (A): High (H)  \nJustification: The vulnerability can lead to a crash of Navisworks, which would disrupt normal operation and prevent users from using the software.

It triggers a NULL pointer dereference in the periodic tick code. This happens because the legacy timer interrupt (IRQ0) is resent in software which happens in soft interrupt (tasklet) context. In this context get_irq_regs() returns NULL which leads to the NULL pointer dereference. The reason for the resend is a spurious APIC interrupt on the IRQ0 vector which is captured and leads to a resend when the legacy timer interrupt is enabled. This is wrong because the legacy PIC interrupts are level triggered and therefore should never be resent in software, but nothing ever sets the IRQ_LEVEL flag on those interrupts, so the core code does not know about their trigger type. Ensure that IRQ_LEVEL is set when the legacy PCI interrupts are set up.\n", "response": "The provided CVE description describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's x86/i8259 module related to improper handling of legacy PIC interrupts. Specifically, the issue arises due to a missing `IRQ_LEVEL` flag being set for legacy interrupts (like IRQ0), leading to a NULL pointer dereference during processing in a soft interrupt (tasklet) context. This results in a crash that can prevent the crash-kernel from booting successfully.\n\nLet’s analyze each CVSS v3.1 base metric based on the nature of the vulnerability:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**: **Network (N)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists in kernel-level hardware interrupt handling (PIC/legacy timer). It is not accessible over a network; exploitation requires direct access to the system at the kernel level, typically via privilege escalation or physical access. However, since the flaw is in internal kernel logic and not exposed through an application interface or network service, it cannot be remotely exploited. While the attack may require local execution, the vector is not network-based. But note: the vulnerability is not exploitable via remote input — it stems from incorrect kernel behavior under specific conditions (spurious interrupt). There is no user-facing exploit path. Therefore, the correct vector is **Local (L)** — attackers would need to gain control of the system (e.g., via privilege escalation or kernel panic manipulation) to trigger the condition. However, the actual exploit path involves a race or misconfiguration in interrupt handling, which could be triggered by normal system operation. Since the bug is not directly exploitable from outside the system, and requires local context, we assign **AV:L**.\n\nBut wait: the vulnerability is in kernel code that runs in tasklet context — it's not exposed to userspace or network. Exploitation would require either a malicious driver, kernel module, or system configuration change. Thus, **local access** is required. Hence, **AV:L** is appropriate.\n\n✅ Final choice: **AV:L**\n\n---\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: **High (H)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability depends on a specific sequence of events — a spurious APIC interrupt on IRQ0 causing a resend of a legacy PIC interrupt, which then triggers the NULL dereference. This scenario is not easily reproducible and requires precise timing, specific interrupt configurations, and possibly a known bad hardware setup. The attacker would need to manipulate interrupt delivery patterns, which is non-trivial and not straightforward. No simple exploit script or common attack pattern exists.

The server overrides the maximum size for websocket messages, allowing very large images to be tracked. This causes the server to become unresponsive to other requests while processing the large image, leading to a denial of service condition.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows an attacker to send maliciously crafted large WebSocket messages over the network to exploit the server's lack of message size limits. Since the attack is initiated remotely via network traffic, the attack vector is Network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the vulnerability exists due to a misconfiguration (overriding max message size), exploiting it requires sending extremely large payloads that may need careful crafting to trigger the DoS. The attacker must overcome potential rate-limiting or connection constraints, making the attack complex rather than trivial.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not require authentication or elevated privileges.

This indicates an attack over the network, not requiring physical access or local interaction.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability is triggered by simply visiting a specific page (localized backoffice component), which does not require complex conditions or user manipulation. It is easily exploitable under normal browsing behavior.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability requires authentication — meaning the attacker must be logged in as a valid user.

Add a NULL check for test_state.\n", "response": "The CVE describes a bug in the Linux kernel's kunit framework where `kunit_kzalloc()` may return a NULL pointer, and if that NULL is dereferenced without a proper null check, it could cause a null dereference. The fix involves adding a NULL check for `test_state`.\n\nLet’s analyze the base metrics based on the nature of this vulnerability:\n\n- **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability exists in the kernel, which is accessible via system-level operations. An attacker would need to exploit a kernel module or driver context, typically through a local process or kernel-level access. However, since the issue arises during normal kernel operation within a testing framework and does not expose an external network interface or user-facing component, the attack vector is most appropriately classified as **Local (L)** — because exploitation would require access to the kernel environment, such as running a privileged process or kernel module.  \n  → Value: **L**\n\n- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability is a simple null dereference due to missing null checking. It is a straightforward programming error; no complex conditions or interaction are required to trigger it. This suggests low complexity.  \n  → Value: **L**\n\n- **Privileges Required (PR)**: To reach the affected function (`kunit_device_driver_test`), one would need to be executing within the kernel context—typically requiring root privileges or kernel-level access. Thus, high privilege level is needed.  \n  → Value: **H**\n\n- **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability occurs during internal kernel execution in a test framework. There is no indication that user input or action is required to trigger the flaw. It is triggered automatically by the test execution flow.  \n  → Value: **N**\n\n- **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability is confined to the kunit testing subsystem within the kernel. There is no evidence that it affects other parts of the system or causes out-of-scope behavior. The impact remains within the same component.  \n  → Value: **U**\n\n- **Confidentiality (C)**: A null dereference does not result in exposure of sensitive data. It leads to a crash or undefined behavior, but no data leakage is implied.  \n  → Value: **N**\n\n- **Integrity (I)**: The vulnerability results in a crash or program termination, which might affect the integrity of the system state (e.g., halting a test). However, there is no modification of data or system state being written or altered.

The attack is initiated over the network via a web request (file upload), making the attack vector network-based.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability exploits insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. Once an attacker gains author-level access, they can easily trigger the script injection through a simple file upload; no complex interaction or manipulation is required.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability requires the attacker to have Author-level access or higher. In WordPress terms, this is not full administrative privilege but still a relatively low level of access compared to administrator privileges. However, since the exploit is triggered from within the system's content management interface, and the attacker needs to be logged in with such a role, this qualifies as \"Low\" privileges — not none, because authentication is required beyond just being unauthenticated.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The malicious script is executed when a user accesses the SVG file.

Since the plugin is accessible via a web interface and the attack involves sending crafted HTTP requests from remote locations, the attack vector is network-based.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the vulnerability exists due to missing CSRF protection and input sanitization, exploiting it requires the attacker to craft specific payloads and possibly trick the user into performing actions (e.g., via phishing or social engineering). Additionally, the attack may require precise timing or session manipulation, making it non-trivial to execute successfully—thus indicating high complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects authenticated administrators who are already logged in. However, the attacker does not need to gain administrative privileges; they can exploit the flaw once the admin is already authenticated. Thus, the privilege level required is low because the target is an existing authenticated user, not a system-level access requirement.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The attack relies on a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) mechanism, which typically requires the victim (admin user) to perform an action (like submitting a form) while being under the attacker’s control. This means the user must interact with a malicious page or link that triggers the vulnerable action. Hence, user interaction is required.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability impacts the functionality of the plugin by allowing stored XSS, which affects user data and session handling beyond just the immediate component. The impact extends to other parts of the application (e.g., user sessions, content rendering), meaning the scope changes from the original plugin module to broader application behavior.\n\nConfidentiality (C): Low (L)  \nJustification: The primary issue is not unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data but rather the injection of malicious scripts into content. While this can lead to session hijacking or data theft indirectly, the direct confidentiality breach is limited. The main risk is to integrity and availability via XSS-driven attacks, so confidentiality is considered low.\n\nIntegrity (I): High (H)  \nJustification: The vulnerability enables attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code (XSS) into content that is rendered to users. This allows them to modify or manipulate what appears on the site, potentially altering displayed information or stealing session tokens. This directly compromises the integrity of the content and user experience.\n\nAvailability (", "prediction": "X", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows script execution when users visit a page containing the malicious shortcode. The attack is delivered over the network via a crafted page, which is accessible to other users. There is no need for physical or local access; the exploit propagates through normal web traffic.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the vulnerability exists in a publicly accessible plugin feature, exploitation requires the attacker to first gain contributor-level access to the WordPress site. Additionally, the attacker must craft a malicious attribute and ensure it is rendered in a way that executes scripts—this involves careful manipulation of inputs and context, making the attack complex rather than trivial.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability can be exploited by attackers with contributor-level access or higher. Contributor level is considered a relatively low privilege in WordPress, but still sufficient to modify content. Thus, this falls under \"Low\" privileges required compared to admin-level access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The victim must view the page containing the malicious shortcode for the script to execute. The attacker cannot automatically perform the action; the user interaction (viewing the page) is necessary for the payload to run. Hence, User Interaction is Required.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the rendering of user-supplied content within a shortcode. Since the issue impacts how data is processed and displayed across the site, the scope expands beyond the original component (the shortcode itself) to affect overall site behavior and user-facing content. This indicates a change in scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: No sensitive data such as passwords or personal information is disclosed. The attack delivers client-side JavaScript that runs in the browser, not exfiltrating data. Therefore, confidentiality is not impacted.\n\nIntegrity (I): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not allow modification of stored data or system settings. It only executes scripts in the user’s browser. There is no alteration of data or system integrity, so Integrity impact is none.\n\nAvailability (A): None (N)  \nJustification: The attack does not disrupt services or cause denial-of-service conditions. The script runs normally in the browser and does not interfere with server operations or availability.

In versions 0.6.8 and prior, a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY AI where normal users are improperly granted permissions to export APP DSL. The feature in '/export' should only allow administrator users to export DSL. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can export the APP DSL. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.13.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to export APP DSL through a web interface accessible over the network. There is no indication that physical access or local exploitation is required; the attack is conducted remotely via HTTP requests to the /export endpoint.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  \nJustification: Exploitation requires minimal effort—only sending a request to the /export endpoint with appropriate credentials (or none). No complex interaction or configuration changes are needed. The flaw stems from improper permission checks, making it straightforward to trigger.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: Normal users (non-administrators) are improperly granted access to export DSL.

It was found from vmcore that perf had registered two ops with the same content successively, both dynamic. After unregistering the second ops, a use-after-free occurred. In ftrace_shutdown(), when the second ops is unregistered, the FTRACE_UPDATE_CALLS command is not set because there is another enabled ops with the same content. Also, both ops are dynamic and the ftrace callback function is ftrace_ops_list_func, so the FTRACE_UPDATE_TRACE_FUNC command will not be set. Eventually the value of 'command' will be 0 and ftrace_shutdown() will skip the rcu synchronization. However, ftrace may be activated. When the ops is released, another CPU may be accessing the ops. Add the missing synchronization to fix this problem.

Specifically:\n\n- A dynamically allocated `ftrace_ops` structure is registered twice with identical content.\n- Upon unregistering the second one, the system fails to properly update internal flags (`FTRACE_UPDATE_CALLS`, `FTRACE_UPDATE_TRACE_FUNC`) due to the presence of an active op with the same content.\n- As a result, during shutdown, `ftrace_shutdown()` skips RCU synchronization because the `command` field becomes zero.\n- This allows another CPU to access the now-freed memory while it’s still being used — leading to a **use-after-free**, which can lead to **arbitrary code execution** or **memory corruption** if exploited.\n\nKey characteristics:\n- Occurs in the **kernel** → affects system-level operations.\n- Requires no user interaction; triggered via normal kernel operation (perf event registration).\n- Exploitation would require privilege escalation to kernel level (only accessible by privileged processes or kernel modules).\n- The flaw leads to **memory corruption**, potentially enabling **arbitrary code execution** through control over freed memory.\n- No direct evidence of data leakage or denial-of-service, but memory corruption could allow arbitrary execution.\n\n---\n\n### Base Metrics Determination:\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**  \n→ **Network (N)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists within the kernel and is triggered via legitimate kernel operations (e.g., perf events). An attacker does not need to send packets or exploit network-based vectors. The attack path is internal to the kernel, so it's not exposed over a network. However, since the vulnerability is exploitable via kernel module or performance monitoring tools (like perf), and such tools can be invoked remotely (e.g., via a remote process using perf), the actual attack vector is **internal**. But under CVSS v3.1, **\"Network\"** applies when exploitation requires external communication. Since the trigger is local (perf event registration), and the issue arises internally, we classify this as **Local (L)**.  \n\nWait – correction: The vulnerability is triggered by registering two ftrace ops via perf, which is a **local kernel interface**. There is no network component involved. Therefore, even though perf might be used remotely, the **attack vector is local**.  \n\n✅ Final choice: **Local (L)**  \n*Because the vulnerability is triggered via kernel-level operations (perf event registration) performed locally on the host, requiring", "prediction": "X", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

Attackers can exploit this over the network by crafting malicious content that is rendered when users visit affected pages. There is no need for physical access or direct local interaction.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the attack is technically feasible, successful exploitation requires the attacker to have contributor-level access and to craft a malicious attribute that survives sanitization. This involves both knowledge of the plugin’s structure and careful payload construction, making it non-trivial. Input manipulation and bypassing sanitization require effort, indicating high complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability requires contributor-level access or higher within WordPress.

In CVSS terms, this falls under \"Low\" privileges required because it does not require full administrative rights—only contributor-level permissions.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The victim must click on a page containing the malicious shortcode for the script to execute. The attacker cannot automatically perform actions on behalf of the user; the user must interact with the compromised page for the XSS to trigger. Therefore, user interaction is required.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the rendering of user-supplied content in the context of a shortcode.

The issue occurs due to an incorrect packet length check that allows an integer overflow when handling large payload sizes on 32-bit systems. This issue leads to failed memory allocation and causes the server process to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists in the SFTP server's message decoding logic, which is exposed over the network. An attacker can exploit this by sending maliciously crafted packets over the network to trigger the integer overflow and cause a crash. Therefore, the attack vector is Network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the vulnerability involves an integer overflow, exploiting it requires crafting a specific payload with a very large size to trigger the overflow and cause memory allocation failure. This requires precise knowledge of the system’s packet handling and careful construction of the input, making exploitation non-trivial. Thus, the attack complexity is high.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not require authentication or elevated privileges to exploit. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send malformed packets to trigger the crash. No user account or privilege level is needed.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): None (N)  \nJustification: The attack can be performed automatically via network traffic; no interaction from the end-user is required. The victim simply needs to connect to the SFTP server, and the malicious packet will trigger the crash.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects only the SFTP server component and does not lead to changes in the behavior or functionality of other parts of the system. There is no indication that the compromise extends beyond the affected component, so scope remains unchanged.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: The issue results in a denial of service—no sensitive data is leaked or accessed. The server crashes, but there is no unauthorized disclosure of information.\n\nIntegrity (I): None (N)  \nJustification: The flaw does not allow modification of data or system state. It only causes a crash, so integrity is not compromised.\n\nAvailability (A): High (H)  \nJustification: The vulnerability leads directly to a denial of service by crashing the SFTP server process.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability was partially patched in the BuddyBoss Platform plugin in version 2.8.41.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows script injection through a publicly accessible parameter in a web application. An attacker can exploit this over the network by sending malicious payloads via a URL or form submission, making the attack vector network-based.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability arises from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in a public-facing parameter. Exploitation does not require complex conditions or interaction beyond sending a crafted request; it is straightforward and easily triggered.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability requires the attacker to have Subscriber-level access or higher. In WordPress terms, Subscriber is a relatively low privilege level compared to Admin or Editor, but still grants sufficient access to trigger the vulnerability. However, since the attack is executed via a stored XSS mechanism and the payload is stored on the server, the required privileges are not \"none\" nor \"high\"—they fall into the \"low\" category because Subscriber-level access is common and not extremely restrictive.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The attacker must first trick a legitimate user into visiting a page containing the malicious script (e.g., via phishing or social engineering). Since the script executes when a user views the page, user interaction is necessary for exploitation—this is typical of stored XSS vulnerabilities.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the user experience and content delivery across the platform. The malicious script is rendered in pages accessed by users, which means the impact extends beyond just the initial target to other users who view those pages. This indicates scope change because the vulnerability impacts multiple users and alters the behavior of the system's content rendering.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not allow unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data such as passwords or personal information. It only enables execution of client-side scripts, which may be used to steal session cookies or perform phishing—but the direct confidentiality impact is minimal. Thus, no confidentiality loss is inherent to the core flaw.\n\nIntegrity (I): Low (L)  \nJustification: While the primary effect is script execution, the attacker cannot directly alter or modify data. However, if the injected script modifies user data or performs actions like changing profile fields, integrity could be compromised. Given that the vulnerability allows arbitrary script execution in user-facing pages, there is potential for manipulation of user data, so we assign Low Integrity impact.\n\nAvailability (A): None (N", "prediction": "X", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

This enables the attacker to run commands as if they are a legitimate authenticated user. However, to exploit this vulnerability, the authenticated user must navigate to a malicious page during the GlobalProtect SAML login process on a Windows device. This issue does not apply to the GlobalProtect app on other (non-Windows) platforms.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to exploit the flaw by crafting a malicious webpage that is accessed during the SAML login process. Since the attack originates from the internet and requires no physical access or local compromise, the attack vector is network-based.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: Exploitation requires the authenticated user to manually navigate to a malicious page (user interaction required). This means the attacker cannot automatically trigger the exploit; it depends on the victim’s behavior, making the attack complex due to reliance on user action and specific conditions.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: While the attacker needs to trick the user into visiting a malicious page, the exploitation occurs within the context of an already authenticated Windows user. Thus, the attacker does not need elevated privileges—only the user's authentication session. However, since the user is already logged in, the privilege level is effectively low relative to full system admin rights.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The victim must actively visit a malicious URL during the SAML login flow. Without user interaction, the exploit will not occur. This is a clear requirement for user involvement.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the application environment (GlobalProtect app) and allows execution of code in the context of an authenticated user, potentially leading to broader impacts beyond just the app itself (e.g., command execution on the host OS). This indicates that the impact extends beyond the original scope of the vulnerable component.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows command execution, which can lead to data exfiltration, but the primary effect described is command execution rather than unauthorized access to sensitive information. However, since the core issue is about running arbitrary commands, confidentiality is not directly compromised—it is more about integrity and availability. Still, the lack of explicit mention of data exposure supports assigning N. But note: command execution implies potential confidentiality loss. Re-evaluating: Command execution enables reading files, so confidentiality may be affected. Therefore, better justification: High (H).\n\nRevised Confidentiality (C): High (H)  \nJustification: An attacker who runs commands as the authenticated user can read any file accessible to that user, including sensitive configuration files or personal data.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into an already existing query to store cross-site scripting in store reviews.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit the web interface by sending malicious input through a publicly accessible endpoint (the 'ssf_wp_user_name' parameter). Since the plugin is exposed over the network and accessed via HTTP requests, the attack vector is network-based.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the injection point exists directly in a public input field, exploiting it requires crafting a specific payload that includes SQL commands and potentially cross-site scripting content. The attacker must understand SQL syntax and structure to successfully inject and manipulate the query, which increases complexity beyond simple exploitation—thus qualifying as high complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not require authentication or elevated privileges.

Contributor-level access is not the highest privilege, so this qualifies as low rather than none or high. However, since the attacker needs to be authenticated to the site, it is not \"none\" — thus, \"Low\" is appropriate given that it is less than admin-level access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The victim must click on a page containing the malicious shortcode for the script to execute. The XSS payload only runs when a user visits the compromised page. Therefore, user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the behavior of the Table Editor plugin, specifically how user-supplied attributes are processed. Since the issue impacts functionality beyond just the immediate component (e.g., rendering scripts across the site), and because the attack alters the way content is displayed and executed, the scope changes from the original system state. Thus, scope is considered changed.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not allow unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data such as passwords or private information. It enables execution of scripts, but not reading confidential data directly. So confidentiality impact is not applicable here.\n\nIntegrity (I): None (N)  \nJustification: The attack does not alter or modify data stored on the server.

While 1.15.1 introduced a fix to restrict untrusted packages, the default setting of trusted packages still allows malicious classes from these packages to be executed. The exploit is only applicable if the client code of parquet-avro uses the \"specific\" or the \"reflect\" models deliberately for reading Parquet files. (\"generic\" model is not impacted) Users are recommended to upgrade to 1.15.2 or set the system property \"org.apache.parquet.avro.SERIALIZABLE_PACKAGES\" to an empty string on 1.15.1.

The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Despite CSRF protection preventing file uploads, the application still processes multipart boundaries, leading to resource exhaustion.

This vulnerability is present in the `/upload_avatar`, `/upload_app`, and `/upload_logo` endpoints.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network via a crafted request sent to the web application endpoints (e.g., /upload_avatar). There is no need for physical access or local interaction; the attack originates from a remote user.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the exploit involves sending a specially crafted multipart boundary, the attack requires precise manipulation of the request structure (appending excessive characters to trigger parsing). This level of precision and control makes the attack complex to execute successfully, especially given that the application has CSRF protections in place. The attacker must understand the internal parsing behavior and craft a valid-looking but malicious payload—this constitutes high complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not require authentication or elevated privileges.

User interaction is required for triggering this vulnerability.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Local (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists in libsthmbc.so, a library component that runs within the application context. An attacker must be on the same system (local) to exploit it, as there's no indication of network exposure or remote access being possible. Thus, the attack vector is Local.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the vulnerability involves an out-of-bounds write, exploitation requires user interaction (triggering specific input). This implies that the attacker must craft malicious input that the user will process, which increases complexity due to dependency on user behavior and precise conditions. Therefore, high attack complexity is appropriate.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code with privilege — but the description does not specify whether the attacker needs elevated privileges to trigger it. Since it's exploitable by a local attacker who can manipulate input (e.g., via user interaction), and no mention of requiring admin rights or existing privileges, we assume no special privileges are needed beyond normal user access. Hence, PR = N.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The CVE explicitly states “User interaction is required for triggering this vulnerability.” This means the victim must perform an action (like loading a file or viewing content) to enable exploitation. Therefore, UI = R.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects a core component (frame buffer decoding) and leads to arbitrary code execution, which may affect other parts of the software beyond just the vulnerable module. Arbitrary code execution typically results in broader impact across the system, indicating scope change from original boundaries. So, Scope = C.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability enables arbitrary code execution, not unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.

Confidentiality is not impacted directly.\n\nIntegrity (I): High (H)  \nJustification: With arbitrary code execution, an attacker can modify system behavior, overwrite memory, or alter program logic. This constitutes a significant integrity violation, allowing manipulation of data or processes.

Prior to version 1.8.179, there is no check to ensure that the user is disabling notifications for the mailbox to which they already have access. Moreover, the code explicitly implements functionality that if the user does not have access to the mailbox, then after disabling (enabling) notifications for this mailbox, the user will gain access to it. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.179.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit a flaw in the application's notification management logic without requiring direct network-level access to the system. Since FreeScout is a web-based application accessible over the internet, an attacker can reach it via the network to trigger the behavior—no physical or local access is required.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the vulnerability exists in a specific flow involving notification toggling, exploiting it requires the attacker to manipulate the interface to disable/enable notifications on a mailbox the victim already accesses. This involves precise interaction with the application’s UI and potentially guessing or crafting inputs. There is no automatic exploitation; successful exploitation depends on user actions and input manipulation, making attack complexity high.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not require authentication or elevated privileges. An unauthenticated attacker could potentially trigger the behavior by manipulating the notification settings, especially if the user is already logged in and has access to a mailbox. However, since the user must be authenticated to interact with the system, but the exploit does not require additional privilege escalation, the minimum required privilege level is none beyond basic user access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The exploit relies on the user performing an action—disabling or enabling notifications—for a mailbox they already have access to. Without user interaction (e.g., clicking a button), the malicious behavior cannot be triggered. Thus, user interaction is required.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability causes a change in the system's state: a user who previously had no access gains access to a mailbox simply by toggling notifications. This alters the scope of the affected entity (the user's access rights), meaning the impact extends beyond the original function, affecting access control. Therefore, the scope changes from initial to post-exploitation state.\n\nConfidentiality (C): High (H)  \nJustification: By gaining unauthorized access to a mailbox, the attacker can view private messages, emails, and other sensitive data. This directly compromises confidentiality, leading to exposure of personal or business information.\n\nIntegrity (I): High (H)  \nJustification: Once access is granted, an attacker can modify content within the mailbox (e.g., delete, edit, or alter messages). This undermines the integrity of the data stored in the mailbox, allowing unauthorized modifications.\n\nAvailability (A): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability", "prediction": "X", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

The vulnerable sockets were set to listen on all network interfaces, increasing the likelihood that an attacker is able to reach the vulnerable ZeroMQ sockets to carry out an attack. vLLM instances that do not make use of the mooncake integration are not vulnerable. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit unsecured ZeroMQ sockets that are configured to listen on all network interfaces. This means the service is exposed to remote attackers over the network, making the attack vector clearly network-based.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the socket is open to all interfaces, exploiting the pickle deserialization flaw requires crafting a malicious payload that can be executed via the insecure deserialization mechanism. This involves understanding the pickle protocol and potentially sending specially constructed data—indicating non-trivial complexity for an attacker to successfully execute the exploit.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists in a publicly accessible service (via ZeroMQ listening on all interfaces).

Subscriber-level access is considered a low privilege level in WordPress, especially since the attack does not require administrative rights. However, authentication is required, so this is not \"None\" but still falls under low privileges compared to admin or editor roles.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The attacker must interact with the web interface by visiting a page containing the vulnerable 'review_id' parameter and submitting a crafted request. User interaction is necessary to trigger the vulnerability; thus, it is classified as Required.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the database directly, allowing extraction of sensitive data such as user credentials or other private records. The impact extends beyond the original scope of the affected function (e.g., review display), affecting the entire application's data integrity and confidentiality. Therefore, the scope changes from the initial component to broader system-wide data exposure.\n\nConfidentiality (C): High (H)  \nJustification: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., user passwords, personal details). This constitutes a direct breach of confidentiality, leading to high impact on data privacy.\n\nIntegrity (I): None (N)  \nJustification: There is no indication that the attacker can modify or alter data. The vulnerability enables reading (extraction) rather than modification. Thus, integrity is not compromised.\n\nAvailability (A): None (N)  \nJustification: The attack does not disrupt service or cause denial-of-service. The plugin continues to operate normally even when exploited.

When it creates a node in tipc_node_check_dest(), after inserting the new node into hashtable in tipc_node_create(), it creates the bc link. However, there is a gap between this insert and bc link creation, a bc packet may come in and get the node from the hashtable then try to dereference its bc link, which is NULL. This patch is to fix it by moving the bc link creation before inserting into the hashtable. Note that for a preliminary node becoming \"real\", the bc link creation should also be called before it's rehashed, as we don't create it for preliminary nodes.\n", "response": "The CVE describes a NULL pointer dereference bug in the Linux kernel’s TIPC (Transparent Inter-Process Communication) subsystem. The issue arises when a broadcast packet arrives before a BC (broadcast channel) link is properly created, leading to a kernel crash due to dereferencing a null pointer.\n\nLet’s analyze each CVSS v3.1 base metric based on the nature of the vulnerability:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**: **Network (N)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability occurs in a network-facing component (TIPC used for inter-process communication over networks). An attacker could exploit this via network traffic (e.g., sending malformed broadcast packets) to trigger the crash. The attack does not require physical access or local execution — it is triggered remotely through network input.\n\n---\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: **High (H)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability requires precise timing — an attacker must send a broadcast packet *after* a node is inserted into the hash table but *before* the BC link is created. This timing condition makes exploitation non-trivial and dependent on specific conditions (e.g., race condition under load). Such conditions are difficult to reliably trigger, hence high complexity.\n\n---\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**: **None (N)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists in the kernel and can be triggered by any process sending a broadcast packet. No special privileges (e.g., root, admin) are required to cause the crash. Any user-level process can generate such traffic, making it accessible to unprivileged users.\n\n---\n\n**User Interaction (UI)**: **None (N)**  \nJustification: The crash is triggered automatically by network traffic (a broadcast packet) sent during normal operation. There is no need for user action or interaction; the exploit runs autonomously once the race condition is met.\n\n---\n\n**Scope (S)**: **Changed (C)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the kernel’s internal data structures (node hashing and link management). The flaw causes a system-wide crash (kernel panic), affecting the entire system’s stability. Since the impact extends beyond the original module (TIPC) to the whole kernel, scope changes — meaning the system behavior is significantly altered.\n\n---\n\n**Confidentiality (C)**: **None (N)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability leads to a kernel crash (NULL pointer dereference), not unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data. There is no leakage of confidential information; instead, the system becomes unstable.\n\n---\n\n**Integrity (I)**: **None (N", "prediction": "X", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

Since the attack is initiated from within the system (local access), the attack vector is Local.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  \nJustification: The issue arises due to improper handling of stored data—cleartext exposure—which means no additional complexity (e.g., bypassing authentication, exploiting network conditions) is required. An attacker with admin privileges can directly access the affected files or memory locations, making exploitation straightforward.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): High (H)  \nJustification: The vulnerability requires an attacker to already be authenticated and have administrative privileges to exploit it. This indicates high privilege requirements beyond basic user access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): None (N)  \nJustification: The attacker does not need to interact with the user interface; once authenticated with admin rights, they can directly access the cleartext data through local access. No interaction with the user is needed.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects only the specific component where data is stored (likely configuration or database). There's no indication that the breach leads to broader system compromise or impacts other parts of the application.

The root cause is not a direct privilege escalation or denial-of-service but rather a misalignment in memory access triggered by malformed or oddly sized inputs.

Attackers can exploit this over the network by injecting malicious scripts into content that users view, making the attack vector network-based.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the injection point exists in a public-facing shortcode, successful exploitation requires the attacker to craft and submit malicious input that is then stored and executed when viewed. This involves both crafting payloads and relying on user interaction to trigger execution, which increases complexity compared to direct, automatic exploitation.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability requires contributor-level access or higher to exploit, which is not full administrative privilege but still below \"None.\" Contributor-level access is considered low privilege in the context of required privileges, so we assign Low (L).\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The malicious script executes only when a user accesses a page containing the affected shortcode.

This depends on the values read from the llc_occupancy counters. The logic is applicable to architectures where the CLOSID effectively forms part of the monitoring identifier and so do not allow complete freedom to choose an unused monitoring identifier for a given CLOSID. This support missed that some platforms may not have these counters. This causes a NULL pointer dereference when creating a new control group as the array was not allocated by dom_data_init(). As this feature isn't necessary on platforms that don't have cache occupancy monitors, add this to the check that occurs when a new control group is allocated.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel's resctrl subsystem, which is accessed via system calls and internal kernel operations. It does not require external network access to exploit; exploitation would occur through normal kernel interaction (e.g., creating a control group). Thus, the attack vector is Network (N).\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: Exploiting this issue requires correct configuration and knowledge of the resctrl subsystem, including understanding of CLOSID allocation and cache monitoring. The vulnerability involves a NULL pointer dereference triggered under specific conditions (missing monitor counters), which implies complex conditions must be met—such as platform-specific behavior and proper initialization—which increases attack complexity. Therefore, AC is High (H).\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): High (H)  \nJustification: The resctrl subsystem is designed for resource control and typically requires elevated privileges (e.g., root or capable process) to create control groups. Only privileged processes can interact with such kernel-level features. Hence, high privileges are required.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability arises during the creation of a control group, a system-level operation that does not require user input. Once a privileged process initiates the operation, the flaw triggers automatically. No user action is needed.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects only the resctrl component within the kernel and does not lead to changes in the scope of affected systems or components. There is no indication that the flaw allows lateral movement or impacts other parts of the system beyond its intended function.

The attack requires Bitdefender BOX to be booted in Recovery Mode and that the attacker be present within the WiFi range of the BOX unit.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The attacker must be within the WiFi range of the device to exploit the vulnerability, which implies network proximity. While not fully remote, the attack is initiated over a wireless network, making the attack vector network-based rather than local or physical. Thus, AV = N.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: The vulnerability requires the device to be booted into Recovery Mode, which is not automatically available and likely requires specific conditions or user action. Additionally, the attacker must be physically near the device (within WiFi range) and may need to trigger the recovery mode manually—this combination of environmental and operational constraints indicates high complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform the downgrade. No login credentials, authentication tokens, or elevated privileges are required; the attacker can initiate the attack from outside the system without being authenticated.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The attack requires the device to be booted into Recovery Mode, which typically involves user interaction (e.g., pressing a button or navigating through menus). Since this step must be performed by a human operator (the user), user interaction is required. Therefore, UI = R.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the firmware update process, allowing a downgrade from a secure version to an older, potentially vulnerable one. This changes the security scope of the device’s behavior—its integrity and confidentiality are impacted due to the ability to bypass secure updates. Hence, the impact extends beyond the original function, indicating scope change.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not allow unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data. The attack focuses on firmware downgrading, not accessing stored data or private information. There is no indication that data is exposed during or after the downgrade. So, confidentiality is unaffected.\n\nIntegrity (I): High (H)  \nJustification: By enabling an unauthenticated downgrade to a previously compromised or outdated firmware version, the attacker undermines the device’s software integrity. This allows execution of malicious code or exploitation of known vulnerabilities in older versions. Integrity is significantly affected.\n\nAvailability (A): None (N)  \nJustification: The attack does not directly disrupt service availability. The device remains functional even if downgraded—it just runs a different firmware. Availability is not degraded or lost.

It states that a socket reference is not properly dropped in error paths, leading to a memory leak where an unreferenced socket object is left allocated.\n\nLet’s analyze the vulnerability based on standard CVSS v3.1 criteria:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**:  \nThe vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel, which is accessible over the network via system calls such as `setsockopt`. An attacker could exploit this through normal system-level operations involving BPF programs (e.g., using eBPF tools). Since the issue arises from misuse of internal kernel functions during socket operations, and no direct remote exploitation path is described, but the attack surface includes network-facing sockets, the most appropriate vector is **Network (N)**.  \n→ **AV: N**\n\n---\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**:  \nThe vulnerability involves a logic flaw in how socket references are managed when attaching BPF programs. This requires specific conditions — namely, setting `SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPF` on a TCP socket before it becomes established — which is a known configuration pattern used by legitimate applications. However, exploiting this would require knowledge of the internal behavior and possibly crafting specific program flows. While not trivial, it doesn’t require deep technical expertise beyond understanding BPF usage. There is no indication of complex interaction or unusual setup needed. Thus, complexity is **Low (L)**.  \n→ **AC: L**\n\n---\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**:  \nTo attach a BPF program to a socket, the process must have appropriate privileges. In Linux, this typically requires root access or elevated privileges (e.g., CAP_SYS_ADMIN). Therefore, the attacker needs **high privileges** to trigger the condition.  \n→ **PR: H**\n\n---\n\n**User Interaction (UI)**:  \nThis is a kernel-level memory leak triggered by a system call (`setsockopt`) during normal operation. No user action is required; the exploit is triggered automatically by a privileged process.  \n→ **UI: N**\n\n---\n\n**Scope (S)**:  \nThe vulnerability affects only the kernel’s socket reuse port mechanism. There is no evidence that the bug causes changes in functionality outside of the affected component (i.e., no data corruption, denial-of-service across services, etc.). The impact remains within the same scope.  \n→ **S: U**\n\n---\n\n**Confidentiality (C", "prediction": "X", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts through user-supplied shortcode attributes, which are then rendered in web pages accessible over the network. The attack does not require physical access or direct local interaction; it operates over the network via standard web traffic.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the exploit targets a known input field, successful exploitation requires the attacker to craft and submit a malicious shortcode attribute that survives sanitization. This involves careful payload construction and depends on the target user accessing the affected page—making it non-trivial and requiring some level of effort beyond simple injection.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: Attackers need contributor-level or higher permissions to create or modify content using the shortcode. Contributor-level access is relatively common in WordPress sites and is considered low privilege compared to administrator roles. However, since this permission level is required to trigger the vulnerability, it falls under \"Low\" in terms of privilege escalation needed relative to full admin rights.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The victim must visit a page containing the malicious shortcode for the script to execute. Without user interaction (i.e., visiting the page), the XSS payload remains inert.

Since these logs are served over the network (HTTP), an attacker on the network can potentially access them if they have access to the web server or log directory. However, the actual exposure is not directly through remote network exploitation but rather through access to publicly available or misconfigured logs. Still, since the logs are exposed via HTTP, which is a network-based service, the attack vector is considered Network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  \nJustification: Accessing the log files requires minimal effort—only reading existing log files from a web server. There's no need for complex authentication, configuration changes, or multi-step actions. Once an attacker has network access, retrieving the logs is straightforward, making complexity low.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows a local user to read log files that contain sensitive data.

But the description specifies “a local user with access to HTTP request logs,” implying that the user needs only access to the system’s log directory. If the logs are publicly accessible or accessible via standard HTTP paths, no special privileges are required beyond basic access rights. Thus, Privileges Required is None.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): None (N)  \nJustification: The issue does not require any action from the end-user (e.g., clicking a link or entering credentials).

So we move a null check before dereference.\n", "response": "The CVE describes a bug in the Linux kernel's pinctrl driver for ASPEED hardware where a potential NULL dereference occurs in the function `aspeed_pinmux_set_mux()` due to accessing `pdesc->name` when `pdesc` is null. The fix involves adding a null check before dereferencing.\n\nLet’s analyze the base metrics based on the nature of this vulnerability:\n\n- **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability exists in a kernel component that is accessible via system calls or device drivers. An attacker would need to exploit a flaw in kernel code, which can typically be triggered through malicious input or kernel module loading. However, since the issue arises from improper handling of a potentially null pointer during normal operation, and no external network interaction is involved, the attack does not require network exposure. It is internal to the kernel and likely exploitable via local privilege escalation or kernel module injection. Therefore, the most appropriate vector is **Local (L)** — because an attacker needs to gain control over the kernel environment (e.g., via local privilege escalation or direct kernel manipulation).  \n  → **AV: L**\n\n- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability is a simple null pointer dereference that occurs under specific conditions (when pdesc is null). This condition may be easily triggered by malformed input or incorrect configuration, especially if the system allows untrusted inputs into the pinmux interface. Since such inputs are relatively straightforward to craft and do not require complex setup or coordination, the complexity is low.  \n  → **AC: L**\n\n- **Privileges Required (PR)**: To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have access to the kernel subsystem (e.g., via root privileges or kernel module loading). The function `aspeed_pinmux_set_mux()` is part of the kernel's device driver layer, so exploitation requires elevated privileges. Thus, **High (H)** privileges are required.  \n  → **PR: H**\n\n- **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability is triggered automatically during execution of a system call or driver operation; there is no indication that user action is needed to trigger the crash. The null dereference happens internally during processing. Therefore, **No User Interaction** is required.  \n  → **UI: N**\n\n- **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects only the pinctrl subsystem within the kernel. There is no evidence that the issue leads to broader system compromise or changes in behavior outside the affected component. The impact remains confined to the driver functionality.

Prior to 1.33.1, 1.32.4, 1.31.6, and 1.30.10, Envoy's ext_proc HTTP filter is at risk of crashing if a local reply is sent to the external server due to the filter's life time issue. A known situation is the failure of a websocket handshake will trigger a local reply leading to the crash of Envoy. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.33.1, 1.32.4, 1.31.6, and 1.30.10.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Local (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability occurs within Envoy’s ext_proc HTTP filter when a local reply is sent to an external server due to a lifetime issue. This behavior happens during internal processing of requests and responses, specifically triggered by a failed WebSocket handshake. Since the attack requires interaction between Envoy and its own internal logic (i.e., local process handling), the attacker does not need to reach over the network; instead, the flaw manifests locally within the service instance. Thus, the attack vector is Local.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: Exploiting this vulnerability requires specific conditions—such as a failed WebSocket handshake—that must be orchestrated to trigger the local reply that leads to the crash. These conditions are not trivially exploitable and require precise configuration or timing. There is no indication that the exploit can be triggered easily or automatically under normal operation. Therefore, the complexity is considered high.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability arises from improper lifecycle management in the ext_proc filter, which is part of Envoy’s public-facing HTTP processing pipeline. An unprivileged user or even a misconfigured client could initiate a request that results in a failed WebSocket handshake, triggering the condition. No special privileges are required on the system to reproduce the scenario. Hence, Privileges Required is None.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The crash is triggered by a failed WebSocket handshake, which typically occurs during a legitimate client connection attempt. This means that a user (or client) must initiate a WebSocket connection that fails (e.g., due to malformed handshake or timeout). Without such interaction, the condition necessary to trigger the crash will not occur. Therefore, User Interaction is Required.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the stability of Envoy’s core filtering mechanism. While the initial impact appears limited to the ext_proc filter, the crash causes the entire Envoy process to terminate. This results in loss of service availability and potential disruption to downstream services, indicating that the scope expands beyond the original component into broader operational functionality. Thus, Scope is Changed.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not allow unauthorized access to sensitive data.

The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.9.6.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows remote attackers to exploit the flaw via a web request (e.g., accessing a page containing injected script). Since the attack can be initiated over the network without physical access or direct system interaction, the attack vector is Network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability arises from a missing capability check in JavaScript code, which means exploitation requires minimal effort—only authentication and access to a specific endpoint. No complex conditions or technical manipulation are needed; once authenticated, the attacker can trigger the behavior directly through normal browsing actions.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: Attackers need only Subscriber-level access or higher to exploit this vulnerability. In WordPress, Subscriber is a defined role with limited permissions but sufficient to access certain parts of the site. While not full admin rights, this level is considered low privilege compared to Editor or Administrator roles.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The attacker must trick a user into visiting a page that contains the malicious script injection. The execution occurs when a user accesses the affected page, meaning user interaction is required for the payload to run. Without a user opening the page, no execution happens.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the application's functionality by allowing arbitrary script injection on pages. This alters the behavior of the system beyond just the original component—it impacts how content is rendered and executed, leading to changes in the overall scope of the impact. Thus, the scope is changed.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: There is no indication that sensitive data such as passwords, personal information, or private files are exposed. The issue involves injecting scripts that execute upon page load, not exfiltrating data.

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `editar_permissoes.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `msg_c` parameter. The application fails to validate and sanitize user inputs in the `msg_c` parameter. This lack of validation permits the injection of malicious payloads, which are reflected back to the user's browser in the server's response and executed within the context of the victim's browser. This issue has been addressed in release version 3.2.6. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability involves a reflected XSS attack, where the attacker crafts a malicious URL that is sent to a victim via network communication (e.g., email, social media). The payload is delivered over the network and executed in the victim’s browser upon visiting the link. No physical access or local interaction is required.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  \nJustification: Exploitation requires minimal effort—only a simple crafted URL with a malicious script in the `msg_c` parameter needs to be sent to a victim. The attack does not require complex conditions, configuration changes, or specific system states; it can be triggered immediately by sending a malicious link.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization in a public-facing endpoint (`editar_permissoes.php`). An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this by simply injecting a script into the request.

Specifically, when the module `mtk-vcodec-dec.ko` is removed via `rmmod`, if the driver supports subdev mode, the pointer `dev->pm.dev` becomes NULL. The kernel then attempts to access this null pointer during cleanup, leading to a kernel crash (a segmentation fault or null dereference).\n\nThis results in a **kernel-level crash**, which means:\n\n- The system may become unstable or unresponsive.\n- The crash occurs due to improper handling of a NULL pointer during normal module removal — a common issue in kernel drivers.\n- No user interaction is required; the crash happens automatically when the module is unloaded.\n- The attack vector is network-based? Not directly. This is triggered by a standard system operation (`rmmod`), which is part of normal system administration.\n- The exploit requires no special privileges beyond being able to load/unload modules — but in practice, module loading/removal typically requires root privileges.\n- However, since the vulnerability exists in kernel code and can be triggered through a legitimate system call (`rmmod`), it does not require user interaction or elevated privileges beyond what is normally needed to manage kernel modules.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step Metric Assignment:\n\n#### **Attack Vector (AV)**  \nThe vulnerability is triggered by calling `rmmod mtk-vcodec-dec.ko`. This action is performed by a privileged process (typically root) on the system. It is not initiated over a network or from an external source.  \n→ The attacker needs physical or local access to execute the command.  \nHowever, since the trigger is a standard system operation that can be executed locally by a privileged user, and there’s no indication of remote exploitation, the correct vector is **Local (L)**.  \n\nBut note: In many kernel vulnerabilities involving module removal, the attack vector is considered **Network (N)** if the exploit could be remotely triggered — however, here, the trigger is direct and local. There is no evidence of remote execution.  \nThus, **AV = L (Local)**.\n\n> Justification: The vulnerability is triggered by executing `rmmod`, which is a local administrative action. No network communication or remote access is involved.\n\n---\n\n#### **Attack Complexity (AC)**  \nThe bug causes a crash when accessing a NULL pointer during module unload.

Malicious script payloads can be directly injected through standard user input (e.g., in a comment or snippet), making exploitation straightforward and predictable.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows cross-site scripting (XSS) in the snipper viewer, which typically requires no authentication or elevated privileges. Any authenticated user could potentially trigger the attack if they are able to submit malicious content—however, since the attack is client-side and relies on rendering untrusted data, no special permissions are needed beyond normal user access.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The victim must interact with the page (e.g., view a snippet containing malicious content) for the XSS payload to execute. This means the attacker cannot automatically compromise the session or system without the user clicking or loading the affected page. User action is necessary for the attack to succeed.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects only the snipper viewer component and does not appear to affect other parts of the application's core functionality or introduce out-of-scope behavior. There is no evidence of lateral movement or impact on unrelated systems or components.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: XSS does not allow unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information such as passwords or private keys. While it may expose session tokens if used in phishing contexts, the primary effect is not confidentiality leakage. The main concern is manipulation of the user’s browser context.\n\nIntegrity (I): Low (L)  \nJustification: The attacker can inject scripts into the page, which may modify the behavior of the application or redirect users. However, the integrity of stored data or system files is not compromised. The damage is limited to the user’s session or browser environment, not persistent data corruption.\n\nAvailability (A): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not cause denial of service or disrupt services.

A high privileged attacker with local access could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to BIOS upgrade denial.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Local (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists in the BIOS firmware and requires local access to exploit, as the attacker needs physical or direct local access to the system to interact with the BIOS. This indicates an Attack Vector of Local.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the vulnerability involves a mutable security version number, exploiting it likely requires specific conditions such as precise manipulation of firmware update processes, which may involve multiple steps or configuration checks. This implies higher complexity than straightforward exploitation.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): High (H)  \nJustification: The CVE states that \"a high privileged attacker\" is required to exploit the vulnerability. This clearly indicates that elevated privileges (e.g., administrative rights within the BIOS environment) are necessary, placing this in the High category.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: Although not explicitly stated, BIOS upgrades typically require user interaction (e.g., confirming updates or selecting options). Since the attack leads to denial of BIOS upgrade, user action (like initiating the upgrade process) would be needed to trigger the vulnerability. Thus, User Interaction is Required.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the BIOS functionality and alters its behavior by allowing downgrade or denial of updates. This changes the operational scope of the system—specifically, the trust model around firmware integrity—indicating a change in scope beyond just the affected component.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of MedDream PACS Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DICOM files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-25826.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows remote attackers to exploit it without requiring network access to a local system. Since the attack can be initiated over the network by sending maliciously crafted DICOM files, the attack vector is Network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: Exploiting this vulnerability requires crafting a specially designed DICOM file that bypasses input validation. While the flaw is in parsing, the attacker must understand the structure of DICOM files and create a payload large enough to overflow the stack buffer—this constitutes high complexity due to precise control needed over input size and format.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The CVE states that authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. An unauthenticated remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability, meaning no special privileges are needed.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): None (N)  \nJustification: The exploitation does not require any action from the end-user (e.g., opening a file or clicking a link). The attacker sends a malicious DICOM file directly to the server, which is automatically processed, making user interaction unnecessary.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects only the DICOM parsing component and does not indicate that the impact extends beyond the application’s core functionality. There's no indication that the compromise leads to broader system-level changes or lateral movement; thus, scope remains unchanged.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability enables remote code execution, but the primary outcome is the execution of arbitrary code rather than unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data. While some data might be accessed indirectly, the main impact is code execution, not confidentiality leakage.\n\nIntegrity (I): High (H)  \nJustification: Arbitrary code execution allows an attacker to modify system behavior, install malware, or alter processes.

Not all drivers implement that callback, leading to NULL dereferences. Example of affected drivers: ptp_s390.c, ptp_vclock.c and ptp_mock.c. Instead use a dummy callback if no better was specified by the driver.\n", "response": "The CVE describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's PTP (Precision Time Protocol) subsystem where certain drivers fail to provide an `info->enable` callback, causing a NULL pointer dereference when the ioctl or sysfs handlers attempt to invoke it. To mitigate this, the kernel now ensures a dummy callback is used if none is provided.\n\nKey observations from the description:\n\n- The issue arises due to missing implementation of a callback function in some drivers — not because of malicious input or user action, but due to improper driver design.\n- The vulnerability leads to a **NULL pointer dereference**, which results in a crash (a system-level crash).\n- This crash occurs during normal operation via standard kernel interfaces (`ioctl`, `sysfs`) — these are part of regular system calls.\n- No external attack vector is required; the flaw exists in how the kernel handles driver callbacks.\n- The vulnerability affects kernel code that runs in kernel space, so access requires privilege escalation or kernel-level execution.\n- However, since the issue stems from a missing callback and the kernel enforces a fallback (dummy callback), there’s no indication of exploitable remote code execution or data manipulation.\n- The crash causes a denial of service (DoS) — the system may hang or crash, affecting availability.\n- There is no evidence of confidentiality or integrity compromise — the crash does not leak sensitive data or alter system state.\n- User interaction is not required — the crash can occur automatically during normal operations (e.g., when calling `ioctl` on a device).\n- The scope remains unchanged — the vulnerability is confined within the kernel's PTP subsystem and does not affect other parts of the system significantly.\n\nNow, evaluating each base metric:\n\n- **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability is triggered through normal kernel interface usage (ioctl/sysfs). These are accessible over network or via userspace tools. Since the exploit path involves a standard system call, and the attacker could trigger it via a malformed ioctl request (e.g., from a user-space application), the attack vector is **Network (N)**. However, note that the actual trigger is internal to the kernel and driven by driver behavior. But since the exploit can be initiated remotely via user-space tools (e.g., using a tool like `ioctl` on a device), and the kernel is exposed to such interactions, **AV = N** is appropriate.\n\n- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability is triggered by a simple failure to define a callback.

There is no need for physical access or local file system interaction; exploitation occurs through standard HTTP traffic.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the attack is triggered by a user-supplied input, successful exploitation requires the attacker to craft a malicious input that is properly formatted and submitted within the context of a valid shortcode call. This involves understanding the structure of the input and the query execution flow, making it non-trivial and requiring some level of knowledge or trial-and-error — thus qualifying as high complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows exploitation by users with Contributor-level access or higher. In WordPress, Contributor privileges are relatively low compared to Administrator roles, but still allow posting content and using shortcodes. Since this is not requiring administrative rights or elevated system privileges, it falls under Low Privileges Required.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The attacker must trick a user into triggering the shortcode (e.g., by embedding it in a post or page). Without user interaction—such as viewing or editing a page—the vulnerability cannot be exploited. Therefore, user interaction is required.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the application's internal database operations by allowing injection into existing SQL queries. This leads to data extraction beyond the original scope of the shortcode functionality, affecting other parts of the application’s data handling. Thus, the impact extends beyond the initial component, indicating a changed scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C): High (H)  \nJustification: Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands to extract sensitive data such as user credentials, personal information, or configuration details from the database. This directly compromises confidentiality.\n\nIntegrity (I): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not allow modification of data or insertion of false records. It only enables reading of existing data. No alteration of stored data or system integrity is possible through this flaw.\n\nAvailability (A): None (N)  \nJustification: The attack does not disrupt services or cause denial-of-service conditions. The service remains available even when data is extracted.

Such attacks can be initiated over the network, allowing remote attackers to exploit the flaw without physical access. Therefore, the attack vector is Network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While command injection may seem straightforward, successful exploitation often requires precise crafting of inputs that bypass validation and trigger unintended command execution. This requires knowledge of the target system and careful payload construction, indicating high complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows privilege abuse, but the initial exploitation does not require elevated privileges. An unauthenticated attacker could potentially inject commands if they can send malicious input through accessible interfaces (e.g., web forms).

An attacker does not need physical access or local interaction; they can trigger the exploit remotely through web traffic.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the attack appears straightforward, successful exploitation requires precise crafting of a payload that triggers XSS when viewed in Firefox’s browser context. The victim (admin) must be actively viewing the log content, which introduces dependency on user behavior and specific browser handling—making the attack complex due to environmental constraints and potential mitigations.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject a script into a public chat, which then executes in the context of the admin’s browser when they view logs.

This can cause a deadlock in the scenario reported by syz-bot below: CPU0 CPU1 CPU2 ---- ---- ---- lock(console_owner); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(console_owner); As commit dbdda842fe96 (\"printk: Add console owner and waiter logic to load balance console writes\") said, such deadlock can be prevented by using printk_deferred() in kmalloc() (which is invoked in the section guarded by the port->lock). But there are too many printk() on the kmalloc() path, and kmalloc() can be called from anywhere, so changing printk() to printk_deferred() is too complicated and inelegant. Therefore, this patch chooses to specify __GFP_NOWARN to kmalloc(), so that printk() will not be called, and this deadlock problem can be avoided.

Specifically, the `its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity()` function calls `guard(raw_spinlock_irq)` — which enables interrupts upon exit from the protected block — while interrupts were already disabled at entry due to `raw_spin_lock_irqsave()`.

It is not accessible over a network; exploitation requires direct access to the kernel, typically via privilege escalation or kernel-level manipulation (e.g., through a local exploit or kernel panic scenario). Thus, the attack vector is **Local (L)** — attackers need physical or local access to the system. However, since this is a kernel-level logic flaw involving interrupt control, and no remote interface is involved, the correct vector is **Local (L)**.  \n→ Correction: **AV = L**\n\n> Note: While some kernel bugs may be exploitable remotely via certain side channels, this specific issue involves a mismanagement of interrupt disabling/enabling in a low-level kernel routine. No network exposure is implied. Hence, **Local (L)** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: High (H)  \nJustification: Exploiting this vulnerability would require precise timing and understanding of the interrupt disable/enable flow. An attacker would need to trigger the specific sequence of function calls (`irq_set_vcpu_affinity`, etc.) under controlled conditions, possibly requiring knowledge of the kernel internals and timing of interrupt states. There is no simple path to trigger the flaw — it depends on the interaction between spinlocks and interrupt flags. Therefore, the complexity is high.  \n→ **AC = H**\n\n---\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**: High (H)  \nJustification: The vulnerability occurs in kernel code related to CPU affinity and interrupt routing.

This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected Sony XAV-AX8500 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-26284.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication, indicating that the attack originates from a remote network location. While \"Adjacent\" might seem plausible due to the phrase \"network-adjacent,\" the actual exploitation does not require physical proximity or direct access to the device; rather, it occurs over a network. However, in standard CVSS interpretation, \"Network\" (N) applies when an attacker exploits via the network layer, which fits here since the attack is initiated remotely over the network. \"Adjacent\" (A) would imply a more constrained, nearby environment (e.g., same subnet or local network segment). Given that the vulnerability enables remote bypass via Bluetooth over the network, and no specific adjacency constraint is mentioned, **Network (N)** is appropriate.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: Although the vulnerability allows bypassing authentication, the description indicates that the flaw lies in improper isolation of L2CAP channels—this implies that the attacker must understand or manipulate Bluetooth protocol behavior, potentially requiring some level of knowledge about the communication stack. There's no indication that the exploit is trivial or automated; instead, it requires careful crafting to exploit the missing isolation. Thus, exploiting this flaw involves non-trivial steps, leading to high complexity. Therefore, **High (H)** is justified.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The CVE explicitly states that \"authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\" This means an unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability without needing any user privileges or login credentials.

It also specifies that the fix applies to specific versions of macOS (Ventura 13.7.3, Sequoia 15.3, Sonoma 14.7.3). The vulnerability allows a malicious application to expose sensitive user data — indicating a confidentiality breach.\n\nLet’s analyze each base metric based on standard CVSS v3.1 interpretation principles:\n\n- **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability arises from a malicious application, which implies an external attacker using a software-based attack. Since applications can be distributed over networks or installed by users, this is primarily accessible over the network.  \n  → Value: **Network (N)**  \n  Justification: Malicious apps typically reach users via network distribution (e.g., app stores, phishing, downloads), so the attack vector is network-level.\n\n- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The issue involves a flaw in state management that could allow leakage of sensitive data. No complex conditions or technical barriers are described; the leak appears exploitable under normal circumstances.  \n  → Value: **Low (L)**  \n  Justification: The vulnerability does not require unusual configuration, advanced knowledge, or multi-step actions to exploit — it's straightforward to trigger given access to a malicious app.\n\n- **Privileges Required (PR)**: A malicious application needs to be installed or run — this suggests no elevated privileges are required beyond normal app execution rights.

We hold ieee->beacon_lock in position (1) of thread 1 and use del_timer_sync() to wait timer to stop, but timer handler also need ieee->beacon_lock in position (2) of thread 2. As a result, ieee80211_beacons_stop() will block forever. This patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of spin_lock_irqsave(), which could let timer handler to obtain the needed lock.\n", "response": "The CVE describes a deadlock issue in the `ieee80211_beacons_stop()` function within the Linux kernel's wireless driver (`rtl8192u`). The problem arises due to improper locking order and timing between two threads: one calling `ieee80211_send_beacon()` and another handling a timer callback that requires the same mutex (`ieee->beacon_lock`).\n\nKey points from the description:\n- The vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel, specifically in a driver component.\n- It causes a **deadlock** where two threads attempt to acquire the same lock in different orders — one holds the lock while waiting for a timer to stop, and the other needs the same lock when executing its timer handler.\n- The fix involves moving `del_timer_sync()` out of the critical section protected by `spin_lock_irqsave()`, thus avoiding the deadlock.\n- No user interaction is required; this is an internal kernel-level race condition.\n- The attack vector is through normal system operation — no external input or malicious action is needed.\n- The vulnerability affects kernel code, so exploitation would require access to the kernel (e.g., via privilege escalation or kernel module loading).\n- Since it’s a deadlock, the impact is not direct data theft or service disruption — rather, it leads to a hang or unresponsive system, which impacts availability.\n- The scope remains unchanged because the issue is confined to the specific subsystem (wireless beacon management); there is no evidence of lateral movement or broader system compromise.\n\nNow, evaluating each base metric:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**: Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability is in the kernel and occurs during normal execution of network-related functions (beacon transmission). An attacker does not need to send packets over the network to trigger it. However, since the issue stems from internal kernel behavior under normal operation, and no remote exploit path is described, the correct vector is **Adjacent (A)**? Wait — reconsider.\n\nActually, the vulnerability is triggered internally during normal kernel operations (e.g., stopping beacons), and it does not require network communication to be exploited. But the attack vector is not physical or local in the sense of requiring local access — rather, it's a flaw in how the kernel handles concurrent access to shared resources. However, in CVSS v3.1, **\"Local\" (L)** applies when the attacker can execute code locally (e.g., via kernel module or privilege escalation).

Fix the validation avoiding the addition.\n", "response": "The CVE describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's firmware handling, specifically in the `arm_scmi` subsystem. The issue arises during protocol enumeration when validating the number of returned protocols via `BASE_DISCOVER_LIST_PROTOCOLS`. The flaw lies in improper validation due to potential integer overflow from adding unsigned integers — this can lead to a silent bypass of the validation logic.\n\nLet’s analyze each CVSS v3.1 base metric based on the nature of the vulnerability:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**: **Network (N)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists in a firmware interface used by the ARM SCMI (System Control and Management Interface) protocol, which operates at the system level and is accessed through kernel-level interactions. However, exploitation would require interaction with the kernel via a firmware update or device communication path, typically initiated over a network or hardware interface. Since the attack surface involves a system-level component exposed to external firmware or management traffic, and no direct remote code execution is implied, but the attack may be triggered remotely via firmware delivery or configuration, the most appropriate vector is **Network (N)**. It is not directly accessible via local user input or physical access, but the attack path is mediated through a network or device interface.\n\n> Note: Though the vulnerability is internal to the kernel, the exposure point (SCMI) is often used in system management over networks. Thus, network-based access is plausible.\n\n---\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: **High (H)**  \nJustification: Exploiting this vulnerability requires precise manipulation of the protocol enumeration request such that the sum of unsigned integers overflows, leading to incorrect validation. This requires knowledge of the internal structure of the SCMI protocol, understanding of how the loop count is calculated, and potentially crafting specific inputs to trigger overflow. Such behavior is non-trivial and depends on deep knowledge of the firmware interface and memory layout. There is no indication of trivial exploitability; thus, **High (H)** is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**: **High (H)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability resides in the kernel's firmware subsystem, which is protected by kernel privileges. Access to modify or invoke firmware-related operations like protocol discovery typically requires root or kernel-level access. An attacker would need to have elevated privileges (e.g., running as root or with kernel module loading rights) to interact with this functionality. Therefore, **High (H)** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**User Interaction (UI)**: **None (N)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability occurs", "prediction": "X", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

Such deadlock can happen in the following situation. When all journal buckets are fully filled by active jset with heavy write I/O load, the cache set registration (after a reboot) will load all active jsets and inserting them into the btree again (which is called journal replay). If a journaled bkey is inserted into a btree node and results btree node split, new journal request might be triggered. For example, the btree grows one more level after the node split, then the root node record in cache device super block will be upgrade by bch_journal_meta() from bch_btree_set_root(). But there is no space in journal buckets, the journal replay has to wait for new journal bucket to be reclaimed after at least one journal bucket replayed. This is one example that how the journal no-space deadlock happens. The solution to avoid the deadlock is to reserve 1 journal bucket in run time, and only permit the reserved journal bucket to be used during cache set registration procedure for things like journal replay. Then the journal space will never be fully filled, there is no chance for journal no-space deadlock to happen anymore. This patch adds a new member \"bool do_reserve\" in struct journal, it is inititalized to 0 (false) when struct journal is allocated, and set to 1 (true) by bch_journal_space_reserve() when all initialization done in run_cache_set(). In the run time when journal_reclaim() tries to allocate a new journal bucket, free_journal_buckets() is called to check whether there are enough free journal buckets to use. If there is only 1 free journal bucket and journal->do_reserve is 1 (true), the last bucket is reserved and free_journal_buckets() will return 0 to indicate no free journal bucket. Then journal_reclaim() will give up, and try next time to see whetheer there is free journal bucket to allocate. By this method, there is always 1 jouranl bucket reserved in run time. During the cache set registration, journal->do_reserve is 0 (false), so the reserved journal bucket can be used to avoid the no-space deadlock.\n", "response": "Analysis of the CVE Description:\n\nThe described vulnerability involves a deadlock issue in the Linux kernel's bcache subsystem due to journal space exhaustion under high write I/O loads. The fix introduces a mechanism to reserve one journal bucket during cache set registration to prevent deadlocks caused by full journal buckets.\n\nKey Observations:\n\n- **Attack Vector**: The vulnerability exists within the Linux kernel, which is accessible over the network via system calls or kernel-level operations. However, exploitation would require direct interaction with the kernel (e.g., through system configuration or low-level operations), not necessarily external network access. Since the issue arises during normal operation (reboot, cache registration, journal replay), and does not involve remote code execution or network-based attack vectors, the attack vector is best classified as **Local (L)** — an attacker would need local access to the system to trigger conditions leading to the deadlock.\n\n- **Attack Complexity**: The condition (all journal buckets full + heavy write I/O load + cache set registration post-reboot) requires specific, predictable workloads and timing. It is not easily triggered by arbitrary actions; it depends on sustained high-write scenarios. While not trivial, the scenario is somewhat predictable and controllable. Therefore, the complexity is **High (H)** — attackers cannot exploit it without reproducing specific conditions.\n\n- **Privileges Required**: The vulnerability occurs in the kernel’s internal data structures and is tied to cache management during system boot/restart. To observe or trigger such behavior, an attacker would need elevated privileges (kernel-level access), likely requiring root or equivalent. Thus, **High (H)** privileges are required.\n\n- **User Interaction**: The deadlock occurs automatically during normal system operations (post-reboot cache registration), without requiring user input or action. There is no indication that a user needs to perform any step to trigger the vulnerability. Hence, **None (N)**.\n\n- **Scope**: The vulnerability affects only the bcache module within the Linux kernel. No evidence suggests that the flaw impacts other components or systems beyond its own scope. Therefore, the scope remains **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n- **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability does not expose sensitive data. It is a deadlock issue affecting system stability, not data leakage. So, **None (N)**.\n\n- **Integrity (I)**: The issue does not allow modification of data or system state. It only causes a deadlock during journal replay, which may lead to service disruption but does not alter data integrity.

However, since the flaw is internal to kernel code and not exposed directly through an external service, and no remote exploitation path is indicated, the attack vector is best classified as **Network (N)** because the affected functionality (ICMP echo) is typically accessed via network-level operations (e.g., ping). Even though the race is within kernel internals, the exposure point is through system configuration and network traffic.  \n  → **AV: N**\n\n- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability arises from a data race between read and write operations on a shared variable. This requires two threads/processes to operate simultaneously—one reading, one modifying—which is non-trivial but feasible under normal system load. There is no indication that special conditions or complex setup are required. Therefore, the complexity is **High (H)** because coordination between multiple processes is needed.  \n  → **AC: H**\n\n- **Privileges Required (PR)**: The `sysctl_icmp_echo_enable_probe` is a kernel parameter that can be accessed and modified by userspace via `sysctl`, typically requiring root privileges. However, the vulnerability itself does not require elevated privileges to *trigger* the race—it could occur when a privileged process reads the value while another modifies it. But the actual exploitation (reading a potentially corrupted value) still requires some level of privilege to access the sysctl interface. Since the race involves kernel internals and user-space interaction, the attacker needs at least local administrative rights.  \n  → **PR: L** (Low — the attacker doesn't need full root, just ability to trigger sysctl calls; however, full control might be needed to modify the value. Still, the race can be triggered by unprivileged processes if they can observe the value under concurrent modification.

This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network since the affected endpoint (the run inspection view) is accessible via a web interface, and an attacker can send malicious input through a URL parameter (e.g., run ID) that is directly rendered as HTML. No physical access or local interaction is required.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the attack appears straightforward, the attacker must craft a malicious run ID containing script payloads that are then rendered in the browser. The victim must visit the page with the malicious run ID, which implies coordination between attacker and victim. Additionally, the payload must be properly encoded or formatted to avoid filtering—this adds complexity due to potential input sanitization or encoding issues. Thus, exploitation requires more than just sending data; it involves crafting and delivery, making it high complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not require authentication or elevated privileges. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this by manipulating the run ID parameter in a public-facing URL. There is no indication that the system enforces role-based access control at the point of injection.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The victim must manually open the URL containing the malicious run ID to trigger the XSS.

Specifically, while reading the value, another thread may modify it simultaneously, leading to inconsistent reads. This is addressed by using `READ_ONCE()` to ensure consistent access.\n\nLet’s analyze each CVSS v3.1 base metric based on the nature of this vulnerability:\n\n- **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability exists in the kernel's internal system call handling (`sysctl_tcp_early_retrans`). It affects a core component accessible via system calls, which are typically invoked over the network or through privileged processes. However, exploitation would require direct interaction with the kernel via a process that can trigger the affected sysctl. Since the issue arises from concurrent access during normal operation and does not involve external network-based attack vectors, but rather internal kernel behavior, the most appropriate vector is **Network (N)** because system calls are accessed via networked services or user-space tools that interface with the kernel — though technically local, such access is often considered network-level due to the system call interface being exposed externally. However, since no remote attacker can directly exploit this without privilege escalation or kernel access, and the flaw is within an internal kernel data race, the correct classification should reflect that the vulnerability is exploitable via local execution (e.g., a malicious process). But note: the vulnerability is not triggered by a remote attack; it's a data race that occurs when multiple threads access shared memory. Therefore, the actual attack vector requires local access to the system (i.e., running a process with sufficient privileges). Hence, **Local (L)** is more accurate.  \n  → **Choice: L** (Exploitation requires a locally executing process with access to the kernel, e.g., root or elevated privileges.)\n\n- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The data race occurs due to concurrent access to a shared variable. The vulnerability is inherent in how the code handles concurrent reads/writes — it doesn't require complex conditions or specific timing. Any two threads accessing the variable at the same time will expose the race. This makes the attack relatively straightforward and predictable.  \n  → **Choice: L** (Low complexity due to simple concurrency scenario)\n\n- **Privileges Required (PR)**: To access `sysctl_tcp_early_retrans`, a process must have appropriate permissions (typically root or kernel-level access).

It does not require network access; exploitation would occur through kernel module interaction or direct access to the device interface. However, since the flaw is within a kernel subsystem accessible via a userspace interface (like sysfs or ioctl), the attack vector is effectively **local**, as the attacker needs to have access to the system (e.g., via privilege escalation or kernel module loading). But note: the vulnerability itself is not exploitable over a network. The actual exploit path requires local access to the kernel module or device. Therefore, **AV = L (Local)** is more accurate than N.  \nHowever, the vulnerability is not directly exploitable by remote attackers due to lack of network exposure. Since no external communication is involved, and the issue stems from improper initialization of a structure used in user-space data transfer, the attacker must be on the same host. Thus, **AV = L (Local)**.\n\nBut wait: the vulnerability is in a kernel component that exposes data to userspace. If an attacker can trigger the use of the triggered buffer (via a specific ioctl or device operation), they may observe uninitialized data.

Prior to version 1.8.180, there is a mass assignment vulnerability. The Customer object is updated using the fill() method, which processes fields such as channel and channel_id. However, the fill() method is called with all client-provided data, including unexpected values for channel and channel_id, leading to a mass assignment vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.180.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability arises from unfiltered input being processed via the `fill()` method in a web application exposed over HTTP. An attacker can send malicious requests over the network to exploit this flaw, making the attack vector network-based.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  \nJustification: The mass assignment vulnerability allows an attacker to directly manipulate fields like `channel` and `channel_id` by sending a simple HTTP request with crafted form or JSON payload. No complex interaction or deep system knowledge is required—this is a straightforward exploitation path.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: There is no indication that authentication or specific user roles are needed to trigger the mass assignment. The vulnerability exists when any user submits data through the interface, meaning an unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit it if they have access to the endpoint.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: Although the attack can be triggered remotely, the victim must interact with the application (e.g., submit a form or make a request) to trigger the mass assignment. This implies user interaction is necessary for the exploit to succeed—hence, User Interaction is Required.\n\nScope (S): Unchanged (U)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects only the Customer object's attributes and does not appear to affect other parts of the system or cause cascading changes across unrelated components. The impact remains confined within the scope of the affected object.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: Mass assignment does not allow unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data; it enables modification of object properties. There is no leakage of private information, so confidentiality is unaffected.\n\nIntegrity (I): High (H)  \nJustification: Attackers can overwrite critical fields such as `channel` and `channel_id`, effectively altering the state of customer records. This constitutes a direct integrity violation, allowing unauthorized modifications to data.\n\nAvailability (A): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not disrupt services, crash the application, or consume resources in a way that impacts availability.

The interface need to be released before unregistering hci device when usb disconnect. Removing BT usb dongle without properly releasing the interface may cause Kernel panic while unregister hci device.\n", "response": "The provided CVE description describes a flaw in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem related to improper handling of USB interrupt interfaces during disconnection of a MediaTek-based BT USB dongle. Specifically, failure to release a USB interrupt interface before unregistering the HCI device can lead to a kernel panic upon removal of the device.\n\nLet’s analyze each CVSS v3.1 base metric based on the nature of this vulnerability:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**:  \nThe vulnerability arises from incorrect cleanup logic during USB disconnection. An attacker would need to physically remove the BT USB dongle (a hardware action) or trigger a system-level disconnect event. This is not remotely exploitable; it requires physical access to the device.  \n→ **Physical (P)** — However, note that the attack vector is tied to a specific hardware interaction (removing a USB dongle). While the exploit does not require active network attacks, it is triggered by user action involving physical device removal. In practice, such flaws are often classified under **Network (N)** if remote exploitation is possible, but here there is no indication of remote code execution or network-based triggering. Since the issue occurs during device unplug, which is a local hardware operation, and the vulnerability is triggered via normal device removal, the most accurate classification is **Local (L)** — because the attacker needs to have control over the system and perform a device removal action, which is within the local environment.  \n→ **Chosen Value: L (Local)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability is triggered during USB disconnection, which is a local operation performed by a user or process on the host system. No external network access is required.\n\n---\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**:  \nTo exploit this, the attacker must either remove the device or trigger a disconnection scenario. There is no requirement for complex configuration, timing, or manipulation beyond removing the device. The flaw exists due to missing cleanup logic, so exploiting it requires minimal effort once the device is unplugged.  \n→ **Low (L)**  \nJustification: Exploitation requires only a simple action—removing the USB dongle—which is straightforward and does not involve complex conditions or adversarial setup.\n\n---\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**:  \nThe vulnerability occurs during device unregistration, which typically happens at the OS level. To remove a USB device, the user generally needs administrative privileges (e.g., root or sudo). Without elevated permissions, the user cannot safely remove certain devices. Therefore, privilege escalation is likely needed.  \n→ **High", "prediction": "X", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows script execution when users visit a page containing the malicious shortcode. The attack is delivered over the network via a crafted page, which is accessible to other users. There is no need for physical or local access; the exploit propagates through standard web traffic.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the vulnerability exists in a publicly accessible shortcode, exploitation requires the attacker to first gain contributor-level access to the WordPress site (which is not trivial). Additionally, the attacker must craft a malicious attribute and ensure it is stored and rendered in a way that executes scripts—this involves multiple steps and precise inputs, making the attack complex rather than straightforward.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability can be exploited by attackers with contributor-level access or higher. In WordPress, contributor level is considered a relatively low privilege compared to administrator, but still sufficient to add content or modify posts. Thus, this is not \"None\" nor \"High,\" but falls under \"Low\" because contributor privileges are less privileged than admin, yet still allow the necessary actions.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The victim must open a page that contains the malicious shortcode for the script to execute. The attacker does not directly interact with the user, but the user’s interaction (viewing the page) triggers the XSS payload. Therefore, user interaction is required.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the behavior of the plugin's output rendering, allowing malicious scripts to be executed across the site. Since the impact extends beyond just the affected page to potentially all users who view such pages, the scope changes from the original component to broader site-wide effects. This indicates a change in scope.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not allow unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data. It enables script injection, which may lead to session hijacking or phishing, but the primary concern is not confidentiality leakage. No direct exposure of private information occurs.\n\nIntegrity (I): Low (L)  \nJustification: While the script injection could alter the content displayed, it does not allow modification of system files or database entries.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request).\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit the flaw remotely through controlled content on the target site or its subdomain, which is accessible over the network. There is no need for physical access or direct local interaction; the attack occurs over the network via crafted web content or malicious scripts.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the vulnerability exists in the middleware logic, exploitation requires the attacker to first gain some form of access—such as through XSS—to inject malicious content into the target site or its subdomain. This means the attacker must perform multiple steps (e.g., injecting code, manipulating headers) to successfully bypass CSRF checks, indicating high complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The attacker does not need to authenticate or possess any special privileges. They can exploit this vulnerability simply by controlling content on the target site or a subdomain, such as via XSS, which is publicly accessible and does not require login or administrative rights.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The attacker must trick a victim into interacting with their content—for instance, by embedding malicious scripts in a page the user visits. Without user interaction (e.g., clicking a link or loading a script), the CSRF token cannot be extracted or used to make unauthorized requests. Thus, user interaction is required.\n\nScope (S): Changed (C)  \nJustification: The vulnerability affects the behavior of the application’s session management and CSRF token handling across domains. An attacker can manipulate cookies from a subdomain to affect the main domain, leading to changes in the application’s scope beyond the original context. This indicates a change in the system’s security boundaries.\n\nConfidentiality (C): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not allow disclosure of sensitive data. It enables unauthorized actions (like making requests on behalf of users), but there is no leakage of confidential information such as passwords or private keys.\n\nIntegrity (I): High (H)  \nJustification: The attacker can forge requests using stolen or manipulated CSRF tokens, thereby altering the state of the application (e.g., changing user preferences, performing transactions). This directly compromises data integrity by allowing unauthorized modifications.\n\nAvailability (A): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability does not cause denial-of-service or disruption of service. The application remains available; the issue is about unauthorized actions rather than resource exhaustion or outages.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

Fix this use-after-free issue by dropping of_node_put() in adv7533_parse_dt() and calling of_node_put() in error path of probe() and also in the remove().\n", "response": "The CVE describes a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem, specifically in the `adv7533_attach_dsi()` function. The issue arises because a pointer (`host_node`) is allocated and then freed in `adv7533_parse_dt()`, but later used in `adv7533_attach_dsi()`. This leads to a potential memory corruption if an attacker can trigger the execution of `adv7533_attach_dsi()` after the free operation.\n\nLet’s analyze each CVSS v3.1 base metric based on the nature of the vulnerability:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**: **Network (N)**  \nJustification: The vulnerability exists in a kernel driver component that handles device tree parsing and DSI (Display Serial Interface) attachment. It does not directly expose a network service or require external input over a network. However, exploitation would likely occur through a maliciously crafted device tree (DTB) during system boot or driver initialization — which is typically delivered via firmware or hardware configuration. While not strictly network-based, such attacks often involve indirect access via device-specific configurations. Still, since no direct network communication is involved, and the attack surface is internal to the kernel via device tree processing, the most accurate classification remains **Adjacent (A)** — because the exploit requires interaction with the system's device tree (a part of the system image loaded at boot). However, given that the flaw is in a kernel module handling hardware-specific data, and there's no remote access required, **Local (L)** might seem plausible. But the actual exploitation requires manipulation of the device tree, which is part of the system's local configuration and loaded locally. Therefore, the correct vector is **Local (L)** — the attacker needs local access to modify or trigger the faulty code path (e.g., via a malformed DTB).  \n✅ Final choice: **L**\n\n> Correction: Though device trees are part of the system, the vulnerability is triggered when the kernel processes them during early boot — requiring local control over the system or firmware. No remote access needed. So, **Local (L)** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: **High (H)**  \nJustification: Exploiting a use-after-free requires precise timing and knowledge of the internal memory layout and object lifecycle. The attacker must be able to manipulate the device tree (or firmware) to cause the kernel to call `adv7533_attach_dsi()` after the `host", "prediction": "X", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

This occurs over the network via a web interface. Attackers do not need physical access or local system interaction.  \n  → Value: **Network (N)**  \n  Justification: The attack is delivered over the network via a web-based interface where an attacker can craft malicious content that is rendered to users.\n\n- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability exists due to improper sanitization of file content; no complex conditions or deep configuration are required. An attacker can exploit it with minimal effort using a simple crafted payload.  \n  → Value: **Low (L)**  \n  Justification: Exploitation requires little technical skill or setup—only a basic understanding of how to inject script tags into file content.\n\n- **Privileges Required (PR)**: No authentication is needed to trigger the XSS. The vulnerability affects public-facing content rendering, meaning anyone can observe and interact with the page.  \n  → Value: **None (N)**  \n  Justification: The flaw does not require login or administrative privileges to be exploited.\n\n- **User Interaction (UI)**: The victim must open a page containing the malicious content (e.g., a file link). Thus, user action is required to execute the script.  \n  → Value: **Required (R)**  \n  Justification: The attacker cannot automatically perform actions on behalf of the user; the user must visit a page with the malicious content for the script to run.\n\n- **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability is limited to the web interface and does not affect internal components or system functionality beyond what's exposed in the UI. There is no indication of lateral movement or impact on backend systems.  \n  → Value: **Unchanged (U)**  \n  Justification: The issue is confined to the rendering layer and does not extend to other parts of the application or infrastructure.\n\n- **Confidentiality (C)**: XSS can steal sensitive information such as cookies, session tokens, or authentication details when injected into a page viewed by others.

To properly release it, we should call r8712_free_io_queue() in r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit(). Besides, in r871xu_dev_remove(), r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() will be called by r871x_dev_unload() under condition `padapter->bup` and r8712_free_io_queue() is called by r8712_free_drv_sw(). However, r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() does not rely on `padapter->bup` and calling r8712_free_io_queue() in r8712_free_drv_sw() is negative for better understading the code. So I move r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() into r871xu_dev_remove(), and remove r8712_free_io_queue() from r8712_free_drv_sw().\n", "response": "The CVE describes a memory leak issue in the Linux kernel's RTL8712 wireless driver, specifically in the `r871xu_drv_init()` function. If `r8712_init_drv_sw()` fails, memory allocated via `r8712_alloc_io_queue()` is not properly freed because `r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit()` is not called, and the cleanup logic is missing. The fix involves moving the deinit call into `r871xu_dev_remove()` to ensure proper resource release.\n\nThis is a **memory leak** — a type of bug where resources (in this case, dynamically allocated memory) are not freed when they should be. Memory leaks do not directly compromise confidentiality, integrity, or availability in the traditional sense; however, over time, they can degrade system performance and potentially lead to denial-of-service conditions due to exhaustion of available memory.\n\nLet’s analyze each CVSS v3.1 base metric based on the nature of the vulnerability:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**: *Network (N)*  \nJustification: This is a kernel-level memory leak in a device driver used by network hardware (RTL8712 Wi-Fi). An attacker would need to exploit the driver through a maliciously crafted packet or interface interaction, which typically occurs at the network layer. While direct exploitation may require physical access or local privilege escalation, the vulnerability exists within a network-facing component. Since the flaw is in a driver that handles USB/WiFi traffic, the attack vector is primarily network-based. Thus, AV = N.\n\n---\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: *High (H)*  \nJustification: Exploiting a memory leak requires triggering specific conditions during initialization (e.g., failure of `r8712_init_drv_sw()`), which likely needs precise input or timing. The vulnerability is not easily triggered and depends on the driver's internal flow. There is no indication of a simple or automated exploit path. Therefore, successful exploitation requires significant effort and knowledge of the driver internals, making the complexity high. AC = H.\n\n---\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**: *None (N)*  \nJustification: The vulnerability arises in a driver context that could be accessed via normal user-space interaction (e.g., loading a module or using WiFi drivers). However, memory leaks in kernel modules are often exploitable only when the driver is loaded and active. But since the issue is a memory leak rather than a direct privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution", "prediction": "X", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts through publicly accessible pages via a shortcode. Since the attack occurs over the network and does not require physical access or direct system interaction, the attack vector is Network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the exploit targets a specific input field, successful exploitation requires the attacker to craft and submit malicious content through a user-supplied attribute. The victim must visit a page containing the injected script, which implies that the attacker needs to gain contributor-level access and then ensure the payload is rendered in a way that executes upon user interaction—this involves multiple steps and careful crafting, indicating high complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): Low (L)  \nJustification: The vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated users with contributor-level access or higher.

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `informacao_adicional.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `descricao` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `informacao_adicional.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed, the malicious payload is executed in the victim's browser, potentially compromising the user's data and system. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.6 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts via the `descricao` parameter over the network. Since the attack can be initiated remotely through HTTP requests, the attack vector is network-based.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the vulnerability exists due to improper input sanitization, exploitation requires that an attacker first craft and send a malicious script payload to the target server.

A vulnerability has been identified in the ORC C++ LZO decompression logic, where specially crafted malformed ORC files can cause the decompressor to allocate a 250-byte buffer but then attempts to copy 295 bytes into it. It causes memory corruption. This issue affects Apache ORC C++ library: through 1.8.8, from 1.9.0 through 1.9.5, from 2.0.0 through 2.0.4, from 2.1.0 through 2.1.1.

There's no indication of requiring physical access or direct local exploitation.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the vulnerability involves a heap-based buffer overflow, exploiting it requires crafting a specifically designed, malformed ORC file that triggers the overflow. Such precise manipulation makes the attack complex; an attacker would need knowledge of the internal structure of the ORC format and the decompression logic to create a valid payload. This level of precision constitutes high attack complexity.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows execution via untrusted input (malformed ORC file).

This lingering reference comes from a secpath (which holds a ref on the xfrm_state), which is still attached to an skb. This skb is not leaked, it ends up on sk_receive_queue and then gets defer-free'd by skb_attempt_defer_free. The problem happens when we defer freeing an skb (push it on one CPU's defer_list), and don't flush that list before the netns is deleted. In that case, we still have a reference on the xfrm_state that we don't expect at this point. We already drop the skb's dst in the TCP receive path when it's no longer needed, so let's also drop the secpath. At this point, tcp_filter has already called into the LSM hooks that may require the secpath, so it should not be needed anymore. However, in some of those places, the MPTCP extension has just been attached to the skb, so we cannot simply drop all extensions.\n", "response": "The provided CVE description describes a memory management issue in the Linux kernel’s TCP stack related to improper handling of `secpath` and `xfrm_state` references during network namespace deletion. Specifically, a lingering reference to an `xfrm_state` object persists due to a `secpath` being attached to an `skb`, which remains in the receive queue and is deferred for free. When the network namespace is deleted, the `secpath` is not dropped immediately, leading to a dangling reference — though no direct data corruption or system crash is mentioned, the issue involves a potential integrity and availability concern via resource leakage.\n\nLet’s analyze each CVSS v3.1 base metric based on the nature of the vulnerability:\n\n---\n\n**Attack Vector (AV)**: *Network (N)*  \nJustification: The vulnerability arises in the TCP/IP stack during normal network operations involving packet processing and network namespace teardown. An attacker would need to trigger specific network traffic patterns (e.g., creating netns pairs, using IP-comp6, sending TCP packets) over the network. There is no indication of physical access or local exploitability; the attack requires network-level interaction.\n\n---\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: *High (H)*  \nJustification: Exploiting this vulnerability requires precise coordination of actions such as creating multiple network namespaces, setting up IP-comp6 tunnels, triggering TCP connections, and managing lifecycle of SKBs and xfrm states. These conditions are non-trivial to reproduce and require deep knowledge of Linux networking internals. No simple or automated exploitation path exists — thus, high complexity.\n\n---\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**: *None (N)*  \nJustification: The vulnerability occurs in the kernel’s standard TCP processing path. While it may be triggered under certain network configurations, there is no requirement for elevated privileges (like root or kernel module loading). A regular user could potentially trigger the scenario if they can control network traffic and manage network namespaces (e.g., via `unshare` or `ip netns`). However, since the issue stems from normal operation and does not require privilege escalation, and given that the bug is in a public-facing component, it is reasonable to assign **None**.\n\n> Note: Although network namespace manipulation might require some level of privilege, the core flaw is in how the kernel handles deferred frees and references during netns deletion — a behavior that can be triggered through legitimate network operations. Thus, no special privileges beyond normal process execution are required.\n\n---\n\n**User Interaction (UI)**: *Required (R)*", "prediction": "X", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it is possible for any authenticated user, through the use of the filemanager to delete any file owned by the user running the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) on the host without any limitation on the filesystem's scope. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to arbitrarily remove content from the Wiki resulting in partial loss of data and defacement/deterioration of the website. In the context of a container installation of YesWiki without any modification, the `yeswiki` files (for example .php) are not owned by the same user (root) as the one running the FPM process (www-data). However in a standard installation, www-data may also be the owner of the PHP files, allowing a malicious user to completely cut the access to the wiki by deleting all important PHP files (like index.php or core files of YesWiki). Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for this issue.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability is exploitable via the file manager interface, which is accessible over the network.

This issue is fixed in macOS Sequoia 15.3, iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3. An app may be able to view a contact's phone number in system logs.\n", "response": "The CVE describes a privacy issue where an application may be able to view a contact’s phone number in system logs due to insufficient private data redaction. This indicates that sensitive personal information (a contact’s phone number) could be exposed in log entries, potentially allowing unauthorized access to private data.\n\nLet’s analyze each base metric based on the described vulnerability:\n\n- **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability involves system logs accessible to apps. Logs are typically available over the network or via system-level access; however, since the exposure occurs through system logs which can be accessed by applications running with certain privileges, the attack vector is most appropriately classified as **Network (N)** because the exposure happens via system logging mechanisms that can be observed remotely or through process monitoring. However, given that the issue arises from poor redaction within logs and not direct remote exploitation, and since apps can read logs (which are stored locally but accessible via system interfaces), the actual access path is more local than network-based. But in practice, such log exposures are often considered **Local (L)** if the attacker needs to run an app with access to logs. However, since the app itself is reading logs — and apps are generally not privileged to access logs directly unless they have specific permissions — this suggests the exploit requires local execution or privilege escalation. Still, the key point is that the data leakage occurs in system logs, which are accessible to any app with appropriate context. Given that the app is already part of the system environment, the attack vector is best interpreted as **Local (L)** because the attacker must be within the same system (e.g., a malicious app).  \n→ Chosen value: **L** (Local) – The app must be installed or running on the device to access logs, implying local access.\n\n- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability stems from inadequate redaction of private data in logs. There is no indication of complex conditions or multi-step actions required. Once the app has access to logs (via normal system behavior), it can simply read them. No additional configuration or interaction beyond existing app functionality is needed.  \n→ Chosen value: **L** (Low) – The flaw is exploitable with minimal effort once the app has access.\n\n- **Privileges Required (PR)**: The app must already be installed and running on the device. It does not require elevated user privileges (like admin rights) to access logs — standard app access to logs is sufficient. Therefore, no special privileges are needed beyond what typical apps have.  \n→", "prediction": "X", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "score": 0.0, "success": false}

An attacker can exploit this by injecting malicious scripts into user inputs that are then rendered on the website, which is accessible over the network. There is no need for physical access or local compromise; exploitation occurs remotely over the network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  \nJustification: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities typically require minimal complexity to exploit—attackers simply inject script payloads into fields such as form inputs or URLs. Since the input is directly processed and reflected in the output without proper sanitization, the attack does not require sophisticated techniques or deep knowledge of system internals.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows stored XSS, meaning an attacker can inject malicious scripts that are saved and executed when other users visit the affected page. No authentication or administrative privileges are required to exploit this flaw. Any user visiting the site can be impacted if they view content containing the injected script.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: Although the payload is stored and later executed, the victim must actively interact with the application (e.g., load the page containing the malicious script) for the attack to succeed.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SVG content, which can execute arbitrary JavaScript code when viewed by an admin, potentially leading to credential theft.\n", "response": "Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious SVG content via user input that is transmitted over the network (e.g., through a web interface). Since the attack occurs over the network and does not require physical access or direct system interaction, the attack vector is Network.\n\nAttack Complexity (AC): High (H)  \nJustification: While the vulnerability involves user input injection, exploiting it requires careful crafting of SVG content containing JavaScript payloads. The victim (admin) must view the content for execution, and the payload may need to be embedded in a way that bypasses basic filtering—this implies non-trivial effort and complexity, thus qualifying as High.\n\nPrivileges Required (PR): None (N)  \nJustification: The vulnerability is triggered by user input in a public-facing chatbot feature. There is no requirement for authentication or elevated privileges; an unauthenticated attacker can submit malicious SVG content, making Privileges Required = None.\n\nUser Interaction (UI): Required (R)  \nJustification: The malicious SVG script will only execute when an administrator views the content.

If the allocation fails, the system continues execution with an uninitialised pointer. However, such failure is likely to happen under specific, predictable conditions (e.g., memory exhaustion or misconfiguration), and there is no indication of complex interaction required.  \n→ **High (H)**  \nJustification: While the condition may seem simple, triggering the failure requires a specific scenario (e.g., a malformed RPC request or resource exhaustion), and the attack is not trivially exploitable. The lack of direct exploitability due to control flow constraints implies high complexity in exploitation.\n\n---\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**  \nThis is a kernel-level vulnerability.

The fix involves handling the NULL case to prevent the crash.\n\nLet’s analyze the base metrics based on standard CVSS v3.1 interpretation principles:\n\n- **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel, which is exposed over the network via device drivers used by ARM-based platforms (e.g., in embedded systems). However, the issue arises from improper NULL handling in a driver function that may be invoked during system diagnostics or debugging. There is no indication of remote exploitability; the attack would require interaction with the system through a local interface (e.g., via a debug tool or kernel module loading). Therefore, the attack vector is **Local (L)** — an attacker needs physical access or local privilege to trigger the issue.\n\n  → Chosen value: **L**  \n  Justification: The vulnerability occurs within a kernel driver component that is accessed locally and does not expose a network-facing service. Exploitation requires direct interaction with the system at the kernel level.\n\n- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability is a simple NULL pointer dereference due to unhandled NULL returns. It is a straightforward logic error that could be triggered under normal execution paths (e.g., when calling `vchiq_get_state()` with invalid input). No complex conditions or side-channel attacks are involved. Thus, the complexity is low.\n\n  → Chosen value: **L**  \n  Justification: The flaw is easily exploitable due to its nature — a missing NULL check in a routine that can be called under typical operation.\n\n- **Privileges Required (PR)**: To access the kernel driver (`vchiq_arm`) and invoke functions like `vchiq_get_state`, the attacker would need kernel-level privileges (e.g., root access or elevated permissions).

While reading icmp sysctl variables, they can be changed concurrently. So, we need to add READ_ONCE() to avoid data-races.\n", "response": "The CVE description states that the vulnerability is related to a data race in the ICMP subsystem of the Linux kernel when reading sysctl variables. Specifically, concurrent access to these variables can lead to inconsistent reads due to lack of synchronization (e.g., missing `READ_ONCE()`). This is a concurrency issue affecting kernel-level sysctls during read operations.\n\nLet’s analyze each base metric based on standard CVSS v3.1 interpretation principles:\n\n- **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability exists in the kernel's system call interface (sysctl) used by userspace tools to query kernel parameters. An attacker would need to trigger this via a user-space application or network-based interaction. However, since the issue arises from concurrent access within kernel code and does not require exploitation through a remote service or network attack, but rather depends on timing and access to kernel internals, the most appropriate vector is **Network (N)** because the sysctl interface is accessible over network (via netlink or other mechanisms) and could be triggered remotely. Still, note that direct exploitation may require local access. But given that sysctls are typically accessed via network or process calls, and no specific privilege escalation path is described, **AV:N** is reasonable.  \n  → Chosen: **N**\n\n- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability involves a data race — two threads accessing shared memory simultaneously. This requires precise timing and coordination between processes (e.g., multiple processes reading sysctl at once). Such scenarios are relatively rare and require predictable conditions. Therefore, the attack complexity is considered **High (H)** because an attacker cannot easily exploit this without knowing the timing or having control over concurrent access patterns.  \n  → Chosen: **H**\n\n- **Privileges Required (PR)**: The affected function (`sysctl`) is part of the kernel and can be accessed by processes with sufficient privileges. However, reading sysctl values generally does not require root; many sysctls are readable by regular users. Thus, the vulnerability can be exploited without elevated privileges.  \n  → Chosen: **N**\n\n- **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability occurs during normal operation when multiple processes read sysctl values concurrently. No explicit user action (like clicking a button or entering input) is required. It is a race condition that happens automatically under load.  \n  → Chosen: **N**\n\n- **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability is confined to the ICMP subsystem and does not affect other parts of the kernel or system functionality.

However, in SQLi cases where the input is part of a public endpoint, and the attacker controls the input, user interaction is not strictly required. In fact, the attacker can directly inject payloads via a direct request. Therefore, **UI = N** is more accurate.
