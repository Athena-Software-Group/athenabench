Once the attacker's MAC address is connected to an authentic IP address, the attacker can begin receiving any data that is intended for that IP address. \n\nThe best mitigation for this type of attack is to enable DHCP Snooping and Dynamic ARP Inspection on switches. DHCP Snooping is a security feature that provides security by filtering untrusted DHCP messages. Dynamic ARP inspection (DAI) is a security feature that validates ARP packets in a network. DAI intercepts, logs, and discards ARP packets with invalid IP-to-MAC address bindings.
