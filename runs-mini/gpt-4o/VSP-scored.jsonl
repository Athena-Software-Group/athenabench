Prior to version 25.4.0, the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently, conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization, which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result, the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions, conda-build creates a potential execution pathway for malicious code, violating security assumptions.

This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.\n", "response": "To analyze the CVE description and calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we need to evaluate each base metric based on the provided information.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**\n   - The vulnerability involves cross-site scripting (XSS) in a web UI, which can be exploited over a network. Therefore, the attack vector is Network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**\n   - Stored XSS typically does not require any special conditions beyond the ability to inject the script, making the attack complexity low.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR): Low (L)**\n   - The description suggests that users can embed JavaScript code, implying that some level of access is needed to perform the injection. However, it does not specify that high privileges are required, so Low is appropriate.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI): Required (R)**\n   - For stored XSS, the victim must interact with the malicious script, typically by visiting a page where the script is executed. Therefore, user interaction is required.\n\n5. **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)**\n   - The impact of the vulnerability is within the same security scope (the web application), as it involves executing scripts in the context of the user's session.

However, this approach created a race condition between the DRM scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence is signaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed. This results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns a new job to the pointer. This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns it to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an interrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.

It triggers a NULL pointer dereference in the periodic tick code. This happens because the legacy timer interrupt (IRQ0) is resent in software which happens in soft interrupt (tasklet) context. In this context get_irq_regs() returns NULL which leads to the NULL pointer dereference. The reason for the resend is a spurious APIC interrupt on the IRQ0 vector which is captured and leads to a resend when the legacy timer interrupt is enabled. This is wrong because the legacy PIC interrupts are level triggered and therefore should never be resent in software, but nothing ever sets the IRQ_LEVEL flag on those interrupts, so the core code does not know about their trigger type.

Add a null point check to avoid the Kernel Oops.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to evaluate each base metric based on the information provided.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**\n   - Justification: The vulnerability involves inserting a USB dongle, which suggests physical access is required. However, since the vulnerability is in the Bluetooth stack, it could potentially be exploited over a network if the Bluetooth device is exposed. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is Network (N).\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**\n   - Justification: The description suggests that the vulnerability can be triggered by inserting a USB dongle with a specific chip, indicating that the attack does not require any special conditions beyond having the device. Thus, the complexity is Low (L).\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)**\n   - Justification: The description does not mention any requirement for privileges to exploit the vulnerability. The attack seems to occur simply by inserting a USB dongle, suggesting no privileges are needed. Therefore, Privileges Required is None (N).\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI): None (N)**\n   - Justification: The vulnerability is triggered by inserting a USB dongle, which does not require any additional user interaction beyond the initial insertion. Thus, User Interaction is None (N).\n\n5. **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)**\n   - Justification: The vulnerability results in a Kernel Oops, which affects the availability of the system but does not imply a change in scope, such as affecting other systems or components. Therefore, Scope is Unchanged (U).\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C): None (N)**\n   - Justification: The description does not indicate any impact on confidentiality. The issue seems to be related to system stability (Kernel Oops) rather than data exposure. Thus, Confidentiality is None (N).\n\n7. **Integrity (I): None (N)**\n   - Justification: There is no indication that the vulnerability affects the integrity of the system or data. The primary impact is on system availability. Therefore, Integrity is None (N).\n\n8. **Availability (A): High (H)**\n   - Justification: The vulnerability leads to a Kernel Oops, which can cause a system crash or denial of service. This has a significant impact on availability, so Availability is High (H).\n\nBased on the above analysis, the CVSS v3.1 vector string is constructed as follows:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

It was found from vmcore that perf had registered two ops with the same content successively, both dynamic. After unregistering the second ops, a use-after-free occurred. In ftrace_shutdown(), when the second ops is unregistered, the FTRACE_UPDATE_CALLS command is not set because there is another enabled ops with the same content. Also, both ops are dynamic and the ftrace callback function is ftrace_ops_list_func, so the FTRACE_UPDATE_TRACE_FUNC command will not be set. Eventually the value of 'command' will be 0 and ftrace_shutdown() will skip the rcu synchronization. However, ftrace may be activated. When the ops is released, another CPU may be accessing the ops. Add the missing synchronization to fix this problem.

This can cause a deadlock in the scenario reported by syz-bot below: CPU0 CPU1 CPU2 ---- ---- ---- lock(console_owner); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(console_owner); As commit dbdda842fe96 (\"printk: Add console owner and waiter logic to load balance console writes\") said, such deadlock can be prevented by using printk_deferred() in kmalloc() (which is invoked in the section guarded by the port->lock). But there are too many printk() on the kmalloc() path, and kmalloc() can be called from anywhere, so changing printk() to printk_deferred() is too complicated and inelegant. Therefore, this patch chooses to specify __GFP_NOWARN to kmalloc(), so that printk() will not be called, and this deadlock problem can be avoided.

Such deadlock can happen in the following situation. When all journal buckets are fully filled by active jset with heavy write I/O load, the cache set registration (after a reboot) will load all active jsets and inserting them into the btree again (which is called journal replay). If a journaled bkey is inserted into a btree node and results btree node split, new journal request might be triggered. For example, the btree grows one more level after the node split, then the root node record in cache device super block will be upgrade by bch_journal_meta() from bch_btree_set_root(). But there is no space in journal buckets, the journal replay has to wait for new journal bucket to be reclaimed after at least one journal bucket replayed. This is one example that how the journal no-space deadlock happens. The solution to avoid the deadlock is to reserve 1 journal bucket in run time, and only permit the reserved journal bucket to be used during cache set registration procedure for things like journal replay. Then the journal space will never be fully filled, there is no chance for journal no-space deadlock to happen anymore. This patch adds a new member \"bool do_reserve\" in struct journal, it is inititalized to 0 (false) when struct journal is allocated, and set to 1 (true) by bch_journal_space_reserve() when all initialization done in run_cache_set(). In the run time when journal_reclaim() tries to allocate a new journal bucket, free_journal_buckets() is called to check whether there are enough free journal buckets to use. If there is only 1 free journal bucket and journal->do_reserve is 1 (true), the last bucket is reserved and free_journal_buckets() will return 0 to indicate no free journal bucket. Then journal_reclaim() will give up, and try next time to see whetheer there is free journal bucket to allocate. By this method, there is always 1 jouranl bucket reserved in run time. During the cache set registration, journal->do_reserve is 0 (false), so the reserved journal bucket can be used to avoid the no-space deadlock.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to evaluate each base metric based on the information provided:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV): Local (L)**\n   - The vulnerability involves the Linux kernel's bcache subsystem and appears to require local access to exploit, as it involves cache set registration and journal replay processes.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC): High (H)**\n   - The description suggests a specific set of conditions and a complex sequence of operations (e.g., journal replay, btree node split) that must occur for the deadlock to happen, indicating a high level of complexity.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR): Low (L)**\n   - The operations described (e.g., cache set registration, journal replay) likely require some level of privileges, but not necessarily administrative or root privileges, suggesting low privileges are sufficient.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI): None (N)**\n   - The vulnerability does not require any user interaction once the conditions are met, as it is related to internal kernel operations.\n\n5. **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)**\n   - The vulnerability affects the same security scope (i.e., the kernel's internal operations) and does not appear to impact other components or systems.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C): None (N)**\n   - The vulnerability description does not indicate any impact on confidentiality.\n\n7. **Integrity (I): None (N)**\n   - There is no indication that the vulnerability affects data integrity.\n\n8. **Availability (A): High (H)**\n   - The vulnerability can lead to a deadlock, which is a significant availability impact, as it can cause the system to become unresponsive.\n\nBased on these assessments, the CVSS v3.1 vector string is constructed as follows:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.7999999999999998, "success": true}

A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request).\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to evaluate each base metric:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**\n   - The attack can be performed over the network by controlling content on the target site or a subdomain, which aligns with the Network vector.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**\n   - The attack does not require any special conditions or circumstances beyond controlling content on the target site or subdomain, making it low complexity.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)**\n   - The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system to exploit this vulnerability, as they can control content via XSS or similar means.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI): Required (R)**\n   - The attack requires user interaction, as the attacker needs the user to visit a malicious page or interact with content controlled by the attacker.\n\n5. **Scope (S): Changed (C)**\n   - The vulnerability allows the attacker to affect resources beyond the vulnerable component (e.g., manipulating cookies and issuing requests on behalf of the user), indicating a change in scope.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C): High (H)**\n   - The attacker can acquire the secret CSRF token from the cookie, which is a significant breach of confidentiality.\n\n7. **Integrity (I): High (H)**\n   - The attacker can manipulate cookies and issue requests on behalf of the user, significantly impacting the integrity of the system.\n\n8. **Availability (A): None (N)**\n   - There is no indication that the vulnerability affects the availability of the system.\n\nBased on these evaluations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string is constructed as follows:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 3.200000000000001, "success": true}

The CVE describes a potential memory leak in the Linux kernel's staging driver for rtl8712, which is a software issue related to resource management.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV): Local (L)**\n   - The vulnerability is related to a memory leak in a driver initialization function, which typically requires local access to the system to exploit. Therefore, the attack vector is Local.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**\n   - The issue is a straightforward memory leak due to improper resource deallocation. Exploiting this type of vulnerability generally does not require special conditions or complex attack methods, so the complexity is Low.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR): Low (L)**\n   - Exploiting a driver-related memory leak might require some level of privileges, such as user-level access to load or interact with the driver. Therefore, Privileges Required is Low.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI): None (N)**\n   - The vulnerability does not require any user interaction to be exploited once the attacker has the necessary privileges to execute the driver code. Thus, User Interaction is None.\n\n5. **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)**\n   - The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the kernel and its memory management) and does not lead to a broader impact on other components or systems. Therefore, the scope is Unchanged.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C): None (N)**\n   - A memory leak typically does not directly impact confidentiality, as it does not expose sensitive information. Thus, the Confidentiality impact is None.\n\n7. **Integrity (I): None (N)**\n   - The vulnerability does not directly affect the integrity of the system or data, as it is related to resource management rather than data manipulation. Therefore, Integrity impact is None.\n\n8. **Availability (A): Low (L)**\n   - A memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion over time, potentially affecting system availability.

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `informacao_adicional.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `descricao` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `informacao_adicional.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed, the malicious payload is executed in the victim's browser, potentially compromising the user's data and system. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.6 and all users are advised to upgrade.

This lingering reference comes from a secpath (which holds a ref on the xfrm_state), which is still attached to an skb. This skb is not leaked, it ends up on sk_receive_queue and then gets defer-free'd by skb_attempt_defer_free. The problem happens when we defer freeing an skb (push it on one CPU's defer_list), and don't flush that list before the netns is deleted. In that case, we still have a reference on the xfrm_state that we don't expect at this point. We already drop the skb's dst in the TCP receive path when it's no longer needed, so let's also drop the secpath. At this point, tcp_filter has already called into the LSM hooks that may require the secpath, so it should not be needed anymore.

In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it is possible for any authenticated user, through the use of the filemanager to delete any file owned by the user running the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) on the host without any limitation on the filesystem's scope. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to arbitrarily remove content from the Wiki resulting in partial loss of data and defacement/deterioration of the website. In the context of a container installation of YesWiki without any modification, the `yeswiki` files (for example .php) are not owned by the same user (root) as the one running the FPM process (www-data). However in a standard installation, www-data may also be the owner of the PHP files, allowing a malicious user to completely cut the access to the wiki by deleting all important PHP files (like index.php or core files of YesWiki). Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for this issue.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to evaluate each base metric:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV): Local (L)**\n   - The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the system where YesWiki is installed, as it involves file manipulation on the host filesystem.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**\n   - The attack does not require any special conditions beyond having access to the file manager as an authenticated user.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR): Low (L)**\n   - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, which implies low privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI): None (N)**\n   - Once the attacker has access to the file manager, no further user interaction is needed to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n5. **Scope (S): Changed (C)**\n   - The vulnerability allows the attacker to affect resources beyond their own privileges, such as deleting files owned by the web server process, which changes the scope of impact.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C): Low (L)**\n   - The vulnerability allows for the deletion of files, which may lead to some loss of confidentiality if sensitive files are deleted, but it is not the primary impact.\n\n7. **Integrity (I): High (H)**\n   - The ability to delete files can lead to significant integrity issues, such as defacement or deterioration of the website.\n\n8. **Availability (A): High (H)**\n   - Deleting critical files like `index.php` can render the application unusable, leading to a complete loss of availability.\n\nBased on these metrics, the CVSS v3.1 vector string is:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H", "score": 1.5999999999999996, "success": true}
