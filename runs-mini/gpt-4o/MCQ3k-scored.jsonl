This results in the linking of an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. Detecting gratuitous ARP replies and multiple IPs mapping to a single MAC address are indicators of such an attack.\n\nTo mitigate ARP poisoning, network security measures should be implemented that specifically address the manipulation of ARP messages. DHCP Snooping and Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) are two such features that can be enabled on network switches to prevent ARP spoofing. DHCP Snooping ensures that only trusted DHCP servers can assign IP addresses, while DAI inspects ARP packets and ensures that they are consistent with the DHCP Snooping database, thus preventing ARP spoofing attacks.\n\nOption A, \"Enable DHCP Snooping and Dynamic ARP Inspection on switches,\" directly addresses the issue of ARP poisoning by providing mechanisms to validate ARP packets and prevent unauthorized ARP replies, making it the best choice for mitigating this threat.\n\nAnswer: A", "prediction": "A", "answer": "A", "score": 1, "success": true}

Specifically, it permits events to be matched in a general phase order, meaning that while the sequence of events should generally follow a logical progression, there can be intervening events that do not disrupt the overall pattern. This flexibility is crucial for accurately modeling adversary behavior, which may not always follow a strict sequence but still maintains a recognizable order of phases.\n\nAnswer: B", "prediction": "B", "answer": "B", "score": 1, "success": true}

The CSF Tiers are specifically designed to provide context on how an organization views cybersecurity risk and the processes in place to manage that risk. They range from Partial (Tier 1) to Adaptive (Tier 4) and help organizations understand their current risk management practices and how they can improve them.

The most appropriate approach is to have a single designated point of contact (POC) who can communicate with the most appropriate agency.

This ensures that operational decisions align with the organization's policies, risk tolerance, and business objectives. \n\nOption A, where the MSSP disconnects systems at will, would not be appropriate as it gives too much control to the MSSP without organizational oversight. Option C, where the MSSP handles media relations and breach notifications, is not typically within the scope of an MSSP's responsibilities. Option D, where the MSSP maintains all server logs and withholds them, would prevent the organization from having necessary visibility and control over its own data. Option E, where the MSSP manages HR investigations, is outside the typical scope of an MSSP's role and involves sensitive internal matters.\n\nOption B is the most appropriate division of responsibilities. It allows the MSSP to use its expertise to detect and analyze security activity and provide informed recommendations, while the internal team retains the authority to make operational decisions. This ensures that decisions are made in the context of the organization's specific needs and constraints.\n\nAnswer: B", "prediction": "B", "answer": "B", "score": 1, "success": true}
