This attribution is based on several key factors:\n\n1. **Geographic and Targeting Focus**: The group is Pakistan-linked and targets South Asian countries, particularly Indian defense and government entities, which aligns with Transparent Tribe's known focus.\n\n2. **Infection Chain and Techniques**: The use of spear-phishing with LNK files and HTA scripts for initial access is consistent with Transparent Tribe's tactics. They are known for using spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to deliver malware.\n\n3. **Payload and Tools**: The use of the AllaKore RAT, a Delphi-based RAT, is a tool associated with Transparent Tribe. The RAT's capabilities for system information gathering, file operations, and keylogging are typical of the group's operations.\n\n4. **Infrastructure and Campaign Patterns**: The use of compromised domains and infrastructure for hosting payloads and C2 servers, as well as the observed campaign activity spikes, are consistent with Transparent Tribe's operational patterns.\n\n5. **Decoy Documents**: The use of decoy documents related to Indian defense topics is a known tactic of Transparent Tribe to lure targets into executing their malware.\n\nAnswer: Transparent Tribe", "prediction": "Transparent Tribe", "answer": "SideCopy", "score": {"correct": 0, "plausible": 1, "combined": 0.5}, "success": true}
