A memory leak vulnerability was identified in the `crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability can lead to resource exhaustion and degraded system performance over time, particularly in long-running processes or systems processing large volumes of data. The vulnerability is present in the `crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter` function within `crypto_tc.c`. The function allocates memory using `malloc` without ensuring the allocated memory is always freed. This issue can lead to resource exhaustion, reduced system performance, and potentially a Denial of Service (DoS) in environments where CryptoLib is used in long-running processes or with large volumes of data. Any system using CryptoLib, especially those handling high-throughput or continuous data streams, could be impacted.

Prior to 6.6.10.3 or 6.5.8.17, the default settings for double-opt-in allow for mass unsolicited newsletter sign-ups without confirmation. Default settings are Newsletter: Double Opt-in set to active, Newsletter: Double opt-in for registered customers set to disabled, and Log-in & sign-up: Double opt-in on sign-up set to disabled. With these settings, anyone can register an account on the shop using any e-mail-address and then check the check-box in the account page to sign up for the newsletter. The recipient will receive two mails confirming registering and signing up for the newsletter, no confirmation link needed to be clicked for either. In the backend the recipient is set to “instantly active”. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.6.10.3 or 6.5.8.17.\n", "response": "The root cause of this vulnerability is the system's failure to verify the user's control over an email address before performing the sensitive action of subscribing it to a newsletter.

Multiple evaluation of a single expression is possible in the iterator target of a for loop. While the iterator expression cannot produce multiple writes, it can consume side effects produced in the loop body (e.g. read a storage variable updated in the loop body) and thus lead to unexpected program behavior. Specifically, reads in iterators which contain an ifexp (e.g. `for s: uint256 in ([read(), read()] if True else [])`) may interleave reads with writes in the loop body. Vyper for loops allow two kinds of iterator targets, namely the `range()` builtin and an iterable type, like SArray and DArray. During codegen, iterable lists are required to not produce any side-effects (in the following code, `range_scope` forces `iter_list` to be parsed in a constant context, which is checked against `is_constant`). However, this does not prevent the iterator from consuming side effects provided by the body of the loop. For SArrays on the other hand, `iter_list` is instantiated in the body of a `repeat` ir, so it can be evaluated several times. This issue is being addressed and is expected to be available in version 0.4.1. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as the patched release is available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "response": "The root cause of this vulnerability is that the Vyper compiler generates code for `for` loops that violates the expected behavior of how an iterator should be handled. Developers implicitly expect the iterator expression to be evaluated once before the loop begins. However, in the vulnerable versions, the expression is re-evaluated on each iteration. This failure to adhere to the standard, expected semantics of a language construct is best described as an improper enforcement of a behavioral contract. The program's implementation does not match the implicit rules and expectations of the language feature, leading to unexpected and incorrect behavior when the re-evaluated expression interacts with side effects from the loop's body.\n\nAnswer: CWE-841", "prediction": "CWE-841", "answer": "CWE-662", "score": 0, "success": true}
