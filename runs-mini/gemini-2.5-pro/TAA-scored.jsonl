Olala” PowerShell executor, and PsExec. - They dumped LSASS on a KRG system on 2023-01-23. - Timeline highlights: VideoSRV on KRG (2017-09-21); RDAT on KRG (2018-01-30); custom Plink on KRG (2019-07-09); Sheep Tunneler on KRG (2021-05-01); LSASS dump (2023-01-23); Shahmaran on KRG (2023-02-01) and version 2 (2023-06-12); operator CLI commands on KRG (2023-12-14); Slippery Snakelet (2023-12-16); P.S.
