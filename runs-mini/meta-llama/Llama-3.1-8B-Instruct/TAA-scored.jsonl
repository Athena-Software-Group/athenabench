The use of spear phishing campaigns targeting activists focused on North Korea, the employment of fileless techniques, and the utilization of cloud services for C2 are all indicative of a sophisticated and well-resourced threat actor.\n\nOne notable aspect of this campaign is the use of Dropbox links delivering ZIP archives containing malicious LNK shortcut files, which execute hidden PowerShell commands. This technique has been previously associated with the APT37 group, a North Korea-state sponsored threat actor. Additionally, the use of RoKRAT as the final payload and the application of multi-stage data protection, including XOR-based decryption and AES-CBC-128 encryption, are consistent with APT37's known TTPs.\n\nFurthermore, the impersonation of South Korea-based experts and think tanks, as well as the use of Naver Mail icon imagery to disguise attachments, suggests a level of social engineering sophistication that is characteristic of APT37.

Kakao Security shows a fake system window and requests multiple permissions but lacks useful functionality. - They used Firebase Firestore to deliver an encrypted initial configuration containing an on/off switch and the C2 server address, enabling dynamic enable/disable and C2 rotation. - They performed anti-analysis by checking for emulators and enforcing a hardcoded activation date before activating spyware features. - They used a two-stage C2 scheme: HTTP POST JSON requests for “conf” (configuration) and “code” (plugin) retrieval; JSON values are encrypted and Base64-encoded with clear-text field names. - They generated a unique victim ID from hardware fingerprint and Android ID (“vtr” field) and sent device/package details, language, hardware info, and enabled permissions in a composite “pref” field. - They leveraged dynamically loaded, encrypted plugins to enable surveillance capabilities, including: SMS and call log collection; location retrieval; access to local files/folders; audio recording and camera photos; screenshots/screen recording; keystroke logging via Accessibility abuse; Wi‑Fi details collection; and installed app enumeration. - They encrypted exfiltrated data to C2 with a hardcoded AES key. - They operated multiple pieces of infrastructure: five Firebase projects and five C2 servers observed; some C2 domains were online but non-responsive during analysis. - They used developer and distribution artifacts including a Google Play listing for “File Manager” (com.file.exploer) with >10 downloads, developer name “Android Utility Developer,” email mlyqwl@gmail[.]com, privacy policy at goldensnakeblog.blogspot[.]com/2023/02/privacy-policy.html, and promotional YouTube content on @filemanager-android. - Indicators of compromise include file hashes: - 911d9f05e1c57a745cb0c669f3e1b67ac4a08601 - cd62a9ab320b4f6be49be11c9b1d2d5519cc4860 - 2d1537e92878a3a14b5b3f55b32c91b099513ae0 - f08f036a0c79a53f6b0c9ad84fb6eac1ac79c168 - df39ab90c89aa77a92295721688b18e7f1fdb38d - ea6d12e4a465a7a44cbad12659ade8a4999d64d1 - 1cc97e490b5f8a582b6b03bdba58cb5f1a389e78 - 1a167b65be75fd0651bbda072c856628973a3c1e - 985fd1f74eb617b1fea17095f9e991dcaceec170 - 744e5181e76c68b8b23a19b939942de9e1db1daa - 062a869caac496d0182decfadc57a23057caa4ab - b84604cad2f3a80fb50415aa069cce7af381e249 - 3278324744e14ddf4f4312d375f82b31026f51b5 - 5639fa1fa389ed32f8a8d1ebada8bbbe03ac5171 - Indicators of compromise include C2 domains: - joinupvts[.]org - resolveissue[.]org - crowdon[.]info - st0746[.]net - Indicators of compromise include Firebase project IDs: - mydb-a1554 - project-27ef0 - project-75f80 - smart-743cf - version-25b53\n", "response": "Based on the provided incident summary, I attribute this activity to the APT37 (also known as Thallium) threat actor group. \n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. **Targeting**: The targeting of Korean- and English-speaking users suggests a focus on South Korea, which aligns with APT37's historical targeting of South Korean organizations.\n2. **Tools and Techniques**: The use of KoSpy spyware, Firebase Firestore for delivering configurations, and a two-stage C2 scheme with HTTP POST JSON requests are all consistent with APT37's TTPs.\n3. **Infrastructure**: The operation of multiple Firebase projects and C2 servers, as well as the use of developer and distribution artifacts such as Google Play listings and YouTube promotional content, also matches APT37's modus operandi.\n4. **Anti-Analysis Techniques**: The implementation of anti-analysis measures like emulator detection and a hardcoded activation date further support the attribution to APT37, as they have demonstrated similar evasion techniques in previous operations.\n5. **Surveillance Capabilities**: The range of surveillance capabilities, including SMS and call log collection, location retrieval, and keystroke logging via Accessibility abuse, is consistent with APT37's goals of gathering sensitive information from their targets.\n\nConsidering these factors, the activity described appears to be characteristic of APT37's tactics, techniques, and procedures.\n\nAnswer: APT37", "prediction": "APT37", "answer": "APT37", "score": {"correct": 1, "plausible": 1, "combined": 1.0}, "success": true}
