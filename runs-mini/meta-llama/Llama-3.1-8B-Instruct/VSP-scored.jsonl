This issue affects Change Add to Cart Button Text for WooCommerce: from n/a through 2.2.2.\n", "response": "Based on the provided CVE description, here's my analysis of each base metric:\n\n- Attack Vector (AV): N - The vulnerability is related to an improper neutralization of input during web page generation, which typically occurs over a network. Therefore, the attack vector is likely to be Network (N).\n\n- Attack Complexity (AC): L - There is no indication that the exploitation of this vulnerability would require complex steps or specific conditions beyond the normal operation of the affected plugin. Thus, the attack complexity is considered Low (L).\n\n- Privileges Required (PR): N - Since the vulnerability is related to stored XSS, an attacker can exploit it without requiring any special privileges. Hence, the required privilege level is None (N).\n\n- User Interaction (UI): R - The vulnerability is described as Stored XSS, implying that user interaction is necessary for the payload to be injected into the system. However, since it's stored XSS, the user doesn't need to interact with the malicious content directly; rather, their interaction with the vulnerable application initially injects the payload. But considering the nature of the vulnerability, we'll consider it as 'Required' (R) because the initial interaction by the user is what leads to the injection of the malicious code.\n\n- Scope (S): U - The scope remains unchanged, as there is no indication that the vulnerability affects other components or systems beyond the Change Add to Cart Button Text for WooCommerce plugin itself.\n\n- Confidentiality (C): H - The vulnerability involves Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which primarily affects confidentiality by allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of users. Therefore, the impact on confidentiality is High (H).\n\n- Integrity (I): H - In addition to affecting confidentiality, XSS vulnerabilities can also compromise integrity by allowing attackers to modify data or manipulate user interactions. So, the impact on integrity is also High (H).\n\n- Availability (A): L - While XSS can lead to various consequences, including denial-of-service attacks, the primary concern in this case seems to be confidentiality and integrity. However, given the potential for a denial-of-service scenario due to the nature of XSS, we will assign a moderate risk to availability, making it Low (L).\n\nNow, let's summarize these values into the CVSS v3.1 vector string:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.9000000000000004, "success": true}

Prior to version 25.4.0, the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently, conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization, which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result, the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions, conda-build creates a potential execution pathway for malicious code, violating security assumptions. This issue has been patched in version 25.4.0.\n", "response": "Based on the provided CVE description, here's my analysis of the base metrics:\n\n- Attack Vector (AV): N - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network, as the issue arises from the use of `eval()` on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. This suggests that an attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted inputs to the affected system.\n  \n- Attack Complexity (AC): L - The attack complexity is considered low because the vulnerability is caused by a specific programming flaw (unsafe use of `eval()`). An attacker would not need to perform complex actions to exploit this vulnerability; they simply need to craft a malicious input that triggers the vulnerability.\n\n- Privileges Required (PR): H - To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would likely require high privileges, as they would need to manipulate the build process and execute arbitrary code within the build environment. This implies that the attacker needs elevated access to the system or the ability to inject malicious code into the build process.\n\n- User Interaction (UI): R - The vulnerability requires user interaction because the attacker would need to trick a user into executing a maliciously crafted input or injecting malicious code into the build process. This could involve social engineering tactics or exploiting another vulnerability to gain access to the build environment.\n\n- Scope (S): U - The scope remains unchanged because the vulnerability affects the build process itself, rather than introducing new functionality or modifying existing components outside of the build environment.\n\n- Confidentiality (C): H - The confidentiality impact is high because the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, which could lead to unauthorized data disclosure, modification, or destruction.\n\n- Integrity (I): H - The integrity impact is also high because the vulnerability enables an attacker to modify the build environment, potentially leading to unauthorized changes to the built package or its dependencies.\n\n- Availability (A): H - The availability impact is high because the vulnerability could cause the build process to fail or become unstable, resulting in denial-of-service conditions or other disruptions to the build environment.\n\nHere are the calculated values for each metric:\n\n- AV: N\n- AC: L\n- PR: H\n- UI: R\n- S: U\n- C: H\n- I: H\n- A: H\n\nThe complete CVSS v3.1 vector string is:\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 3.000000000000001, "success": true}

As a result, rtllib_beacons_stop() will block forever. This patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of spin_lock_irqsave(), which could let timer handler to obtain the needed lock.\n", "response": "Based on the provided CVE description, here's my analysis of the base metrics:\n\n- Attack Vector (AV): N (Network)\nThe vulnerability is located within the Linux kernel's driver code, specifically in the rtllib_beacons_stop() function. Since this is a network-related component, an attacker would likely exploit this vulnerability remotely through the network. Therefore, the attack vector is Network (N).\n\n- Attack Complexity (AC): L (Low)\nThe vulnerability involves a deadlock situation where two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. This scenario can be easily exploited by an attacker who sends malicious packets to trigger the deadlock condition. Thus, the attack complexity is considered low.\n\n- Privileges Required (PR): N (None)\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker does not require any special privileges. They can simply send malicious packets to trigger the deadlock condition, making it accessible to anyone with access to the network.\n\n- User Interaction (UI): R (Required)\nExploiting this vulnerability requires user interaction, as the attacker needs to send malicious packets to trigger the deadlock condition. Without these malicious packets, the deadlock will not occur.\n\n- Scope (S): U (Unchanged)\nThis vulnerability affects the local system, and exploitation will not spread to other systems. Therefore, the scope remains unchanged.\n\n- Confidentiality (C): H (High)\nIf an attacker successfully exploits this vulnerability, they may be able to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, potentially leading to data loss or corruption. However, since the primary impact is related to availability rather than confidentiality, I've assigned a high score for confidentiality.\n\n- Integrity (I): H (High)\nSimilar to confidentiality, if an attacker causes a DoS condition, it may lead to data corruption or integrity issues. Therefore, I've assigned a high score for integrity.\n\n- Availability (A): H (High)\nThe primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, which directly affects the availability of the system.\n\nHere's the complete CVSS v3.1 vector string:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 3.3000000000000007, "success": true}

Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /import_data_todb. The manipulation of the argument url leads to server-side request forgery. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.\n", "response": "Based on the provided CVE description, here's my analysis of each base metric:\n\n1. Attack Vector (AV):\n   Chosen Value: N (Network)\n   Justification: The vulnerability allows remote exploitation, which indicates that an attacker does not need physical access to the system or be adjacent to it. Therefore, the attack vector is network-based.\n\n2. Attack Complexity (AC):\n   Chosen Value: L (Low)\n   Justification: There is no information suggesting that the exploitation requires complex steps or specific conditions. It seems like a straightforward attack can be performed using the manipulated URL.\n\n3. Privileges Required (PR):\n   Chosen Value: N (None)\n   Justification: Since the vulnerability involves manipulating the 'url' argument, it appears that an unprivileged user could potentially exploit this issue, making no special privileges required.\n\n4. User Interaction (UI):\n   Chosen Value: R (Required)\n   Justification: Although the description mentions that the attack can be launched remotely, it specifically states that the manipulation of the 'url' argument leads to server-side request forgery. This implies that some form of interaction (e.g., clicking on a malicious link) would be necessary to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n5. Scope (S):\n   Chosen Value: U (Unchanged)\n   Justification: The description doesn't indicate that the scope of the vulnerability changes; it affects an unknown functionality within the '/import_data_todb' file.\n\n6. Confidentiality (C):\n   Chosen Value: H (High)\n   Justification: Server-side request forgery vulnerabilities often allow attackers to make unauthorized requests on behalf of the application, which could lead to sensitive data exposure or other confidentiality breaches.\n\n7. Integrity (I):\n   Chosen Value: H (High)\n   Justification: Similar to confidentiality, server-side request forgery vulnerabilities can also compromise the integrity of the system by allowing attackers to manipulate data or perform actions they shouldn't have permission to do.\n\n8.

However, this approach created a race condition between the DRM scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence is signaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed. This results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns a new job to the pointer. This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns it to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an interrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.

Therefore, the attack vector is likely **Network (N)**.\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: \nSince the vulnerability involves a specific condition where `device_register()` fails, it requires a certain level of complexity to trigger. However, given the nature of the bug, it does not seem overly complex; hence, the attack complexity is **Low (L)**.\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**: \nThis vulnerability affects the Linux kernel, which typically runs with elevated privileges. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability would also require high-level system access. Thus, the required privilege level is **High (H)**.\n\n**User Interaction (UI)**: \nThere is no indication that user interaction is necessary to trigger this vulnerability. It seems like a remote code execution scenario triggered by a failed registration process. So, the user interaction requirement is **None (N)**.\n\n**Scope (S)**: \nGiven that the vulnerability is within the Linux kernel, it primarily affects the system itself rather than changing the scope of what the system can do. Hence, the scope remains **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n**Confidentiality (C)**: \nMemory leaks often involve sensitive data exposure. In this case, if the device name allocated in `dev_set_name()` is not properly cleaned up due to a failure in `device_register()`, there could be potential confidentiality issues. Therefore, the impact on confidentiality is **High (H)**.\n\n**Integrity (I)**: \nMemory leaks can lead to integrity issues since they may allow unauthorized modifications to system resources. Given the context, the integrity impact is also **High (H)**.\n\n**Availability (A)**: \nSystem crashes or freezes caused by memory leaks can significantly affect availability. Since this vulnerability involves a memory leak, it poses a risk to system availability.

It triggers a NULL pointer dereference in the periodic tick code. This happens because the legacy timer interrupt (IRQ0) is resent in software which happens in soft interrupt (tasklet) context. In this context get_irq_regs() returns NULL which leads to the NULL pointer dereference. The reason for the resend is a spurious APIC interrupt on the IRQ0 vector which is captured and leads to a resend when the legacy timer interrupt is enabled. This is wrong because the legacy PIC interrupts are level triggered and therefore should never be resent in software, but nothing ever sets the IRQ_LEVEL flag on those interrupts, so the core code does not know about their trigger type. Ensure that IRQ_LEVEL is set when the legacy PCI interrupts are set up.\n", "response": "Based on the provided CVE description, here's my analysis of the base metrics:\n\n- Attack Vector (AV): N (Network)\nThe vulnerability is related to the Linux kernel, specifically an issue with the x86/i8259 module. Since it involves a kernel-level bug, it can potentially be exploited remotely through network attacks, such as sending malicious packets to trigger the vulnerability. Therefore, the attack vector is considered Network (N).\n\n- Attack Complexity (AC): L (Low)\nThe vulnerability requires specific conditions to occur, including a crash followed by a failure to boot the crash-kernel. However, once these conditions are met, exploiting the vulnerability appears relatively straightforward, suggesting low complexity.\n\n- Privileges Required (PR): N (None)\nTo exploit this vulnerability, no special privileges are required. An attacker would need to send a malicious packet or trigger a crash, but they wouldn't require elevated permissions to do so.\n\n- User Interaction (UI): R (Required)\nExploiting this vulnerability likely requires user interaction, as it involves triggering a crash and then observing the system's behavior during the subsequent boot process.\n\n- Scope (S): U (Unchanged)\nSince the vulnerability affects the Linux kernel, its scope remains unchanged; it doesn't introduce new functionality or modify existing ones.\n\n- Confidentiality (C): H (High)\nThis vulnerability could lead to a NULL pointer dereference, which might result in a denial-of-service condition or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Given the severity of the potential impact, confidentiality is considered high.\n\n- Integrity (I): H (High)\nSimilar to confidentiality, the integrity of the system could also be compromised due to the potential execution of arbitrary code or data corruption resulting from the NULL pointer dereference.\n\n- Availability (A): H (High)\nThe described scenario indicates that the system may fail to boot after the crash, leading to unavailability. Thus, availability is considered high.\n\nHere's the calculated CVSS v3.1 vector string:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 3.3000000000000007, "success": true}

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: \nSince the vulnerability requires a CSRF attack, which typically involves social engineering tactics like phishing emails or malicious links, the complexity of the attack is considered low. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**: \nAs the vulnerability allows an attacker to perform actions as a logged-in administrator, no additional privileges beyond what's already required for authentication are needed. Hence, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n**User Interaction (UI)**: \nFor a CSRF attack, user interaction is necessary since the attacker needs to trick the victim into performing the malicious action. Therefore, the chosen value is **Required (R)**.\n\n**Scope (S)**: \nThis vulnerability affects the application itself rather than the entire system, so the scope remains unchanged. Thus, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n**Confidentiality (C)**: \nAlthough the vulnerability is related to stored XSS payloads, there's no indication that sensitive data will be leaked or exposed. However, the impact on confidentiality might still be significant due to potential unauthorized access to administrative functions. Considering the severity, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n**Integrity (I)**: \nSimilar to confidentiality, while integrity might be affected indirectly by the potential for unauthorized modifications through XSS payloads, the direct impact seems more focused on confidentiality. Nevertheless, considering the possibility of tampering, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n**Availability (A)**: \nThere's no clear indication that the availability of the system would be directly impacted by this vulnerability.

It was found from vmcore that perf had registered two ops with the same content successively, both dynamic. After unregistering the second ops, a use-after-free occurred. In ftrace_shutdown(), when the second ops is unregistered, the FTRACE_UPDATE_CALLS command is not set because there is another enabled ops with the same content. Also, both ops are dynamic and the ftrace callback function is ftrace_ops_list_func, so the FTRACE_UPDATE_TRACE_FUNC command will not be set. Eventually the value of 'command' will be 0 and ftrace_shutdown() will skip the rcu synchronization. However, ftrace may be activated. When the ops is released, another CPU may be accessing the ops. Add the missing synchronization to fix this problem.

User interaction is required for triggering this vulnerability.\n", "response": "To determine the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we need to analyze the given CVE description and assign values to each base metric based on the provided information.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: Since the vulnerability requires a local attacker to exploit the issue, the attack vector is likely to be Local (L).\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: There's no indication that the exploitation process would require complex steps or conditions; hence, the attack complexity is considered Low (L).\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description states that an attacker can execute arbitrary code with privilege, indicating that the attacker needs high privileges to exploit the vulnerability. Therefore, Privileges Required is set to High (H).\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: According to the description, user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability. So, User Interaction is set to Required (R).\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: As the vulnerability affects a specific library (libsthmbc.so) and does not indicate any broader impact, the scope remains unchanged (U).\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Although the description mentions execution of arbitrary code, there's no explicit mention of data confidentiality being compromised. However, since the attacker has elevated privileges, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. Considering the severity, Confidentiality is set to High (H).\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: With the ability to execute arbitrary code, the integrity of the system could be compromised. Hence, Integrity is also set to High (H).\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: Given the potential for arbitrary code execution, the availability of the system might be affected.

Although gaining access to a mailbox could potentially reveal sensitive information, the primary concern is the unauthorized access itself rather than data exposure.\n\n- Integrity (I): L (Low)\nSimilar to confidentiality, integrity is also impacted at a lower level. While the vulnerability allows an attacker to gain access to a mailbox, it doesn't directly impact the integrity of the system or its data.\n\n- Availability (A): H (High)\nThe primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential denial-of-service (DoS) effect due to unauthorized access to mailboxes, making it difficult for legitimate users to manage their mailboxes securely.\n\nHere's the calculated CVSS v3.1 vector string:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "score": 2.3999999999999995, "success": true}

This indicates that an attacker can exploit the vulnerability from a network location without needing physical access or being adjacent to the system. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: \nSince the vulnerability requires no authentication and can be exploited remotely, it's likely that the attack complexity will be low because there are no additional requirements such as user interaction or complex setup needed for exploitation. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**: \nAs mentioned in the description, the vulnerability enables a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands. This means the attacker does not require any privileges to perform the attack since they can do so without logging in. Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n**User Interaction (UI)**: \nGiven that the vulnerability can be exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker, it implies that no user interaction is required for the attack to occur.

However, given the nature of the vulnerability, it's possible that sensitive data could be accessed or modified during exploitation. Since the primary concern here is the execution of arbitrary OS commands rather than data exposure, the chosen value is **High (H)** for integrity and availability concerns, but for confidentiality, it might seem more appropriate to choose 'none' if the focus was purely on command execution. However, considering potential data exposure through command execution, we'll use **High (H)**.\n\n**Integrity (I)**: \nSimilar to Confidentiality, the primary concern here is the ability to execute arbitrary OS commands, which could lead to modifications to the system.

Therefore, the attack complexity is considered Low (L).\n\n- Privileges Required (PR): N - To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker does not need any special privileges; they just need to send a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint. So, the required privilege level is None (N).\n\n- User Interaction (UI): R - The vulnerability requires the attacker to send a specially crafted request to the server, indicating that user interaction is necessary to trigger the vulnerability. Thus, the value is Required (R).\n\n- Scope (S): U - The scope of the vulnerability is limited to the affected application (flask-cors). It does not affect other parts of the system or network, so the scope remains unchanged (U).\n\n- Confidentiality (C): H - The vulnerability exposes sensitive data or functionality to unauthorized parties, posing a high risk to confidentiality.\n\n- Integrity (I): L - Although the vulnerability affects confidentiality, there's no indication that it directly impacts the integrity of the system or data. However, since it could allow malicious actors to perform unauthorized actions, it might indirectly impact integrity. But given the primary concern is confidentiality, we'll assign a lower impact on integrity.\n\n- Availability (A): L - There's no direct indication that the vulnerability would cause a denial-of-service condition or significantly impact availability. However, if exploited, it could lead to increased resource usage due to unauthorized access, but this is still considered low compared to confidentiality and integrity risks.\n\nHere's the calculated CVSS v3.1 vector string:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "score": 2.3, "success": true}

Therefore, the chosen value is AV:N.\n\n- Attack Complexity (AC):\n  There's no indication that the exploitation requires complex steps or specific conditions; thus, the complexity is considered low. So, the chosen value is AC:L.\n\n- Privileges Required (PR):\n  The vulnerability affects authenticated project owners, implying they already possess some level of privileges within the system. However, the nature of the exploit doesn't require high-level administrative privileges but rather manipulation of existing permissions. Thus, the chosen value is PR:L.\n\n- User Interaction (UI):\n  The vulnerability involves manipulating API requests, suggesting that user interaction might not be necessary for exploitation. However, since the description specifies \"authenticated project owners,\" there's an assumption that the attacker needs to interact with the system in some form (e.g., sending a crafted request). Given this context, the chosen value is UI:R.\n\n- Scope (S):\n  The description mentions bypassing group-level forking restrictions, indicating that the impact is confined to the affected projects and does not affect other parts of the system. Therefore, the scope remains unchanged, making the chosen value S:U.\n\n- Confidentiality (C):\n  Although the description doesn't explicitly mention confidentiality breaches, vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access or actions often imply potential exposure of sensitive data. In this case, the ability to bypass restrictions suggests a risk to integrity and availability more directly than confidentiality. However, considering the broader implications of such a vulnerability, a moderate risk to confidentiality cannot be ruled out entirely. Therefore, the chosen value is C:L.\n\n- Integrity (I):\n  Bypassing restrictions implies the potential for unauthorized modifications or actions, which directly impacts the integrity of the system. Therefore, the chosen value is I:H.\n\n- Availability (A):\n  The ability to bypass restrictions also poses a threat to the availability of resources, as it allows unauthorized access or actions that could disrupt normal operations. Therefore, the chosen value is A:H.\n\nNow, let's summarize these values into the CVSS v3.1 vector string:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "score": 3.3, "success": true}

This can cause a deadlock in the scenario reported by syz-bot below: CPU0 CPU1 CPU2 ---- ---- ---- lock(console_owner); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(&port_lock_key); lock(&port->lock); lock(console_owner); As commit dbdda842fe96 (\"printk: Add console owner and waiter logic to load balance console writes\") said, such deadlock can be prevented by using printk_deferred() in kmalloc() (which is invoked in the section guarded by the port->lock). But there are too many printk() on the kmalloc() path, and kmalloc() can be called from anywhere, so changing printk() to printk_deferred() is too complicated and inelegant. Therefore, this patch chooses to specify __GFP_NOWARN to kmalloc(), so that printk() will not be called, and this deadlock problem can be avoided.

There is no indication that an attacker would need network access to exploit this vulnerability. However, since the Linux kernel is typically accessed through network interfaces, I'm assuming a network attack vector is plausible.\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: L (Low)\nJustification: The vulnerability requires a specific sequence of events and lock acquisitions to occur, making it relatively complex to exploit. However, given the nature of the bug, an attacker might still find it feasible to trigger the deadlock condition.\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**: H (High)\nJustification: To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would likely require high privileges, as they would need to manipulate system calls or kernel functions to create the deadlock situation.\n\n**User Interaction (UI)**: R (Required)\nJustification: The vulnerability requires user interaction, as the deadlock occurs when a user triggers a specific sequence of actions, such as writing to a pseudo-terminal (pty).\n\n**Scope (S)**: U (Unchanged)\nJustification: The scope of the vulnerability appears to be limited to the local system, as it involves internal kernel mechanisms and does not seem to affect external systems or networks.\n\n**Confidentiality (C)**: N (None)\nJustification: The vulnerability primarily affects availability rather than confidentiality. While it's possible that an attacker could use this vulnerability to disrupt system functionality, there is no clear indication that sensitive data would be compromised.\n\n**Integrity (I)**: N (None)\nJustification: Similar to confidentiality, the primary impact of this vulnerability is on availability rather than integrity. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability might cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, but there is no indication that data would be modified or corrupted.\n\n**Availability (A)**: H (High)\nJustification: The vulnerability can lead to a deadlock, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, where the system becomes unavailable or unresponsive.\n\nHere's the calculated CVSS v3.1 vector string:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.0, "success": true}

Such deadlock can happen in the following situation. When all journal buckets are fully filled by active jset with heavy write I/O load, the cache set registration (after a reboot) will load all active jsets and inserting them into the btree again (which is called journal replay). If a journaled bkey is inserted into a btree node and results btree node split, new journal request might be triggered. For example, the btree grows one more level after the node split, then the root node record in cache device super block will be upgrade by bch_journal_meta() from bch_btree_set_root(). But there is no space in journal buckets, the journal replay has to wait for new journal bucket to be reclaimed after at least one journal bucket replayed. This is one example that how the journal no-space deadlock happens. The solution to avoid the deadlock is to reserve 1 journal bucket in run time, and only permit the reserved journal bucket to be used during cache set registration procedure for things like journal replay. Then the journal space will never be fully filled, there is no chance for journal no-space deadlock to happen anymore. This patch adds a new member \"bool do_reserve\" in struct journal, it is inititalized to 0 (false) when struct journal is allocated, and set to 1 (true) by bch_journal_space_reserve() when all initialization done in run_cache_set(). In the run time when journal_reclaim() tries to allocate a new journal bucket, free_journal_buckets() is called to check whether there are enough free journal buckets to use. If there is only 1 free journal bucket and journal->do_reserve is 1 (true), the last bucket is reserved and free_journal_buckets() will return 0 to indicate no free journal bucket. Then journal_reclaim() will give up, and try next time to see whetheer there is free journal bucket to allocate. By this method, there is always 1 jouranl bucket reserved in run time. During the cache set registration, journal->do_reserve is 0 (false), so the reserved journal bucket can be used to avoid the no-space deadlock.\n", "response": "Based on the provided CVE description, here's my analysis of the base metrics:\n\n- Attack Vector (AV): N - The vulnerability is related to the Linux kernel, which implies that an attacker would need network access to exploit this vulnerability remotely.\n- Attack Complexity (AC): L - The attack complexity is low because the vulnerability is related to a specific scenario where the system is under heavy write I/O load, making it relatively easy to trigger the issue.\n- Privileges Required (PR): N - An unprivileged user can potentially trigger the journal no-space deadlock, as it doesn't require any special privileges.\n- User Interaction (UI): N - No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability; it can occur automatically due to the described scenario.\n- Scope (S): U - The scope remains unchanged since the vulnerability affects the local system and does not spread to other systems.\n- Confidentiality (C): N - The vulnerability primarily affects availability rather than confidentiality, as it causes a deadlock but doesn't directly compromise sensitive data.\n- Integrity (I): N - Similar to confidentiality, the primary impact is on availability rather than integrity, as the deadlock prevents normal operation but doesn't modify data.\n- Availability (A): H - The journal no-space deadlock significantly impacts the system's availability, causing it to become unresponsive or hang indefinitely.\n\nHere's the calculated CVSS v3.1 vector string:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

Therefore, the chosen value is AV:N (Network).\n\n- Attack Complexity (AC):\n  There is no indication that the attack requires complex steps or specific conditions to execute; thus, the complexity is considered low. So, the chosen value is AC:L (Low).\n\n- Privileges Required (PR):\n  This vulnerability does not require any special privileges to exploit since it involves a race condition in a system call accessible by normal users. Hence, the chosen value is PR:N (None).\n\n- User Interaction (UI):\n  As there is no mention of user interaction required to trigger the vulnerability, the chosen value is UI:N (None).\n\n- Scope (S):\n  The scope remains unchanged because the vulnerability is within the Linux kernel itself and doesn't affect other components outside of it. Therefore, the chosen value is S:U (Unchanged).\n\n- Confidentiality (C):\n  Although the description mentions a data-race issue, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data, the primary concern here seems to be integrity rather than confidentiality. However, considering the nature of the bug, it might allow an attacker to read or modify data, so we'll assign a moderate risk level. Therefore, the chosen value is C:L (Low).\n\n- Integrity (I):\n  Given the potential for data corruption due to concurrent modifications, the chosen value is I:L (Low).\n\n- Availability (A):\n  There's no clear indication that the vulnerability directly impacts availability, such as causing a denial-of-service scenario.

It requires direct access to the system, making it a local attack vector.\n  \n- Attack Complexity (AC): H (High) - To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have physical access to the device and manipulate the USB connection, which involves complex steps such as removing the BT USB dongle at the right moment. This complexity makes it difficult for attackers to successfully exploit the vulnerability.\n\n- Privileges Required (PR): N (None) - Since this is a kernel-level issue, no specific privileges are required to exploit it. An unprivileged user can potentially trigger the bug by manipulating the USB connection.\n\n- User Interaction (UI): R (Required) - The vulnerability is triggered by a specific action (removing the BT USB dongle without properly releasing the interface). Therefore, user interaction is necessary to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- Scope (S): U (Unchanged) - The scope remains unchanged because the vulnerability affects the local system and does not spread to other systems or networks.\n\n- Confidentiality (C): N (None) - Although the vulnerability causes a kernel panic, there is no indication that sensitive information is being leaked or compromised. Thus, confidentiality is not affected.\n\n- Integrity (I): H (High) - The kernel panic caused by this vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service condition, affecting the integrity of the system. If the system crashes, its integrity is compromised.\n\n- Availability (A): H (High) - Similar to integrity, the kernel panic resulting from this vulnerability impacts the availability of the system, causing it to become unavailable until it is restarted.\n\nHere's the calculated CVSS v3.1 vector string:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 0.7999999999999998, "success": true}

A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request).\n", "response": "Based on the provided CVE description, here's my analysis of the base metrics:\n\n- Attack Vector (AV): N - This vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a network attack.\n- Attack Complexity (AC): L - An attacker needs to have control over content on the target site or its subdomains, which requires some level of complexity but is still feasible.\n- Privileges Required (PR): H - To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to have control over content on the target site or its subdomains, implying high privileges.\n- User Interaction (UI): R - The attacker needs to manipulate content on the target site or its subdomains, which typically involves user interaction (e.g., via XSS).\n- Scope (S): U - The scope remains unchanged since the vulnerability does not allow an attacker to access more resources than what they already have access to.\n- Confidentiality (C): L - Although the vulnerability doesn't directly compromise confidentiality, it allows an attacker to make unauthorized requests on behalf of a legitimate user, potentially leading to data exposure or manipulation.\n- Integrity (I): H - The integrity of the system is compromised because an attacker can manipulate cookies and issue requests on behalf of a legitimate user.\n- Availability (A): N - There is no indication that the vulnerability affects the availability of the system.\n\nHere's the calculated CVSS v3.1 score:\n\nBase Metrics:\n- AV: N\n- AC: L\n- PR: H\n- UI: R\n- S: U\n- C: L\n- I: H\n- A: N\n\nCVSS v3.1 Vector String:\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 0.8999999999999995, "success": true}

Therefore, the attack vector is likely to be **Network (N)**.\n\n**Attack Complexity (AC)**: \nCross-site scripting vulnerabilities often require user interaction to execute, but since they can be triggered by simply visiting a maliciously crafted URL, the complexity is considered low. Thus, the attack complexity is **Low (L)**.\n\n**Privileges Required (PR)**: \nNo special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability; an attacker can trigger it using normal user access. So, the privileges required are **None (N)**.\n\n**User Interaction (UI)**: \nAs mentioned earlier, cross-site scripting requires user interaction to execute, so the user interaction is **Required (R)**.\n\n**Scope (S)**: \nSince the vulnerability affects all versions of GitLab CE/EE within specific version ranges, it's reasonable to assume that the scope remains unchanged. Therefore, the scope is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n**Confidentiality (C)**: \nCross-site scripting primarily affects availability rather than confidentiality. However, if sensitive data is being processed on the affected system, there could be some risk to confidentiality. Given the nature of the vulnerability, let's assign a moderate risk level, which aligns with **High (H)**.\n\n**Integrity (I)**: \nSimilar to confidentiality, integrity might not be directly impacted by cross-site scripting. However, if the vulnerable application processes sensitive data, there could be some risk to integrity. Again, given the nature of the vulnerability, let's assign a moderate risk level, which aligns with **High (H)**.\n\n**Availability (A)**: \nCross-site scripting can significantly impact availability because it allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that can cause denial-of-service attacks or other disruptions.

Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: There is no indication that the exploitation requires complex steps or specific conditions; thus, the attack complexity is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: To exploit this XSS vulnerability, an attacker does not necessarily require elevated privileges. They might be able to execute the attack using normal user permissions. So, the required privilege level is **None (N)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: This vulnerability involves displaying error messages that could lead to XSS attacks, which typically require user interaction to execute. Hence, the user interaction requirement is **Required (R)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: As the vulnerability affects certain error messages within the application, it's reasonable to assume that the scope remains unchanged, i.e., **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: XSS vulnerabilities primarily target confidentiality by allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the website, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure. Thus, the impact on confidentiality is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: While XSS attacks often focus on confidentiality, they may also have integrity implications if the injected scripts modify data. However, since the primary concern here seems to be confidentiality, we'll consider the integrity impact as **Low (L)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: XSS attacks do not directly affect availability but can indirectly cause issues if the injected scripts consume excessive resources.

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `informacao_adicional.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `descricao` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `informacao_adicional.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed, the malicious payload is executed in the victim's browser, potentially compromising the user's data and system. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.6 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "response": "Based on the provided CVE description, here's my analysis of the base metrics:\n\n- Attack Vector (AV): N - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network, as the attacker can send malicious input to the `informacao_adicional.php` endpoint from anywhere.\n- Attack Complexity (AC): L - The attack complexity is low because the vulnerability can be exploited using standard web attacks, such as sending crafted HTTP requests, without requiring any special privileges or conditions.\n- Privileges Required (PR): N - An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to the `informacao_adicional.php` endpoint.\n- User Interaction (UI): R - The vulnerability requires user interaction because the malicious script is executed when the affected page is accessed by a user who has already visited the page containing the malicious payload.\n- Scope (S): U - The scope remains unchanged because the vulnerability does not allow the attacker to access or modify other resources beyond the targeted endpoint.\n- Confidentiality (C): H - The confidentiality impact is high because the vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that can steal sensitive information from the user's browser.\n- Integrity (I): H - The integrity impact is also high because the injected scripts can modify the user's session data and potentially compromise their system.\n- Availability (A): H - The availability impact is high because the vulnerability can cause the application to become unavailable due to resource exhaustion or crashes caused by the malicious scripts.\n\nHere's the complete CVSS v3.1 vector string:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 3.4000000000000004, "success": true}

This lingering reference comes from a secpath (which holds a ref on the xfrm_state), which is still attached to an skb. This skb is not leaked, it ends up on sk_receive_queue and then gets defer-free'd by skb_attempt_defer_free. The problem happens when we defer freeing an skb (push it on one CPU's defer_list), and don't flush that list before the netns is deleted. In that case, we still have a reference on the xfrm_state that we don't expect at this point. We already drop the skb's dst in the TCP receive path when it's no longer needed, so let's also drop the secpath. At this point, tcp_filter has already called into the LSM hooks that may require the secpath, so it should not be needed anymore.

In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it is possible for any authenticated user, through the use of the filemanager to delete any file owned by the user running the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) on the host without any limitation on the filesystem's scope. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to arbitrarily remove content from the Wiki resulting in partial loss of data and defacement/deterioration of the website. In the context of a container installation of YesWiki without any modification, the `yeswiki` files (for example .php) are not owned by the same user (root) as the one running the FPM process (www-data). However in a standard installation, www-data may also be the owner of the PHP files, allowing a malicious user to completely cut the access to the wiki by deleting all important PHP files (like index.php or core files of YesWiki). Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for this issue.\n", "response": "Based on the provided CVE description, here's my analysis of the base metrics:\n\n- Attack Vector (AV): L (Local)\nThe vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated user within the local network or system, but it requires direct access to the system where the vulnerable application is installed. Therefore, the attack vector is Local (L).\n\n- Attack Complexity (AC): L (Low)\nThe exploit does not require any special conditions or complex steps; an authenticated user can simply utilize the file manager to delete files. Thus, the attack complexity is considered low.\n\n- Privileges Required (PR): N (None)\nAs mentioned in the description, any authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability, regardless of their privileges. They do not need elevated permissions to perform the attack.\n\n- User Interaction (UI): R (Required)\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to interact with the file manager, which implies that user interaction is required.\n\n- Scope (S): U (Unchanged)\nThis vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system. Since the impact is not limited to just one component or service, the scope remains unchanged.\n\n- Confidentiality (C): H (High)\nThe vulnerability allows an attacker to delete arbitrary files, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information. Therefore, the confidentiality impact is high.\n\n- Integrity (I): H (High)\nDeleting files can compromise the integrity of the system, making it difficult to maintain its functionality. Hence, the integrity impact is also high.\n\n- Availability (A): H (High)\nBy deleting critical files like index.php or core files, an attacker can render the wiki unavailable, affecting its availability.
