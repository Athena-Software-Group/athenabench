They also added a rule to delete messages from the security operations address, concealing alerts and replies to the attacker’s internal spearphishing emails.\n", "response": "Based on the given scenario, the attacker is using email rules to evade detection by moving suspicious emails to a hidden folder and deleting security-related communications. This behavior can be addressed by implementing the following mitigation:\n\nM1055, M1020\n\nExplanation:\n- M1055: Implement automated indicators of compromise (IoC) feeding into a security information and event management (SIEM) system to detect and alert on unusual email activity.\n- M1020: Use email content filtering to block or quarantine emails based on keywords, such as \"malware\" or \"phish,\" to prevent the creation of malicious email rules.\n\nThese two mitigations will help identify and prevent the creation of malicious email rules, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the attacker's evasion tactics.", "prediction": "X", "answer": "M1047", "score": 0.0, "success": true}

They set the service to run under the LocalSystem account, ensuring the malicious payload executed with SYSTEM privileges on every restart.\n", "response": "Based on the given scenario, the attacker has achieved persistence by installing a new service that runs with elevated privileges. To mitigate this, we can implement the following measures:\n\nTo prevent unauthorized services from running at startup, we can use:\n\n- M1020: Restrict Registry Run Keys Writing - This prevents attackers from modifying registry keys used for autostarting applications.\n- M1022: Restrict System Service Accounts - Limiting the ability to create or modify system services will make it harder for an attacker to achieve persistence.\n- M1035: Use Secure Boot - Ensuring the system boots securely will prevent malware from loading during the boot process.\n- M1036: Implement User Account Control (UAC) - UAC helps prevent elevation of privilege attacks by prompting users before making changes to the system.\n- M1037: Use Application Whitelisting - By whitelisting approved applications, we can prevent unknown executables from running.\n- M1041: Restrict Access to Sensitive Areas of the Registry - Limiting access to sensitive areas of the registry will make it more difficult for an attacker to install a malicious service.\n- M1048: Restrict System Binary Execution - Preventing execution of binaries outside of trusted paths will limit the impact of a potential exploit.\n- M1051: Restrict Registry Write to System Components - This will prevent attackers from writing to critical system components like the registry.\n- M1059: Use a Hardware-Enabled Security Module - Using a hardware-enabled security module such as Secure Boot or Trusted Platform Module (TPM) will provide additional protection against firmware-level attacks.\n\nAnswer: M1020, M1022, M1035, M1036, M1037, M1041, M1048, M1051, M1059", "prediction": "M1020, M1022, M1035, M1036, M1037, M1041, M1048, M1051, M1059", "answer": "M1018, M1022, M1026, M1028, M1033, M1040, M1045, M1047, M1054", "score": 0.1111111111111111, "success": true}
