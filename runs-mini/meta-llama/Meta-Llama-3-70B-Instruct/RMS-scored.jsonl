Finally, to prevent similar attacks in the future, I recommend conducting regular software inventory and vulnerability management (M1053) and implementing a software restriction policy (M1028).\n\nAnswer: M1022, M1026, M1037, M1041, M1018, M1050, M1053, M1028, M1044", "prediction": "M1022, M1026, M1037, M1041, M1018, M1050, M1053, M1028, M1044", "answer": "M1018, M1022, M1026, M1028, M1033, M1040, M1045, M1047, M1054", "score": 0.4444444444444444, "success": true}
