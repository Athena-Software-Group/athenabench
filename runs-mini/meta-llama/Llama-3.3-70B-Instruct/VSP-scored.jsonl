This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious request to the WordPress site, which implies the attack can be launched over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not mention any specific conditions that would make the attack complex, such as needing to bypass additional security mechanisms or requiring specialized conditions. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability requires the attacker to have at least Contributor-level access, which means they need some level of privilege but not the highest. However, since it doesn't specify that high privileges like admin rights are needed, and considering the scale provided, **Low (L)** seems more appropriate than None or High.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability involves injecting scripts into pages that will execute when a user accesses those pages, implying that user interaction (visiting the infected page) is required for the exploit to have its effect. Therefore, the chosen value is **Required (R)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: There's no indication that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (the WordPress plugin).

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not indicate any specific complexity requirements for exploiting the vulnerability. Since XSS vulnerabilities often require little to no special conditions to be exploited beyond crafting a malicious input, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability allows for Stored XSS, which typically means an attacker can inject malicious scripts into a website that will execute when other users visit the site. There's no indication that high privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability; thus, the chosen value is **None (N)**, assuming anyone can interact with the affected component.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: For Stored XSS, user interaction is required for the payload to be executed (i.e., a user needs to visit the compromised page). However, considering the nature of Stored XSS where the malicious script is stored on the server and executed automatically when a user visits the page, some might argue it's **None (N)** because once the payload is injected, no further interaction from the attacker is needed for it to affect users. But since user interaction (visiting the page) is necessary for the impact to occur, the more fitting choice here, aligning with typical CVSS scoring for Stored XSS, would actually be **None (N)** because the interaction is from the victim, not the attacker, after the initial injection.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description doesn't explicitly mention the vulnerability allowing the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. Thus, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**, indicating the vulnerability does not allow the attacker to affect components beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component itself.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: XSS vulnerabilities can lead to the theft of sensitive information such as session cookies, allowing attackers to hijack user sessions. Therefore, the impact on confidentiality is significant, and the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, XSS attacks can modify data on the website or trick users into performing unintended actions, leading to a loss of integrity. Hence, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While XSS primarily impacts confidentiality and integrity, it's less commonly associated directly with availability issues unless the attack specifically aims at causing a denial-of-service condition. However, given the potential for significant disruption through manipulated content or actions, one could consider **Low (L)** or **High (H)** depending on the context. For most XSS cases, especially Stored XSS, the primary concerns are around data theft and manipulation rather than service availability. Yet, considering the broad potential impacts, including the possibility of using XSS as part of a broader campaign to disrupt services, the conservative approach here leans towards recognizing potential availability impacts, but traditionally, XSS is not primarily about denying service, so **None (N)** might also be argued.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of exploiting this XSS vulnerability is considered low because it typically involves crafting a malicious URL or payload that the victim must interact with, but does not require specialized conditions or systems to be in place beyond what is normally available. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since this is a reflected XSS attack, it does not require any privileges on the system to exploit. The attacker relies on the user's session and permissions within the application.

For most XSS vulnerabilities, especially reflected ones, the impact is generally contained within the same security scope as the vulnerable application. Thus, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: XSS attacks can often lead to the theft of sensitive information such as session cookies, allowing an attacker to impersonate the victim.

Given that this can be exploited over a network (for instance, if the system is configured to handle cryptographic operations remotely or if an attacker can send crafted packets to exploit the vulnerability), the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions a specific condition (integer underflow due to a larger source buffer than the key size) that needs to be met to exploit the vulnerability. However, it does not imply that the attack requires special conditions or configurations beyond exploiting the mentioned vulnerability itself. Therefore, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability is in the kernel and involves handling of cryptographic requests, which typically do not require user-level privileges to initiate (especially considering network-initiated attacks), the privileges required are considered **None (N)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is necessary for the exploitation of this vulnerability. Thus, **None (N)** is the correct choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data being processed by the crypto module within the kernel.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated from anywhere over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping,\" which suggests that exploiting this vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or systems configurations beyond what is normally present in a default installation of the affected software.

However, the initial exploitation by the attacker does not require interaction from another user; the attacker themselves performs the action necessary to inject the script. After injection, the script executes without needing further user interaction beyond accessing the compromised page. Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**, because no interaction from a second user is needed for the exploit itself, even though users' actions (visiting the page) trigger the malicious script execution.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability allows for the execution of scripts within the context of the vulnerable application (the WordPress site) and there's no indication that it can affect resources beyond the security scope of that application, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Given that stored cross-site scripting (XSS) can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information (like session cookies), the impact on confidentiality is significant.

Hence, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While XSS primarily affects confidentiality and integrity, it might also indirectly affect availability if the injected scripts cause denial-of-service conditions or significantly degrade the performance of the targeted system. However, direct impacts on availability are less typical for XSS compared to confidentiality and integrity. Considering the primary effects described, the chosen value could lean towards **None (N)** or **Low (L)**, depending on interpretation. Given the potential for significant disruption through malicious scripts, **High (H)** might seem excessive unless specific scenarios of denial-of-service are envisioned, which are not detailed here. Yet, considering the broad potential impacts, especially in a scenario where scripts could be designed to overwhelm the system, a case could be made for **High (H)**, acknowledging that typical XSS discussions focus more on C and I impacts.\n\nGiven these considerations and focusing strictly on the provided details without assuming additional potential impacts not explicitly mentioned, a conservative alignment with common CVSS scoring practices for XSS vulnerabilities, particularly emphasizing their primary confidentiality and integrity impacts, would suggest:\n\n- **C:** High (H)\n- **I:** High (H)\n- **A:** High (H), considering the potential for disruptive scripts, even though traditional XSS focuses on C and I.\n\nThus, summarizing all metrics:\n- **AV:** N\n- **AC:** L\n- **PR:** L\n- **UI:** N\n- **S:** U\n- **C:** H\n- **I:** H\n- **A:** H\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 3.4000000000000004, "success": true}

Prior to version 25.4.0, the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently, conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization, which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result, the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions, conda-build creates a potential execution pathway for malicious code, violating security assumptions. This issue has been patched in version 25.4.0.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specially crafted meta.yaml file that contains malicious selector expressions. Since this can be done over a network (e.g., by uploading a malicious package or meta.yaml file to a repository), the attack vector is Network. Therefore, **AV: N**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of the attack is Low because it involves simply crafting a malicious meta.yaml file with specific selector expressions that the eval function will execute. No special conditions or complex setups are required beyond understanding how to exploit the eval function's behavior. Thus, **AC: L**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The privileges required for the attack are None because the vulnerability can be exploited without needing any special permissions within the system where conda-build is running. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious package, assuming they have the ability to upload or submit packages to the build environment. Hence, **PR: N**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: User interaction is not required for the exploitation of this vulnerability since the malicious action is triggered automatically when the conda-build tool processes the meta.yaml file containing the malicious selector expressions. Therefore, **UI: N**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The scope of the vulnerability is Unchanged because the vulnerability does not allow the attacker to impact resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component (in this case, conda-build). Although significant damage can be done within the build environment, there's no indication that this vulnerability would inherently allow an attacker to escalate their privileges to affect other components or systems outside the immediate scope of the conda-build process. So, **S: U**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The impact on confidentiality is High because an attacker could potentially read sensitive information from the build environment through carefully crafted selector expressions. Given the nature of the vulnerability allowing arbitrary code execution, it's reasonable to assume that confidentiality could be compromised. Thus, **C: H**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The impact on integrity is also High. The ability to execute arbitrary code means an attacker could modify files, install malware, or perform other actions that compromise the integrity of the system or data within the build environment. Therefore, **I: H**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The impact on availability is High because an attacker could use the arbitrary code execution capability to disrupt the build process, delete essential files, or otherwise cause the build environment to become unavailable.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE, let's analyze each metric based on the provided description:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: Given that the vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers through the 'purechatWidgetName' parameter, which implies interaction over the network (e.g., via HTTP requests), the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**. Justification: The attack can originate from any location on the network, not requiring physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Since the vulnerability arises from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, which is a common web application vulnerability, exploiting this does not require specialized conditions or systems configurations beyond what is typically found. Thus, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**. Justification: No specific, unusual conditions need to be met to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description mentions that unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability, meaning no privileges are required to perform the attack. Therefore, **None (N)** is the correct choice. Justification: The attacker does not need any form of authentication or privilege to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: Although users must access an injected page for the script to execute, the initial exploitation by the attacker does not require any interaction from a user. However, since the impact (execution of arbitrary scripts) depends on a user accessing the page, one might argue for **Required (R)**. But considering the question asks about the initial exploitation phase, the correct interpretation in the context of CVSS scoring for the initial attack vector is **None (N)** because the vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction at the point of injection. Justification: The attacker can inject the malicious script without needing a user to interact with anything at the time of the exploit.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data on the system where the plugin is installed. However, the description specifically talks about injecting scripts, which primarily impacts the same security scope (the WordPress site itself). Hence, **Unchanged (U)** is the most fitting choice. Justification: The vulnerability does not allow the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (the WordPress plugin).\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Given that arbitrary scripts can be executed, sensitive information could potentially be accessed or stolen, indicating a significant impact on confidentiality. Therefore, **High (H)** is chosen. Justification: Execution of arbitrary scripts can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, with the ability to execute arbitrary scripts, an attacker could modify data, leading to a high impact on integrity. So, **High (H)** is selected. Justification: Arbitrary script execution allows for modification of data, affecting its integrity.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impact described involves script execution rather than denial-of-service, the potential for arbitrary script execution could also include actions that affect availability (e.g., crashing the service or causing it to become unresponsive). Considering the broad capabilities an attacker gains, **High (H)** is a reasonable choice. Justification: Potential for significant disruption or degradation of service due to arbitrary script execution.\n\nGiven these choices, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the selected metrics.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 3.700000000000001, "success": true}

This vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly validate certificates for hosted metrics services. An on-path attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting network traffic using a crafted certificate. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to masquerade as a trusted host and monitor or change communications between the remote metrics service and the vulnerable client.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we analyze each metric as follows:\n\n- Attack Vector (AV): The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who is able to intercept network traffic, which implies the attack can be launched over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is Network (N).\n- Attack Complexity (AC): The description suggests that exploiting the vulnerability requires crafting a certificate and being in a position to intercept network traffic, but it doesn't imply a need for specialized conditions or multiple exploits. Thus, the complexity is considered Low (L).\n- Privileges Required (PR): The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker, meaning no privileges are required on the system to launch the attack. Therefore, the chosen value is None (N).\n- User Interaction (UI): There's no indication that user interaction is necessary for the exploitation of the vulnerability. Hence, the chosen value is None (N).\n- Scope (S): The description does not indicate that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. Therefore, the chosen value is Unchanged (U).\n- Confidentiality (C): A successful exploit could allow the attacker to monitor communications, potentially accessing sensitive information. This suggests a significant impact on confidentiality, so the chosen value is High (H).\n- Integrity (I): The attacker could also change communications, indicating they can modify data, which affects integrity. Thus, the chosen value is High (H).\n- Availability (A): While the primary impacts mentioned are on confidentiality and integrity, there's no explicit mention of the attacker being able to disrupt service availability directly through this exploit. However, given the potential for manipulation of communications, one might argue for some level of impact on availability. Yet, based strictly on the description provided, the most direct interpretation relates to confidentiality and integrity. Still, considering the potential for service disruption through manipulated communications, a case could be made for Low (L) impact on availability, but since the focus is more on data aspects, the conservative approach aligns with None (N) or Low (L). Given the context, Low (L) seems more appropriate due to the potential for disrupting the service by manipulating the communications, even though it's not explicitly stated.\n\nTherefore, the CVSS v3.1 vector string, considering the above justifications and choosing Low (L) for Availability due to the potential indirect impact on service through data manipulation, is constructed as follows:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 4.6000000000000005, "success": true}

Then we pass the result to uverbs_request_next_ptr() which also could potentially wrap. The \"cmd.sge_count * sizeof(struct ib_uverbs_sge)\" multiplication can also overflow on 32bit systems although it's fine on 64bit systems. This patch does two things. First, I've re-arranged the condition in uverbs_request_next_ptr() so that the use controlled variable \"len\" is on one side of the comparison by itself without any math. Then I've modified all the callers to use size_mul() for the multiplications.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, let's analyze each metric step by step:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability is related to the Linux kernel and involves user-controlled input that can cause an integer overflow. Given that this can be exploited over the network through RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) protocols, the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**, as it reflects the potential for remote exploitation without requiring local access or physical proximity.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The attack complexity is considered **Low (L)** because the exploitability of the integer overflow does not require specialized conditions or sophisticated techniques beyond providing crafted input that triggers the overflow.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability can be triggered by user-controlled input without specifying the need for elevated privileges, the **None (N)** option is chosen, indicating that no special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability does not require any interaction from another user besides the attacker; thus, **None (N)** is selected, as the exploit can be automated without needing additional user actions.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Given that the vulnerability affects the Linux kernel and there's no indication that it would impact resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component, **Unchanged (U)** is the correct choice, suggesting that the vulnerability does not allow the attacker to impact components beyond the immediate vulnerable resource.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Although the primary impact described is related to potential code execution or system compromise due to integer overflow, which might imply confidentiality impacts, the direct effect mentioned (integer overflow leading to potential wrapping and incorrect memory access) suggests significant potential for data exposure or manipulation. Therefore, considering the potential worst-case scenario where an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to expose sensitive information, **High (H)** is chosen.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to Confidentiality, the ability to manipulate memory or execute arbitrary code due to the integer overflow implies a high risk to system integrity, as an attacker could modify critical system data. Hence, **High (H)** is selected.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The potential for denial-of-service or system crash due to the integer overflow, especially if the attacker can reliably trigger the condition, suggests a significant impact on availability.

This issue can be exploited by an attacker who can execute code on the system, but it does not explicitly require network access. However, considering the nature of the vulnerability and the fact that it's a kernel issue which might be reachable through various vectors including network if there are other vulnerabilities allowing code execution, the most fitting choice seems to be **Network (N)**, assuming the potential for exploitation paths that could involve network-accessible components or services, even though the direct exploit might not be over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability arises from a specific sequence of operations within the kernel's power management and device driver setup. Exploiting this would likely require understanding of the kernel internals and potentially crafting specific conditions under which `rk_hdptx_phy_runtime_resume()` is called before `platform_set_drvdata()`. Given these specifics, the complexity could be considered **Low (L)** because once the vulnerability is understood, exploiting it might not require significant additional complexity beyond reaching the point where the vulnerable code path can be triggered.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since this vulnerability is in the kernel, exploiting it would typically require **None (N)** privileges in the sense that the vulnerability itself doesn't specify a need for elevated user privileges to trigger the condition. However, reaching the code path might require some level of access or specific conditions, but based strictly on the description, it suggests a lack of privilege requirement directly for the exploit.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description implies that the vulnerability can be triggered without requiring any interaction from a user, making **None (N)** the appropriate choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the kernel, and its exploitation does not imply an impact outside of the scope of the vulnerable component itself.

However, based on the description provided, the direct impact isn't clearly tied to confidentiality, so a conservative approach might lean towards **High (H)** considering the potential for information disclosure in the context of a kernel vulnerability, although this is somewhat speculative without explicit details on information disclosure.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to confidentiality, the direct impact of a NULL pointer dereference could potentially allow for modification of data, especially in a kernel context where such a flaw could be leveraged for arbitrary code execution, thus affecting **Integrity**. Hence, **High (H)** seems a reasonable choice given the potential implications of such a vulnerability in kernel code.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: A NULL pointer dereference can lead to a crash or freeze of the system, directly impacting **Availability**.

Given the choices and focusing strictly on the information provided, which emphasizes data and integrity impacts more than service disruption, a conservative approach might select **Low (L)** or acknowledge potential for **High (H)** if considering broader implications of script injection on system stability.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated remotely over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not specify complex conditions or requirements for the exploit beyond tricking users, suggesting that the complexity of the attack is relatively low. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: There's no indication that the attacker needs any specific privileges to initiate the attack; they rely on tricking users. Hence, the chosen value is **None (N)**, indicating no privileges are required.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The attack involves tricking users into authorizing actions, which means user interaction is necessary for the attack to succeed. Therefore, the chosen value is **Required (R)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the authorization of actions on the user's behalf within the same security scope (the user's account or session), there's no change in scope. So, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: If an attacker can authorize sensitive actions, this implies potential access to confidential information. Given the sensitivity of the actions, the impact on confidentiality could be significant. Thus, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, if an attacker can authorize actions on a user's behalf, this could lead to modifications of data or settings, impacting integrity. The potential for damage suggests a high impact. Therefore, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary concern seems to be about authorization and potential data access/modification, there's less direct implication on availability (e.g., denying service). However, considering the broad potential impacts of unauthorized actions, one might argue for some level of availability impact. Yet, based strictly on the description provided, the focus is more on confidentiality and integrity rather than causing a denial of service. Still, given the severity of potential actions, a case could be made for **High (H)**, but traditionally, availability impacts are more about service disruption rather than data manipulation. Thus, a conservative interpretation might lean towards **None (N)** or **Low (L)**, but considering the potential severe outcomes, **High (H)** aligns more closely with the potential overall impact when considering the combination of confidentiality, integrity, and the fact that significant unauthorized actions could indirectly affect system availability by overwhelming it with malicious requests or changes.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen values for each metric.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "score": 2.3000000000000007, "success": true}

By default, the GID is the user's phone number unless they specifically opt out. A phone number is very sensitive information because it can be tied back to individuals. The app does not encrypt the GID in messages.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability involves sending unencrypted sensitive information (the GID, which can be a phone number) over messages. Since this can be done remotely through the network, the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**. Justification: The attack can be initiated from any location where the attacker has network access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of exploiting this vulnerability seems straightforward since it involves simply intercepting or accessing the messages that contain the unencrypted GID. Therefore, the best choice is **Low (L)**. Justification: No special conditions or sophisticated techniques beyond basic network access and message interception are required.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker doesn't need any specific privileges on the target system or device. Thus, **None (N)** is the correct choice. Justification: The vulnerability can be exploited without needing any form of authentication or elevated privileges.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The exploitation of this vulnerability does not require any interaction from the user of the targeted device or system. Hence, **None (N)** is appropriate. Justification: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability independently without needing the user to perform any actions.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: This vulnerability affects the confidentiality of data related to the device or user but does not imply an impact on other resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component itself. So, **Unchanged (U)** is the suitable option. Justification: There's no indication that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the immediate scope of the vulnerable application or device.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Given that sensitive information (phone numbers) can be obtained by exploiting this vulnerability, the impact on confidentiality is significant. Therefore, **High (H)** is chosen. Justification: Phone numbers are considered personally identifiable information (PII) and can be used for identity theft, harassment, or other malicious purposes.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The vulnerability primarily affects the confidentiality of the data rather than its integrity. However, considering the potential misuse of the exposed information, one might argue for some level of impact. But strictly based on the description provided, the primary concern is confidentiality, not integrity. Thus, **None (N)** could be argued, but given the context, **Low (L)** might also be considered if one interprets the exposure of sensitive data as potentially leading to further integrity issues indirectly. For strict adherence to the provided details, **None (N)** seems more fitting. Justification: The direct impact described is on confidentiality, not on altering data.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: There's no mention of how this vulnerability could affect the availability of the service or system.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated from any location where the network is accessible.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description indicates that the web API allows execution of arbitrary SQL queries without any access control, suggesting that no special conditions or configurations are required to exploit this vulnerability. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**, because the attack does not require sophisticated conditions beyond accessing the vulnerable API.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability allows for arbitrary SQL query execution and potentially leads to Remote Code Execution without mentioning any need for specific privileges, the chosen value is **None (N)**.

This can be exploited over the network since ksmbd is related to SMB (Server Message Block) services which are typically accessed over a network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The exploitability of this vulnerability seems to rely on specific conditions such as a race condition and type confusion, which might require some level of complexity to achieve. However, given that the vulnerability exists due to a missing check in the code and not due to complex cryptographic issues or other high-complexity requirements, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description does not specify that high privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability. Given that it's related to IPC (Inter-Process Communication) and can potentially lead to accessing unexpected parts of memory, it seems feasible that an attacker could exploit this without needing high privileges. Thus, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication in the description that user interaction is necessary for the exploitation of this vulnerability. It appears to be exploitable through the network without requiring any action from a legitimate user.

But given the potential for network-based attacks if the system is reachable and there's an interface to exploit this, **Network (N)** seems more fitting for a conservative assessment.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability involves a specific sequence of events leading to a deadlock, suggesting that exploiting this might not be straightforward and could require specific conditions or sequences of actions. However, the actual complexity of triggering this condition isn't clearly outlined in terms of requiring specialized conditions or not. Given the lack of explicit detail about needing specific, hard-to-achieve conditions, a cautious approach would lean towards **Low (L)**, assuming the exploitability once the vulnerability is understood.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description doesn't specify the privileges required to trigger the deadlock. Given that this is a kernel-level issue, one might assume that elevated privileges could be necessary to interact with the driver in such a way as to cause the deadlock. However, without explicit mention, and considering that some kernel vulnerabilities can be triggered without high privileges if there's a user-accessible pathway, **None (N)** could be considered if assuming the worst-case scenario where no special privileges are needed due to other factors like exposed interfaces or services.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description implies that the deadlock can occur due to internal kernel operations without necessitating direct user interaction beyond perhaps initiating the conditions under which the deadlock occurs (e.g., using a network service). Thus, **None (N)** seems appropriate.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the kernel and doesn't imply an ability to impact resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component itself, **Unchanged (U)** is the correct choice.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**, **Integrity (I)**, and **Availability (A)**: The impact of a deadlock in the kernel could potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, affecting availability. While confidentiality and integrity impacts aren't directly mentioned, a DoS condition primarily suggests an availability issue. Therefore, **High (H)** for Availability seems justified because a successful exploit could significantly impact the system's availability. For Confidentiality and Integrity, without explicit mention of data leakage or modification, **None (N)** might seem appropriate, but considering the potential systemic impact and assuming the worst, one might argue differently. However, strictly based on the description provided, **None (N)** for both Confidentiality and Integrity aligns with the information given.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen values for each metric.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

Starting in version 2.10.0 and prior to version 2.10.2, a specially crafted document could cause an out of bound read, most likely resulting in a crash. Versions prior to 2.10.0 are not vulnerable. Version 2.10.2 fixes the problem. No known workarounds are available.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE, let's analyze each metric based on the provided description:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specially crafted document, which implies that the attack can be initiated over a network if the application using the JSON implementation is exposed. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as it's reasonable to assume the potential for remote exploitation.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions that a \"specially crafted document\" could cause the issue, suggesting that the exploit might require some level of sophistication but does not imply a need for specific conditions or configurations beyond crafting the malicious input. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**, assuming the complexity of crafting such a document is manageable.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: There's no indication that special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability. Given that it involves processing a crafted document, which typically doesn't require elevated permissions, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: Since the vulnerability involves processing a specially crafted document, which can presumably be automated, there's no requirement for user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description does not indicate that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. Hence, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Although the primary impact mentioned is a crash (which relates more to availability), an out-of-bounds read could potentially expose sensitive information. However, since the description primarily focuses on the crash aspect and does not explicitly mention data exposure, choosing **High (H)** might overstate the case without further information. Yet, considering the nature of out-of-bounds reads, there's a potential for unintended data access, so **High (H)** seems justified due to the potential risk, even though it's not explicitly stated.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The description does not directly imply modification of data; instead, it talks about a crash. Integrity impacts usually involve data modification, which isn't clearly indicated here. However, given the lack of explicit outcomes and considering the worst-case scenario where an out-of-bounds read could potentially lead to data corruption (even though not directly stated), one might argue for **High (H)**. But strictly based on the information given, focusing on the crash aspect suggests less direct impact on integrity, making **None (N)** or **Low (L)** plausible. Considering the conservative approach often taken in CVSS scoring and the fact that data integrity wasn't explicitly mentioned as being compromised, **None (N)** seems a safer choice based solely on the description provided.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability is said to \"most likely result in a crash,\" which directly impacts the availability of the service.

A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability during installation, leading to arbitrary folder or file deletion.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we analyze each metric as follows:\n\n- Attack Vector (AV): The vulnerability can be exploited by a local malicious user, which means the attacker needs to have physical or logical access to the system. However, since it doesn't explicitly require physical access or adjacency, and given that \"local\" typically implies the attack is initiated from within the system rather than over a network, the most appropriate choice here seems to be Local (L). But considering the context more closely, if the exploitation happens during installation and assuming that could potentially be triggered remotely through some means (though not directly stated), one might argue for Network (N). Given the information provided focuses on a \"local malicious user,\" the safer interpretation based on the details given leans towards Local (L).\n\n- Attack Complexity (AC): The presence of a race condition suggests that the attack might require specific timing, which could imply a level of complexity. However, the description does not indicate that the attack requires specialized conditions beyond the race condition itself, suggesting that once the vulnerability is understood, exploiting it might not be overly complex. Thus, Low (L) seems a reasonable choice, as it does not specify the need for sophisticated conditions or multiple exploits to be chained together.\n\n- Privileges Required (PR): The description mentions a \"local malicious user,\" which implies that the attacker already has some level of access to the system. However, it does not specify that high privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability. Given that arbitrary folder or file deletion can often be achieved with basic user privileges depending on the system configuration and the specific folders/files targeted, and without explicit mention of needing elevated rights, Low (L) could be considered. Yet, the ability to perform such actions during installation might suggest that no special privileges are needed beyond what a standard user would have during an install process, leaning towards None (N).\n\n- User Interaction (UI): The vulnerability can be exploited during installation, which suggests that user interaction may not be necessary for the exploit to occur, especially if the race condition can be triggered automatically during the install process. Therefore, None (N) seems the most fitting choice.\n\n- Scope (S): There's no indication that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. Hence, Unchanged (U) is the appropriate choice.\n\n- Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A): The vulnerability leads to arbitrary folder or file deletion, which directly impacts the integrity of the system (as data can be modified/deleted) and potentially its availability (if critical files are deleted, leading to system crashes or service unavailability). Confidentiality is less directly impacted since the focus is on deletion rather than exposure of sensitive information. Therefore, High (H) for Integrity (I) and Availability (A) due to the potential significant impact, and Low (L) or None (N) for Confidentiality (C). Considering the primary effect described is deletion, which doesn't directly relate to exposing confidential data but rather to destroying it, Low (L) might be a conservative estimate for Confidentiality.\n\nGiven these considerations, the chosen values are:\n- AV: L (considering the local context, though N could be argued with more remote exploitation detail)\n- AC: L\n- PR: N (given the lack of specification on needing higher privileges)\n- UI: N\n- S: U\n- C: L (acknowledging the deletion primarily affects integrity and availability)\n- I: H\n- A: H\n\nThus, the CVSS v3.1 vector string, taking into account the above justifications and choosing what seems to fit best based on the description provided, would be constructed as follows:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "score": 1.7000000000000002, "success": true}

This scenario implies that the attack can be initiated over the network, as it involves accessing the repository remotely. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The CVE description mentions a race condition, which typically requires specific circumstances to occur. However, it does not imply a need for specialized conditions or systems beyond the described scenario. Given this, the complexity seems relatively straightforward once the initial conditions are met, suggesting **Low (L)** complexity.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: There's no indication that the attacker needs any privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability. The focus is on the race condition allowing unauthorized access to a private repository, implying that **None (N)** privileges are required.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description does not mention any requirement for user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. The exploitation seems to rely solely on the race condition and network accessibility, so **None (N)** is the appropriate choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the confidentiality and integrity of data within the private repository but does not explicitly mention an impact on other resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component (the GitLab EE instance itself), the scope is considered **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The potential for a private repository to be cloned indicates a significant breach of confidentiality, as sensitive data could be accessed by unauthorized parties. Thus, the impact on confidentiality is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: While the primary concern is the unauthorized access (confidentiality), there's also an implication that data integrity could be compromised if the cloned repository is modified and then synchronized back, although this is less directly stated. However, considering the direct impact mentioned is more about access than modification, and assuming the primary risk is reading rather than altering data, one might argue for **Low (L)** or **High (H)** depending on interpretation. Given the context focuses on cloning (implying read access) rather than modification, **Low (L)** might seem appropriate, but since the question emphasizes the potential for significant exposure, **High (H)** could also be justified based on the potential consequences of such access leading to further malicious actions. For the purpose of this analysis, acknowledging the direct mention of cloning (which primarily impacts confidentiality) but also considering potential further risks, **High (H)** is selected to reflect the severity of potential outcomes.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The description does not indicate that the vulnerability would cause a denial-of-service or otherwise affect the availability of the system or data. Thus, the impact on availability is **None (N)**, but considering the potential for significant disruption if repositories are compromised, one might argue differently. However, strictly based on the information given, **None (N)** seems most fitting as the primary impact described is on confidentiality and potentially integrity rather than making the system or data unavailable.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would be constructed as follows:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 3.1999999999999993, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending malicious input through the 'emd_mb_meta' shortcode, which implies interaction over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated remotely.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping,\" suggesting that the vulnerability is relatively straightforward to exploit once the attacker has the necessary privileges. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**, indicating that the attack does not require specialized conditions or systems configurations beyond what is already described.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability requires \"contributor-level access and above\" to exploit, meaning the attacker needs some level of privilege but not the highest. However, since it doesn't specify the need for administrative or high-level privileges explicitly, and considering the context where contributor-level access might not be considered \"high\" in all scenarios, the chosen value could lean towards **Low (L)**. Yet, given the specific mention of \"and above,\" it indicates a need for more than none, but since \"None (N)\" implies no privileges at all and \"High (H)\" typically refers to administrative or very high levels of access, **Low (L)** seems the most fitting based on CVSS definitions, even though in practical terms, contributor access might be seen as somewhat privileged.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability allows attackers to inject scripts that execute when a user accesses an injected page, implying that user interaction (visiting the page) is required for the exploit to have its effect. However, the question asks about interaction from the attacker's perspective, and the exploitation itself doesn't require the attacker to interact with the system in a special way beyond injecting the script initially. Given this nuance and focusing strictly on the attacker's actions, one might argue **None (N)** because the exploit doesn't necessitate ongoing interaction from the attacker after the initial injection. But considering the broader interpretation that includes the necessity of a user's action for the exploit to achieve its goal (execution of the script), there could be confusion. Since the primary focus in CVSS is on the conditions required for the vulnerability to be exploited from the attacker's perspective, and acknowledging that the exploit's effectiveness relies on subsequent user action, the correct interpretation under CVSS guidelines should reflect the nature of the attack itself rather than its consequences. Hence, the chosen value should actually reflect the requirement for user interaction in the exploit process from the perspective of achieving the exploit's impact, leading to **Required (R)** being potentially misleading in this strict context. Upon careful reconsideration, focusing on the fact that the exploit is completed by the attacker without needing further interaction after the initial setup, **None (N)** aligns more closely with CVSS's intent regarding attacker interaction.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the targeted system itself, but there's no indication that it allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. Therefore, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**, as the vulnerability does not change the scope of the attack to other components or resources beyond the immediate target.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The ability to inject arbitrary web scripts could potentially allow attackers to steal sensitive information, thus impacting confidentiality. Given the potential for significant exposure of data, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, the injection of arbitrary scripts could modify data or system settings, thereby affecting integrity. Considering the potential for widespread modification, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impacts mentioned relate to confidentiality and integrity, the injection of scripts could also lead to denial-of-service conditions or other availability issues, depending on the scripts' effects. However, the direct mention of script injection leans more towards confidentiality and integrity impacts.

However, since it doesn't specify high privileges like admin, the chosen value is **Low (L)**, reflecting that some privileges are needed but they are not at the highest level.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description states that the injected scripts will execute \"whenever a user accesses an injected page,\" implying that user interaction (visiting the page) is required for the exploit to have its effect. Therefore, the chosen value is **Required (R)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: There's no indication that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the component being attacked (in this case, the WordPress instance). Hence, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Given that the vulnerability involves injecting arbitrary web scripts, it could potentially lead to unauthorized data access or theft, impacting confidentiality. Considering the potential for significant exposure, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The ability to inject scripts also means the attacker can modify data or settings within the application, affecting its integrity. Similar to confidentiality, the potential impact is significant, so the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impacts mentioned relate to confidentiality and integrity, there's less direct indication of how this vulnerability would affect availability (e.g., causing a denial-of-service condition). However, considering the broad potential of injected scripts, it could indirectly impact availability. Yet, based strictly on the information provided, the most directly related impacts are on confidentiality and integrity. Still, acknowledging the potential for scripts to cause disruptions, the chosen value could lean towards **Low (L)**, but given the nature of XSS attacks, which often don't directly aim at disrupting service but rather at stealing data or taking control, the actual impact might be more nuanced. For simplicity and aligning with typical XSS vulnerabilities, **None (N)** might seem too low given the potential, so **Low (L)** seems a reasonable choice, recognizing that the primary goal isn't typically to disrupt service but acknowledging that complex scripts could have such effects.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen values for each metric.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.1999999999999993, "success": true}

Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by opening a malicious file, which implies the attack vector is not strictly physical or adjacent. Given that the exploitation doesn't necessarily require direct network access but involves interacting with a potentially malicious file that could be delivered over a network, the most fitting choice seems to be **Network (N)**, as it encompasses scenarios where an attacker could send a malicious file to the victim over the internet.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not mention any specific conditions that would make the exploit particularly complex, such as needing specific timings, configurations, or multiple exploits chained together. Therefore, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability results in privilege escalation in the context of the current user, implying that no initial privileges are required beyond those of the current user. However, since it mentions escalation, it suggests the attacker starts with the privileges of the user running Photoshop Elements, which could be considered **None (N)** in terms of requiring no additional privileges to start the exploit, but given the context, it might seem more aligned with **Low (L)** if considering the starting point of the exploit within the user's context. Yet, based on CVSS guidelines, \"None\" fits better because the exploit doesn't require the attacker to have any privileges before exploiting the vulnerability; they're leveraging the user's existing privileges.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description explicitly states that exploitation requires user interaction, specifically that a victim must open a malicious file. Thus, **Required (R)** is the correct choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability leads to privilege escalation within the same user context and does not explicitly mention affecting resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component, the scope is considered **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Privilege escalation could potentially allow access to information that was previously restricted, suggesting an impact on confidentiality. Given the potential for significant exposure depending on the user's role and the system's configuration, the impact could be considered **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: With escalated privileges, an attacker could modify data, leading to a significant integrity impact. Hence, **High (H)** is appropriate.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While not directly mentioned, privilege escalation could potentially lead to actions that affect system availability, such as crashing the system, modifying critical files, etc. Considering the potential for significant disruption, **High (H)** seems fitting.\n\nGiven these choices, the CVSS v3.1 vector string is constructed as follows:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "score": 3.3000000000000007, "success": true}

This is because the attack can be initiated over the network, assuming the attacker has access to the network where the GitLab instance is hosted.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions a \"lack of input validation,\" which suggests that exploiting this vulnerability does not require sophisticated conditions or systems to be in place beyond the existing authentication. Therefore, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: It's stated that the exploit requires an \"authenticated user,\" meaning some level of privilege is needed but not high-level administrative privileges. However, since the requirement is simply being authenticated (which is a basic level of access), this aligns more closely with **Low (L)** privileges required, as the term \"None\" implies no authentication is needed, and \"High\" would imply administrative or very elevated privileges.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that the exploitation of this vulnerability requires any interaction from another user beyond the initial authentication.

The vulnerability arises from improper sanitization of HTML tags in chat history uploads. Specifically, the sanitization logic fails to handle HTML tags within code blocks correctly, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to identity theft or other malicious actions.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability is related to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which typically involves an attack being launched over a network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated remotely over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions that the vulnerability arises from improper sanitization of HTML tags, which suggests that exploiting this vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or systems to be in place beyond what is normally available. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**, indicating that the attack complexity is low.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since this is a stored XSS vulnerability, an attacker does not need any privileges on the system to exploit it; they simply need to upload malicious content that will be executed by other users. Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: For a stored XSS attack, once the malicious script is uploaded to the server, it can execute without requiring further interaction from the victim (other than visiting the affected page).

However, since it involves sending a specific type of packet (`S1AP 'Uplink NAS Transport'`) which implies a level of proximity or adjacency in a network context, the most fitting choice seems to be Adjacent (A). But considering standard interpretations in CVSS where \"network-adjacent\" might be more about the capability to reach the target over networks rather than requiring direct physical adjacency, and given the nature of network protocols involved, a stronger case could be made for Network (N) due to the potential for exploitation over network interfaces. Thus, **AV: N** seems more appropriate upon reconsideration, acknowledging the exploitability through network packets.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability involves sending a specifically crafted packet missing an expected field, which does not seem to require significant computational resources or complex conditions to be met. Therefore, **AC: L** (Low) is justified.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: There's no indication that any special privileges are needed to send such a packet, suggesting **PR: N** (None).\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The exploit involves sending a crafted packet, which does not require interaction from a user of the targeted system.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not indicate any specific complexity in exploiting the vulnerability beyond what is typically required for cross-site scripting attacks. Given that XSS vulnerabilities often require relatively straightforward techniques to exploit, especially when they are of the stored type, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code, suggesting that an attacker could potentially exploit this without needing elevated privileges on the system. Thus, the chosen value is **None (N)**, indicating that no special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: For stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, user interaction is typically required for the exploit to be successful, as the malicious script needs to be executed by the victim's browser. However, since the question asks about the initial exploitation phase which involves storing the malicious script, and considering the nature of stored XSS where the primary concern is the embedding of the script rather than its execution, there might be confusion. But generally, for the impact to occur, a user needs to interact with the affected page. Yet, focusing strictly on the action of embedding the script, one might argue **None (N)** if considering automated processes or the act of storing itself. Given the context usually implies the necessity of a user to trigger the exploit indirectly by viewing the affected page, but acknowledging the direct action described is the embedding, the correct interpretation in CVSS terms for such vulnerabilities tends towards **None (N)** because the question focuses on the exploitability aspect directly related to the vulnerability itself.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description mentions altering the intended functionality and potential credentials disclosure within a trusted session, which suggests that the impact is confined to the security scope of the component being attacked (the web application). There's no indication that the vulnerability would allow an attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. Therefore, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability could lead to credentials disclosure, which directly impacts confidentiality.

Since the impact on integrity can be significant due to the ability to alter functionality and potentially steal or modify sensitive data, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impacts mentioned relate to confidentiality and integrity, there's no explicit mention of how this vulnerability would directly affect the availability of the system or service. However, considering the broad potential impacts of arbitrary code execution (even if primarily focused on stored XSS), one might consider availability could be impacted indirectly through denial-of-service scenarios or other means. Yet, based strictly on the information given, the focus is more on confidentiality and integrity.

This is due to missing nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary results via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited over the network by sending a forged request, which means the attacker does not need to be physically present or have local access to the system. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The attack complexity is considered low because exploiting the vulnerability requires minimal conditions—tricking a site administrator into performing an action like clicking on a link—and does not involve complex mechanisms or significant resources. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to perform actions (deleting arbitrary results) by tricking a site administrator, no privileges are required initially for the exploit. However, the success of the exploit depends on tricking an administrator, implying that while the attacker themselves doesn't need privileges, the impact is elevated because it involves administrative actions indirectly. Despite this nuance, according to CVSS guidelines, if the vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, **None (N)** is the appropriate choice.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The exploit requires a site administrator to perform an action (like clicking on a link) for the attack to succeed. Therefore, user interaction is necessary, making the chosen value **Required (R)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description does not indicate that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (the Tripetto plugin for WordPress). Hence, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Although the primary impact mentioned is the deletion of arbitrary results, which affects integrity, confidentiality could also be impacted if sensitive information is among the deleted data or if the deletion itself reveals sensitive information about what was stored. Given the potential for revealing or modifying sensitive data through deletion, the chosen value could lean towards **High (H)**, considering the potential for significant data exposure or modification through the deletion mechanism.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The vulnerability explicitly allows attackers to delete arbitrary results, directly impacting the integrity of the data. This significant alteration of data without authorization warrants a **High (H)** impact on integrity.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary focus is on data integrity through deletion, the availability of specific data or services could be impacted if critical results are deleted, potentially disrupting operations or access to necessary information. However, since the direct impact described is more aligned with data modification rather than denying service, the chosen value might be **Low (L)** or **High (H)** depending on how critical the deleted data is to system operation.

Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/628404/\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to analyze the information provided and determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: Given that this vulnerability involves the Linux kernel and specifically mentions a function related to the display driver (`drm/msm/dpu`), which could potentially be exploited through user-space interactions but does not explicitly require physical access or adjacency, the most likely attack vector would be over the network if there's an exposed service or interface that can trigger this condition. However, since the description doesn't explicitly mention remote exploitation capabilities, and considering typical scenarios where such vulnerabilities might be more locally exploitable due to the nature of the subsystem affected, one might lean towards Local (L). But, because the potential for network-based attacks cannot be entirely ruled out without further context on how `dpu_plane_atomic_print_state()` is accessed or triggered, and acknowledging that many modern exploits can leverage network vectors even for what seems like local issues, the safer assumption here aligns with considering the possibility of network exploitation. Thus, **Network (N)** seems a reasonable choice given the broad applicability and potential for creative exploitation techniques.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description implies a specific condition under which the vulnerability occurs (\"when the state is dumped without a corresponding atomic_check()\"), suggesting that exploiting this issue might require certain prerequisites or specific system states to be met. This indicates that the attack complexity could be higher than low. Therefore, **High (H)** seems appropriate.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability is described within the context of the Linux kernel and specifically relates to a driver component, exploiting this might not necessarily require high privileges initially, especially if the vulnerable code path can be reached from user space. However, without explicit details on whether user-space applications can directly interact with this functionality in a manner that would lead to exploitation, one might consider the requirement for elevated privileges to effectively exploit kernel-level vulnerabilities. Yet, given the lack of clear indication that high privileges are necessary for the initial exploitation attempt, **None (N)** could be considered, assuming the vulnerability can indeed be triggered from user space without needing root or equivalent privileges.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is required for this vulnerability to be exploited. The description focuses on internal kernel operations rather than user-initiated actions. Thus, **None (N)** is the most fitting choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability appears to affect components within the same privilege boundary (i.e., within the kernel itself), and there's no mention of it affecting resources or components outside its immediate scope in a way that would suggest a change in scope. Hence, **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: While the primary impact isn't explicitly stated, vulnerabilities involving NULL pointer dereferences can sometimes lead to information disclosure, depending on what data is accessible via the dereferenced pointer. Without explicit confirmation of confidentiality impact, but considering potential implications, **Low (L)** might seem a cautious estimate, though **None (N)** could also be argued if no direct confidentiality breach is anticipated.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, integrity impact might occur if an attacker could manipulate data through this vulnerability, but the description primarily highlights a NULL pointer dereference, which typically suggests a denial-of-service or potentially an information disclosure scenario rather than direct data modification. Still, the potential for some level of integrity compromise cannot be dismissed outright without further analysis, so **Low (L)** could be a reasonable selection, acknowledging that direct integrity impacts aren't clearly outlined.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: A NULL pointer dereference can lead to a crash or freeze of the affected component or even the entire system, indicating a potential high impact on availability.

Since this can be exploited over the network by potentially intercepting or manipulating the communication between the app and the server, the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**.\n  \n- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Given that the verification token is hardcoded into the app, an attacker would not need specialized conditions or systems to exploit this vulnerability beyond obtaining the token. Thus, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n- **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description does not indicate that any specific privileges are needed to access the hardcoded token within the app. Therefore, **None (N)** is the most fitting choice, as an attacker could potentially exploit this without needing any elevated privileges.\n\n- **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no mention of requiring user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker could potentially exploit the hardcoded token without needing the user to perform any actions. Hence, **None (N)** is chosen.\n\n- **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability seems to affect the confidentiality and integrity of data sent through the goTenna server but does not imply an impact on other resources beyond the immediate scope of the vulnerable component. Therefore, **Unchanged (U)** is selected, assuming the attack does not allow the attacker to impact resources beyond the goTenna service itself.\n\n- **Confidentiality (C)**: The ability to send SMS using a hardcoded token could compromise sensitive information, implying a significant impact on confidentiality. Thus, **High (H)** is chosen.\n\n- **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, being able to send SMS could allow an attacker to manipulate or alter messages, affecting their integrity. So, **High (H)** is also chosen for Integrity.\n\n- **Availability (A)**: While the primary impacts seem related to confidentiality and integrity, there's potential for availability issues if the exploitation leads to service disruption or misuse of the SMS service, overwhelming it.

Yet, considering the potential for abuse, **High (H)** might still be argued due to the potential for disrupting the service through malicious use, but traditionally, such vulnerabilities are more closely associated with confidentiality and integrity impacts. Given the nature of the vulnerability, though, and focusing strictly on the provided details without assuming additional potential impacts, one might lean towards a lower impact on availability directly from the description alone.

Justification: The attack can originate from a remote location, targeting the system through the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions a specific flaw in the parsing of JP2 files due to the lack of validation, suggesting that exploiting this vulnerability might not require significant conditions beyond the initial exploitation vector.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated over the network without requiring local or physical access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping,\" which suggests that exploiting this vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or systems configurations beyond what is normally present in a default setup. Thus, the complexity of the attack is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: According to the description, the attacker needs to have \"contributor-level access and above\" to exploit the vulnerability. This implies that some level of privilege is required but not the highest level (which would typically correspond to administrative or root access).

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated over the network, assuming the system is accessible remotely.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of the attack is relatively low since it involves a straightforward series of steps (creating an ext4 image, clearing the resize_inode feature, mounting it, and then attempting to resize) that can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would likely need privileges to create, modify, and mount file systems, which typically requires root or elevated permissions. However, considering the context might allow for exploitation through specific configurations or vulnerabilities in user-space applications that interact with the kernel, the conservative approach based on the information provided leans towards requiring some level of privilege. Yet, given the nature of the exploit involving direct interaction with file system structures, the chosen value is **None (N)**, acknowledging that the primary vulnerability lies in the kernel's handling rather than in user-level permissions, though in practice, administrative privileges would be needed to perform these actions.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The exploit does not require any interaction from another user beyond the initial setup and execution of the exploit sequence. Hence, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the kernel and its handling of file system operations, and there's no indication that it would affect resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component (in this case, the ext4 file system within the Linux kernel), the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The impact on confidentiality isn't directly mentioned, but given the nature of the vulnerability (a NULL pointer dereference), it's plausible that sensitive data could be exposed or accessed improperly due to the potential for arbitrary code execution or data leakage. Therefore, the chosen value is **High (H)**, considering the worst-case scenario where an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to expose sensitive information.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to confidentiality, the integrity of the system could be compromised, as an attacker exploiting this vulnerability might be able to modify data or execute arbitrary code, leading to a significant impact on system integrity. Thus, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service condition (e.g., crashing the system or making it unstable) due to the NULL pointer dereference, which would affect the availability of the system. Given this potential, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\nGiven these choices, the CVSS v3.1 vector string is constructed as follows:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 4.300000000000001, "success": true}

However, this approach created a race condition between the DRM scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence is signaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed. This results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns a new job to the pointer. This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns it to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an interrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.

Given that this issue can be triggered locally on the system without needing to come from an external network, but considering the nature of the vulnerability which doesn't strictly require physical access or adjacency, the most fitting choice seems to be **Local (L)**. However, since the vulnerability can potentially be exploited through a local application or service running on the system without direct physical interaction, and considering the broader interpretation of attack vectors in CVSS, **Network (N)** could also be argued if one considers the potential for remote exploitation via a compromised local process or service. But based strictly on the information provided, **Local (L)** seems more appropriate due to the lack of explicit mention of network-based exploitation vectors.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability involves exploiting a race condition, which generally requires specific timing and possibly repeated attempts to succeed. However, the description does not imply that the exploit requires specialized conditions beyond the ability to run a process on the affected system. Thus, the complexity might seem **Low (L)** because once the race condition is understood, exploiting it might not require significant additional complexity, though in practice, race conditions can be challenging to reliably exploit.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability is in the kernel, and exploiting it leads to a crash, suggesting that it could potentially be used to gain elevated privileges. However, the description indicates that the issue can cause a crash when triggered by a user-space application (`chromium`), implying that **None (N)** or **Low (L)** privileges might suffice to trigger the vulnerability. Given the context, **None (N)** seems most appropriate as the vulnerability can be triggered without requiring any special privileges initially.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability can be triggered without requiring user interaction beyond running an application that exercises the vulnerable code path. Therefore, **None (N)** is the correct choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the kernel and could potentially allow an attacker to impact resources beyond the scope of their normal privileges, but there's no clear indication that it allows the attacker to affect other spheres (like moving from a container to the host in a containerized environment), **Unchanged (U)** seems the most fitting choice based on the information provided.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: There's no direct indication that the vulnerability would allow an attacker to read sensitive data they shouldn't have access to. While a crash could potentially reveal some information, the primary impact described is a denial-of-service rather than a confidentiality breach. Thus, **None (N)** seems appropriate, but considering the potential for information disclosure in certain scenarios, **Low (L)** could also be considered. Given the focus on the crash and lack of explicit mention of data leakage, **None (N)** is chosen.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to Confidentiality, there's no clear indication that the vulnerability directly allows modification of data. The primary effect is a crash, which doesn't inherently imply data integrity compromise. Hence, **None (N)** is selected, though one might argue for **Low (L)** if considering potential side effects of a crash on system stability and data consistency.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability clearly causes a system crash, which directly impacts availability. Therefore, **High (H)** is the most appropriate choice, as the system becomes unavailable upon exploitation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would be constructed as follows:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.5, "success": true}

Since this can be done over the network without needing physical or local access, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not imply that the attack requires special conditions or sophisticated techniques beyond exploiting the lack of input sanitization. Therefore, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: There's no indication that the attacker needs any privileges on the system to exploit this vulnerability. Thus, **None (N)** is the appropriate choice.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: For a cross-site scripting attack, user interaction is often required, such as clicking on a link or submitting a form that contains malicious code. However, since XSS can also be exploited without direct user interaction (e.g., via persistent XSS where the malicious script is stored on the server and executed whenever a user visits the page), and considering the context might allow for such scenarios, the conservative approach would consider **None (N)**, assuming the most severe case where no user interaction is needed for exploitation.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data within the same security scope as the vulnerable component. There's no mention of the ability to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component, so **Unchanged (U)** is selected.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Cross-site scripting attacks can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as session cookies or other confidential data. Given the potential for significant exposure of user data, **High (H)** is chosen.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, XSS attacks can modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user, affecting data integrity. Considering the potential impact, **High (H)** is selected.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While XSS primarily affects confidentiality and integrity, in some cases, it could potentially be used to disrupt service or make data unavailable. However, the primary impact described here relates more directly to confidentiality and integrity rather than availability. Still, considering the broad potential impacts of XSS, **High (H)** could be argued, but traditionally, XSS is more closely associated with confidentiality and integrity impacts. Given the focus on data compromise rather than denial of service, a more conservative interpretation might lean towards **Low (L)** or even **None (N)** if strictly interpreting the typical outcomes of XSS.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of exploiting this vulnerability is considered low because XSS vulnerabilities, especially reflected ones, often require little to no special conditions to exploit beyond tricking a user into performing an action. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since this is a reflected XSS vulnerability, it does not require any privileges on the system to exploit. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability without needing any specific permissions or access rights. Hence, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: For a reflected XSS attack to be successful, user interaction is required. The victim must be tricked into clicking a malicious link, submitting a malicious form, etc., for the exploit to work. Therefore, the chosen value is **Required (R)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The scope of this vulnerability is unchanged because it affects the same security scope in which the vulnerability occurs. There's no indication that this vulnerability allows an attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. So, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: A successful exploitation of an XSS vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to steal sensitive information such as session cookies, thereby compromising confidentiality. Considering the potential impact, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, an XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, modifying data or performing unauthorized transactions, thus affecting integrity. Given this potential, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While XSS attacks are more commonly associated with confidentiality and integrity impacts, in some scenarios, they could potentially be used to disrupt service or cause denial-of-service conditions, though this is less common. However, considering the primary impacts are on confidentiality and integrity, and there's no explicit mention of availability being affected, one might argue for **None (N)** or **Low (L)**. But since the question asks for a calculation based on provided details and given the nature of XSS, which is less about causing direct availability issues compared to other types of attacks, the conservative approach aligns with **None (N)**, acknowledging that significant availability impacts are less characteristic of XSS.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen values for each metric.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

This issue is fixed in iPadOS 17.7.4, iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3. Restoring a maliciously crafted backup file may lead to modification of protected system files.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we analyze each metric step by step:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The attack involves restoring a maliciously crafted backup file, which implies that the attack can be initiated remotely if the backup file is provided or accessed over a network. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**, as it encompasses attacks that can be launched over a network, including the internet.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of the attack seems to be straightforward, involving the restoration of a malicious backup file. There's no indication of specific conditions or configurations needed beyond having access to the device and the ability to restore backups. Thus, **Low (L)** is the suitable choice.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability allows for the modification of protected system files upon restoring a malicious backup, it suggests that the attacker does not need high privileges to initiate the attack but rather exploits a flaw in the handling process. However, considering typical scenarios where backups are restored, some level of access or privilege might be assumed, yet the description doesn't explicitly require high privileges for the exploit itself. Given this context, **None (N)** could be considered because the focus is on the exploitability of the vulnerability through crafted backups rather than leveraging existing high privileges.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The attack requires the restoration of a maliciously crafted backup file, which implies some form of user interaction—either directly or indirectly—to initiate the exploit. However, since the primary action (restoring a backup) could potentially be automated or scripted once the malicious file is in place, and considering the description focuses on the outcome rather than the interaction, one might argue for **None (N)**. Yet, given the nature of the attack typically involves someone choosing to restore a backup, **Required (R)** seems more fitting upon reevaluation, acknowledging that some user action is necessary to trigger the exploit.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects system files, indicating that the impact is confined within the scope of the vulnerable component itself. There's no mention of the vulnerability allowing the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of control of the vulnerable component. Hence, **Unchanged (U)** is the correct choice.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The modification of protected system files could imply potential access to sensitive information, suggesting an impact on confidentiality. Given the severity of modifying system files, **High (H)** seems like an appropriate choice, as significant data could be compromised.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The direct modification of protected system files clearly indicates a high impact on integrity, as critical system components are altered. Thus, **High (H)** is the suitable selection.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impact described is on confidentiality and integrity due to file modifications, there's no explicit mention of the system becoming unavailable or denied service due to the exploit. However, considering the potential consequences of altering system files, it could lead to system instability or crashes, affecting availability. Given this, **High (H)** could be argued, but without explicit denial-of-service implications, this might lean towards a lower impact.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into pages that users access, which implies the attack can be initiated over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping,\" which suggests that exploiting this vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or systems to be in place beyond what is normally available. Thus, the complexity of the attack is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Although the description states that attackers need \"contributor-level access and above\" to exploit the vulnerability, within the context of CVSS, requiring authentication but not high privileges aligns more closely with **Low (L)** privileges required, since contributor-level access is not typically considered high privilege in most systems.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability involves injecting scripts that execute when a user accesses an injected page, meaning that while user interaction (visiting the page) is necessary for the exploit to have its effect, the initial exploitation by the attacker does not require direct interaction from the victim beyond normal use of the system. However, because the question asks about user interaction in terms of the attack being successful (i.e., the script executing), and considering the strict definitions provided, the correct interpretation under CVSS guidelines would actually consider this as **None (N)**, since the user's action (browsing to the page) is not an interaction with the exploit itself but rather a condition for the exploit's impact to occur.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data within the same security scope (the WordPress site), the scope is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Given that arbitrary web scripts can be injected and executed, sensitive information could potentially be accessed or stolen, indicating a significant impact on confidentiality. Therefore, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The ability to inject arbitrary scripts allows for modification of data presented to users, affecting the integrity of the information displayed on the website. Hence, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impacts described relate to confidentiality and integrity, the injection of arbitrary scripts could also lead to denial-of-service conditions or other disruptions, affecting the availability of the service. Considering the potential for such impacts, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string is constructed as follows:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 3.4000000000000004, "success": true}

This issue can be exploited remotely if the system is reachable over the network, which is common for many Linux systems acting as servers or otherwise exposed to the internet. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**, as an attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability over a network without needing local or physical access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions a memory leak that occurs under specific conditions (when `device_register()` fails). Exploiting a memory leak often requires some level of sophistication but does not necessarily imply high complexity in terms of the conditions required for the attack itself. However, given that the vulnerability involves understanding of low-level system interactions and potentially crafting specific inputs or sequences to reliably trigger and exploit the leak, the complexity might lean towards being more involved. Yet, considering the nature of the vulnerability and typical exploitation paths, **Low (L)** seems a reasonable choice because once the conditions are met, exploiting the vulnerability might not require significant additional complexity beyond what's typically involved in such exploits.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability is described in the context of kernel operations, suggesting that exploiting it could potentially allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges. However, the description focuses on a memory leak rather than direct privilege escalation. Given the lack of explicit mention of requiring or gaining privileges, and considering the nature of the vulnerability, one might initially consider **None (N)**. But, since the impact could potentially lead to situations where an attacker gains advantages due to information disclosure or other secondary effects, careful consideration is needed. Still, the primary description points towards an issue that doesn't inherently require initial privileged access to exploit, so **None (N)** seems appropriate.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is necessary for the vulnerability to be exploited. The scenario described involves system-level operations (`device_register()` failing), which suggests that **None (N)** is the correct choice, as user interaction is not required for the vulnerability to be triggered.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the kernel, which operates within the same scope as the vulnerable component. There's no indication that the vulnerability would allow an attacker to impact resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component itself. Thus, **Unchanged (U)** is the appropriate choice, as the vulnerability does not change the scope of the attack impact.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: A memory leak can potentially disclose sensitive information. Depending on what data is leaked, this could range from low to high impact. Given the potential for disclosing sensitive kernel memory contents, **High (H)** seems like a reasonable choice, as even limited disclosures can have significant security implications.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to confidentiality, integrity could be impacted if an attacker can manipulate the system based on the leaked information or use it to execute malicious code. The potential for **High (H)** impact exists because exploiting such vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution or modification of critical system data.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary concern with memory leaks is often confidentiality or integrity, in severe cases, they can also affect availability if the leak leads to system instability or crashes. However, the description does not explicitly suggest that the primary impact would be on system availability. Considering the nature of the vulnerability, **High (H)** might seem less directly applicable compared to confidentiality and integrity impacts, yet the potential for significant disruption cannot be ruled out entirely, especially if the leak is exploitable in a way that causes system crashes or freezes. Thus, considering the broad potential impacts of such a vulnerability, **High (H)** could be argued, aligning with the potential severity of confidentiality and integrity impacts.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen values for each metric.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 4.300000000000001, "success": true}

Since the attack does not require physical or local access but can be performed over the network, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions a misconfigured capability check, which suggests that exploiting this vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or sophisticated techniques beyond what an authenticated user could typically perform. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Although the vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated with at least Subscriber-level access, this still implies that some privileges are needed. However, since Subscriber-level access is considered relatively low in terms of privilege escalation within the context of WordPress roles, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that the exploitation of this vulnerability requires any interaction from another user beyond the initial authentication of the attacker.

Given the sensitivity of such information, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: While the primary impact mentioned is on confidentiality, there's no direct reference to the ability to modify data. However, considering the potential consequences of exposing donor information and the nature of the vulnerability, one might argue for some level of integrity impact due to the potential for subsequent manipulation based on exposed data. Yet, strictly according to the description provided, the focus is on exposure rather than modification, so the chosen value is **Low (L)**, acknowledging that the primary concern is confidentiality but recognizing the potential for secondary integrity issues.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: There's no mention of the vulnerability affecting the availability of the system or service.

Given that this issue can be exploited over the network without requiring physical or local access, the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions a data race condition that can be exploited when `sysctl_igmp_llm_reports` is read concurrently while being changed. This suggests that exploiting the vulnerability might not require significant computational power or complex conditions, making **Low (L)** the suitable choice.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability involves manipulating system settings (`sysctl_igmp_llm_reports`) within the kernel, an attacker would likely need some level of privilege to exploit this vulnerability effectively. However, given the nature of the vulnerability described, it seems more aligned with needing no special privileges to initiate the attack from the network side, thus **None (N)** could be considered. But considering typical scenarios where such vulnerabilities are exploited, and the fact that interaction with system settings is involved, one might argue for **Low (L)**. Yet, based strictly on the information provided and focusing on the initial exploitation vector, **None (N)** seems more fitting because the primary concern is the network accessibility rather than the privileges needed to interact with the setting directly.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is required for this vulnerability to be exploited. It appears to be exploitable through network interactions alone, making **None (N)** the correct choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the Linux kernel, specifically its networking component. There's no mention of the vulnerability allowing an attacker to impact resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component itself, suggesting **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Although the primary impact isn't explicitly stated, vulnerabilities involving race conditions around system settings like `sysctl_igmp_llm_reports` could potentially lead to unauthorized disclosure of information due to improper handling of sensitive data. Without explicit details on confidentiality impact, but considering potential implications, **High (H)** might seem excessive without direct evidence, so **Low (L)** could be a conservative estimate, acknowledging that there could indeed be some form of information exposure.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Given the nature of the vulnerability, which involves concurrent modification and reading of system settings, there's a potential for integrity compromise, as an attacker could manipulate these settings in unintended ways. Thus, **High (H)** seems justified due to the potential for significant disruption or alteration of system behavior.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: Similar to integrity, the availability of the system or service could be impacted if an attacker exploits this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service or disrupt normal operation.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated remotely.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description indicates a specific condition (passing a `clid` of 0 to `ets_class_from_arg()`) that leads to an out-of-bounds indexing issue, suggesting that the attack complexity might not be high since it involves exploiting a particular vulnerability rather than requiring complex conditions or configurations. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability allows for local privilege escalation, meaning the attacker needs initial access to the system but does not require high privileges to exploit the vulnerability. However, since it's about escalating privileges from a potentially low-privileged account to higher ones, the requirement is **None (N)** because the exploitation starts from a position that doesn't necessarily have elevated privileges initially.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is required for the exploitation of this vulnerability. It seems to be exploitable through network interactions without needing the target user to perform any specific actions. Hence, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Given that this vulnerability affects the Linux kernel and could potentially allow an attacker to escalate privileges, it implies that the impact is confined within the scope of the vulnerable component itself. There's no explicit mention of the vulnerability allowing the attacker to impact resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component. Therefore, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Since the vulnerability allows for privilege escalation, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information. This would imply a significant impact on confidentiality. Thus, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: With escalated privileges, an attacker could modify system files, settings, or data, leading to a significant impact on the integrity of the system.

A SQL Injection vulnerability was identified in versions prior to 3.4.6 in the `idatendido_familiares` parameter of the `/html/funcionario/dependente_editarDoc.php` endpoint. This vulnerability allows attacker to manipulate SQL queries and access sensitive database information, such as table names and sensitive data. Version 3.4.6 fixes the issue.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE, we need to determine the values for each base metric based on the description provided.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the `/html/funcionario/dependente_editarDoc.php` endpoint, which implies that the attack can be launched over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the vulnerability is accessible over the network without requiring local or physical access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not mention any specific conditions or complexities that an attacker would need to overcome other than exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability itself. Given this, the chosen value is **Low (L)**, indicating that the attack does not require specialized conditions or systems configurations beyond what is typically found.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: There's no indication that the attacker needs any privileges to exploit this vulnerability. Thus, the chosen value is **None (N)**, suggesting that the vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication or privilege escalation.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description doesn't imply that user interaction is necessary for the exploitation of the vulnerability. Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**, meaning the attack can be automated and does not rely on social engineering tactics to trick users into performing certain actions.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the database and potentially allows access to sensitive information but does not explicitly mention impacting resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**. This indicates that the vulnerability does not allow the attacker to impact components or resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable application.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability allows attackers to access sensitive database information, including table names and data. This directly impacts confidentiality, so the chosen value is **High (H)**, reflecting the potential for significant disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: While the primary impact mentioned is on confidentiality, SQL injection vulnerabilities often also allow for modification of data, thereby affecting integrity. However, since the description primarily focuses on accessing sensitive information rather than modifying it, but considering the nature of SQL injection attacks, the chosen value is **High (H)**, acknowledging the potential for data modification.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: There's no explicit mention of the vulnerability allowing the attacker to disrupt service or affect availability directly. However, SQL injection attacks could potentially lead to denial-of-service conditions or crashes if not properly handled. Despite this, based strictly on the information given, which emphasizes data access, the chosen value might lean towards **None (N)** or **Low (L)**. Considering the potential indirect impact on availability due to the nature of SQL injection, a conservative approach might select **Low (L)**, but given the emphasis on data access without explicit mention of service disruption, **None (N)** seems more aligned with the provided details.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen values for each metric.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.29999999999999893, "success": true}

An unsafe reading of environment file could potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. When loaded on an Windows application, Netty attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file, the Netty application crash. A similar issue was previously reported as CVE-2024-47535. This issue was fixed, but the fix was incomplete in that null-bytes were not counted against the input limit. Commit d1fbda62d3a47835d3fb35db8bd42ecc205a5386 contains an updated fix.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by creating a large file that causes the Netty application to crash when it attempts to load this file. Since this can be done over the network by manipulating files that the application tries to access, the attack vector is Network. Therefore, **AV: N** (Network).\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of the attack is Low because creating a large file to cause a denial of service does not require specialized conditions or sophisticated techniques beyond understanding how the vulnerability works. Thus, **AC: L** (Low).\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description suggests that no special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability since it involves creating a file that the application will attempt to read, which can presumably be done by any user. Hence, **PR: N** (None).\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is required for the exploitation of this vulnerability. The creation of a large file to cause a denial of service can be automated or done without direct user involvement in the vulnerable system. So, **UI: N** (None).\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the same scope as the vulnerable component (Netty), and there's no mention of it affecting resources beyond its own scope. Therefore, **S: U** (Unchanged).\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: While the primary impact described is a denial of service, there's no explicit mention of confidentiality being affected directly through data exposure due to this specific vulnerability. However, considering the nature of the vulnerability (involving file handling), if sensitive information is handled improperly during the crash, it might indirectly affect confidentiality. Given the lack of clear evidence, a conservative approach would lean towards **C: L** (Low) due to potential indirect impacts, but based strictly on the provided details focusing on DoS, one might argue **C: N**. For calculation purposes and considering potential implications, let's consider **C: L**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to Confidentiality, the primary focus is on availability (denial of service). However, if the application's integrity is compromised by causing it to crash or behave unexpectedly due to improper file handling, then integrity could be considered affected. Yet, the direct impact mentioned is more about availability than altering data. Thus, conservatively, **I: L** (Low), acknowledging that the main concern is not data modification but rather system stability.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability explicitly allows for a denial of service, where the application crashes upon attempting to load a specially crafted large file. This directly impacts the availability of the service. Therefore, **A: H** (High).\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen values for each metric.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 3.0999999999999996, "success": true}

To fix this, a 0 element was added at the end of the array to break the for loop.

Given the nature of the exploit, the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)** because it reflects the ability to exploit the vulnerability from an external source without requiring physical access or adjacency.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The attack complexity is considered **Low (L)** because exploiting this vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or complex sequences of events beyond sending crafted input to trigger the stack-out-of-bounds read.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability resides in a kernel driver and can cause a crash, potentially allowing for privilege escalation or code execution, the initial assumption might lean towards requiring some level of privileges. However, considering the nature of the bug and typical exploitation paths for such vulnerabilities, **None (N)** is chosen because an attacker could potentially exploit this without needing any privileges on the system initially, leveraging the vulnerability to gain elevated access.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability does not require any user interaction to be exploited; an attacker can send malicious input directly to the affected component. Therefore, **None (N)** is the correct choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Given that the vulnerability affects a kernel component and its exploitation could lead to system-wide impacts but does not explicitly mention affecting resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component itself, **Unchanged (U)** seems the most fitting. This choice assumes the impact remains within the scope of the vulnerable component's normal operation.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Although the primary effect described is a crash due to a stack-out-of-bounds read, such vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged to disclose sensitive information. However, based on the provided description focusing on the crash rather than data leakage, choosing **High (H)** might seem less justified without explicit mention of confidentiality impact. Yet, considering potential exploitation paths for similar vulnerabilities, **High (H)** could still be argued if assuming the worst-case scenario where an attacker could leverage this for information disclosure or other confidentiality breaches.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to Confidentiality, while the immediate description focuses on a crash, vulnerabilities like these can potentially be used to modify system behavior or data, especially if exploited creatively. Thus, **High (H)** is chosen under the assumption that an attacker could manipulate system integrity through clever exploitation.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability causes a kernel crash, which directly impacts system availability.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into pages that users access, which implies the attack can be initiated over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping,\" which suggests that exploiting this vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or systems to be in place beyond what is normally available. Thus, the complexity of the attack is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Although the description states that attackers need \"contributor-level access and above\" to exploit the vulnerability, within the context of CVSS, requiring authentication but not high privileges aligns more closely with **Low (L)** privileges required, since contributor-level access is not typically considered high privilege in most systems, especially when compared to administrative or root access.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability involves injecting scripts that execute when a user accesses an injected page, meaning that for the impact to occur, a user must interact with the compromised page. However, the question asks about interaction from the attacker's perspective. Since the attacker can inject the script without further interaction needed from them once the initial injection is done, the correct interpretation here focuses on whether the vulnerability requires the attacker to trick a user into performing some action to exploit it. Given the nature of stored XSS, the answer might seem to lean towards **Required (R)** because a user must visit the page. But considering the CVSS definition closely, the emphasis is on whether the attacker needs the user to perform an action beyond normal use (like clicking a link in phishing). In stored XSS, the mere act of visiting is enough, so it doesn't fit the CVSS definition of requiring user interaction for exploitation in the way phishing does. Hence, the chosen value should actually reflect the nature of the attack being exploitable without needing the user to perform an additional action prompted by the attacker, leading to **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability allows for the execution of scripts within the context of the WordPress site where the plugin is installed. There's no indication that this vulnerability would allow an attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (the WordPress site itself). Therefore, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) can lead to the theft of sensitive information such as session cookies, allowing an attacker to impersonate the victim. This represents a significant breach of confidentiality. Hence, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, XSS attacks can modify data on the website or perform actions on behalf of the user, affecting the integrity of the system. Given the potential for arbitrary script execution, the impact on integrity is also **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While XSS primarily affects confidentiality and integrity, there's less direct implication on availability. However, depending on the scripts executed, it could potentially lead to denial-of-service conditions or other availability impacts. Yet, based on typical CVSS scoring for XSS vulnerabilities, unless explicitly stated otherwise, the primary concerns are confidentiality and integrity.

It triggers a NULL pointer dereference in the periodic tick code. This happens because the legacy timer interrupt (IRQ0) is resent in software which happens in soft interrupt (tasklet) context. In this context get_irq_regs() returns NULL which leads to the NULL pointer dereference. The reason for the resend is a spurious APIC interrupt on the IRQ0 vector which is captured and leads to a resend when the legacy timer interrupt is enabled. This is wrong because the legacy PIC interrupts are level triggered and therefore should never be resent in software, but nothing ever sets the IRQ_LEVEL flag on those interrupts, so the core code does not know about their trigger type. Ensure that IRQ_LEVEL is set when the legacy PCI interrupts are set up.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specific inputs to the system, potentially causing a crash and subsequent failure to boot. Given this scenario, the attack vector is over the network. Therefore, **AV: N (Network)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The exploitability of this vulnerability doesn't require specialized conditions or systems to be in place beyond what's normally present in a standard configuration. Thus, the complexity is considered low. **AC: L (Low)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description suggests that no special privileges are needed to trigger the condition leading to the NULL pointer dereference and subsequent system failure. **PR: N (None)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is required for the exploitation of this vulnerability. The issue seems to stem from system-level operations and interrupt handling. **UI: N (None)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the system's ability to boot properly after a crash and involves system-level components like interrupts, but there's no clear indication that it allows an attacker to impact resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component itself, the scope is unchanged. **S: U (Unchanged)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: While the primary impact described is related to availability (system crashing and failing to boot), there isn't explicit mention of sensitive data being exposed due to this vulnerability. However, considering the potential for system compromise and data exposure in such scenarios, one might argue for some level of confidentiality impact. Yet, based strictly on the information provided, the direct impact on confidentiality isn't clearly outlined, suggesting **C: H (High)** could be considered if assuming potential for data exposure during system instability, but more accurately, without explicit details on data leakage, **C: L (Low)** might be more appropriate. Given the nature of the question, let's proceed with **C: H (High)** for the sake of demonstrating a thorough analysis, acknowledging this might slightly overestimate the impact based solely on the description provided.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to confidentiality, the integrity impact isn't directly stated but could be inferred due to the system's compromised state post-exploitation. Again, assuming potential for data modification during system instability, **I: H (High)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability clearly impacts the system's availability since it can cause the system to fail to boot after a crash, directly affecting its availability. **A: H (High)**.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen values for each metric.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 4.300000000000001, "success": true}

Starting in version 14.0.0 and prior to versions 14.3.2 and 15.1.2, authenticated users are able to exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability when viewing certain localized backoffice components. Versions 14.3.2 and 15.1.2 contain a patch.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by interacting with the Umbraco backoffice, which implies network access is required to reach the system. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not mention any specific conditions that would make the attack complex, such as needing specific timings or multiple systems. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**, indicating that the attack does not require sophisticated conditions beyond exploiting the vulnerability itself.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description states that \"authenticated users\" can exploit the vulnerability. This means some level of privilege is required, but since it's not specifying administrative or high-level privileges, the chosen value is **Low (L)**, reflecting that basic authentication is sufficient.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability involves viewing certain localized backoffice components, implying that user interaction (in this case, an authenticated user viewing specific parts of the application) is necessary for the exploit. However, considering the context more closely, the fact that it's a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability typically means the interaction is with the vulnerable component rather than requiring an additional action from another user. Given the nature of XSS, it often doesn't require direct interaction from the victim beyond being tricked into accessing a malicious link or page. But since the exploit here seems to involve the authenticated user directly interacting with the backoffice to trigger the vulnerability, there might be confusion. For XSS, especially in the context provided, the requirement for user interaction can sometimes be nuanced. Yet, traditionally, XSS vulnerabilities do require some form of user interaction to initiate the attack chain, even if it's just clicking on a link or visiting a page. Therefore, considering standard interpretations in CVSS scoring for similar vulnerabilities, the correct interpretation leans towards **None (N)** because the primary risk factor is the vulnerability itself being exploited through normal usage patterns by an authenticated user, not an additional step of social engineering or direct manipulation of another user.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: There's no indication that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. Hence, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**, meaning the vulnerability does not allow the attacker to affect other components or systems beyond the one directly vulnerable.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can potentially allow attackers to steal sensitive information, such as session cookies or other data accessible within the same origin. Therefore, the impact on confidentiality could be significant. The chosen value is **High (H)**, reflecting the potential for serious breaches of confidentiality.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, XSS attacks can also modify data on behalf of the user, leading to integrity issues. Given the potential for modifying user data or performing actions as the user, the chosen value is **High (H)**, indicating a substantial impact on the integrity of the system or data.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While XSS primarily affects confidentiality and integrity, it's less commonly associated with direct impacts on availability, unless the exploit specifically aims at causing a denial-of-service condition. Since the description focuses on viewing backoffice components and does not imply a denial-of-service scenario, the chosen value is **None (N)**, suggesting minimal to no impact on the availability of the system.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string is constructed as follows:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

However, considering the context of how scp operates and the fact that an attacker needs to have already obtained System privilege, which implies they have significant access, the attack vector is more aligned with exploiting a vulnerability that can be reached over the network once initial access is gained. Thus, the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**, as the vulnerability can be exploited remotely once the attacker has the necessary privileges on the system.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not mention any specific conditions or complexities that need to be met for the exploit to succeed beyond obtaining System privilege. Therefore, the complexity of the attack is considered **Low (L)**, as no specialized conditions beyond initial high-level access are required.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: It's stated that a malicious actor must have already obtained the System privilege, indicating a high level of initial access is needed. Thus, the correct choice is **High (H)**, reflecting the requirement for significant privileges before the vulnerability can be exploited.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description explicitly states that user interaction is not needed for exploitation, leading to the choice of **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability leads to local escalation of privilege within the same system and does not imply affecting resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component, the scope is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: While the primary impact mentioned is escalation of privilege, which directly relates to integrity and availability, the potential for confidentiality breach is implied through the ability to escalate privileges, potentially allowing access to sensitive information. However, the direct impact described focuses on privilege escalation rather than data exposure. Considering the nature of the vulnerability, the impact on confidentiality could be significant if the escalated privileges allow access to sensitive data, thus **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The vulnerability allows for an out-of-bounds write, which directly impacts the integrity of the system by potentially modifying data in unauthorized ways. Given the severity of such actions, especially with System-level privileges, the impact on integrity is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: An out-of-bounds write could potentially cause system crashes or make the system unstable, impacting its availability.

However, since the attack can potentially be initiated through a connected device (USB dongle) that interacts with the system over a physical interface but doesn't necessarily require direct physical access to the internal components of the system, and considering the context might imply network accessibility via Bluetooth, the most fitting choice seems to be **Network (N)**, assuming the exploit could be triggered remotely via Bluetooth connection, which is a common interpretation for such scenarios involving wireless technologies. Justification: Potential for remote exploitation via Bluetooth.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions inserting a specific type of USB dongle that isn't recognized, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. This action does not seem to require specialized conditions or configurations beyond the presence of the vulnerable code and the specific hardware, suggesting **Low (L)** complexity. Justification: The attack requires minimal setup and conditions.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability is related to the insertion of a USB device and affects the kernel, it suggests that no special privileges are needed to initiate the attack from the user's perspective, implying **None (N)**. Justification: No indication that administrative or elevated privileges are required for the exploit.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by simply inserting a USB dongle, which does not necessarily require any interaction from another user once the device is plugged in, suggesting **None (N)**. Justification: The exploit does not require the user to perform any additional actions beyond plugging in the device.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Given that this is a kernel-level issue and there's no mention of the vulnerability allowing the attacker to impact resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component, **Unchanged (U)** seems appropriate. Justification: No clear indication that the vulnerability allows for scope changes.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: While the primary impact described is a Kernel Oops (which typically relates to availability and integrity), vulnerabilities at the kernel level can often lead to unintended consequences, including potential data exposure. However, based strictly on the information given, which focuses on a crash rather than data leakage, choosing **High (H)** might overestimate the direct confidentiality impact without further details on what data could be exposed. Yet, considering the severity of kernel-level exploits, **High (H)** could be justified if assuming potential for data compromise due to the nature of kernel vulnerabilities. Justification: Potential for significant system compromise, which could indirectly affect confidentiality.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to Confidentiality, the immediate impact described doesn't directly relate to modifying data. However, a kernel-level vulnerability could potentially allow for integrity violations if exploited creatively. Given the direct mention of a crash, which doesn't inherently imply data modification, but acknowledging the potential for such vulnerabilities to be leveraged for malicious modifications, **High (H)** seems reasonable. Justification: Potential for significant system compromise, which could indirectly affect integrity.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability causes a Kernel Oops, which results in a system crash, directly impacting availability.

Given the context, it seems more aligned with **None (N)** because the vulnerability itself doesn't inherently require the attacker to have specific privileges to attempt exploitation; the critical aspect is the ability to interact with the vulnerable code path.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is necessary for the exploitation of this vulnerability. It appears to be something that could be triggered programmatically or through system interactions without direct user involvement. Hence, **None (N)** is the most suitable choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: This metric refers to whether the vulnerability can impact resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component. In this case, since it's a kernel-level issue, it could potentially affect the entire system, but the description does not clearly indicate an impact outside the scope of the vulnerable component's normal privileges. Therefore, **Unchanged (U)** seems the most fitting, assuming the vulnerability's impact is contained within the kernel's realm.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: A null dereference could potentially allow unauthorized access to sensitive data, leading to a confidentiality breach. Considering the severity and potential impact, **High (H)** is chosen, assuming successful exploitation could reveal significant amounts of sensitive information.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, if an attacker could exploit this to modify data unintentionally exposed or accessible due to the null dereference, the integrity of the system could be compromised. Thus, **High (H)** is selected, reflecting the potential for significant modification of data.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: Exploiting this vulnerability could potentially crash the system or make it unstable, thereby affecting its availability. Given the potential system-wide impact of a kernel vulnerability, **High (H)** is the most appropriate choice.\n\nBased on these selections, the CVSS v3.1 vector string is constructed as follows:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 4.300000000000001, "success": true}

Here's the analysis:\n\n- **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability is related to a memory leak in the Linux kernel, which can be exploited by an attacker who can interact with the system over a network. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated remotely.\n\n- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of exploiting this vulnerability seems to be relatively straightforward once the vulnerability is known, as it involves interacting with the `watch_queue` functionality in a way that triggers the memory leak. Thus, **Low (L)** is the most fitting choice.\n\n- **Privileges Required (PR)**: Given that the vulnerability is in the kernel and the provided information does not specify any particular privileges needed to exploit it, and considering the nature of the bug (memory leak), it might require no special privileges to trigger, especially if the interaction can be done through standard system calls or interfaces available to regular users. Hence, **None (N)** seems to be the appropriate choice.\n\n- **User Interaction (UI)**: The exploitation of this vulnerability appears to not require any specific user interaction beyond what is necessary to initiate the exploit itself (e.g., running a program that interacts with the vulnerable code). Therefore, **None (N)** is the correct choice.\n\n- **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the kernel and there's no indication that it would allow an attacker to impact resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component, **Unchanged (U)** is the most suitable option.\n\n- **Confidentiality (C)**: A memory leak could potentially expose sensitive data stored in memory. Depending on what data is leaked, this could have significant confidentiality implications. Therefore, **High (H)** is chosen, assuming the worst-case scenario where sensitive information could be exposed.\n\n- **Integrity (I)**: While the primary issue described is a memory leak, which more directly impacts confidentiality, the fact that this occurs due to improper handling of resources within the kernel could also imply potential integrity issues if an attacker could manipulate the system's state indirectly through such leaks. However, the direct impact described is more about leakage than corruption, so **Low (L)** might seem more appropriate, but considering the potential for indirect integrity impacts due to the nature of kernel vulnerabilities, **High (H)** could also be argued. Given the context, **High (H)** seems more fitting due to the potential systemic risks associated with kernel-level vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability described leads to a memory leak, which over time could consume system resources and potentially lead to a denial-of-service condition. Thus, **High (H)** is the most appropriate choice, as the availability of the system could be significantly impacted.\n\nGiven these choices, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the selected metrics.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 4.300000000000001, "success": true}

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions an \"incorrect input validation,\" which suggests that exploiting this vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or systems configurations beyond what is normally present. Thus, the complexity of the attack is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Although the exploit requires an authenticated user, it's stated that this could lead to privilege escalation, indicating that the initial privileges required for the exploit are not those of an administrator or high-privileged user but rather any authenticated user.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)** because the attack can be initiated remotely over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Given that XSS vulnerabilities often require little to no special conditions to exploit other than tricking a user into performing an action or visiting a malicious link, the complexity is generally considered low. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since this vulnerability involves embedding arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially leading to actions being taken within a trusted session, it suggests that no specific privileges are required beyond what a standard user would have. Hence, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: For an XSS attack to be successful, especially in scenarios where it leads to credential disclosure or alters functionality, some form of user interaction is typically required (e.g., clicking on a link). However, considering the description mentions altering functionality \"thus potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session,\" it implies that once the malicious script is embedded, it could act autonomously within the session context without needing further user interaction beyond the initial exploitation. But since user interaction is necessary for the initial exploitation (e.g., visiting a page with the malicious script), the chosen value is **Required (R)** might seem appropriate but given the nature of XSS and how it's described here, there's an argument for **None (N)** if considering post-exploitation actions. However, sticking strictly to the requirement for initial exploitation, **Required (R)** seems more fitting upon reevaluation.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description does not indicate that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (i.e., moving from one component to another unrelated one). Therefore, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The potential for credentials disclosure indicates a significant impact on confidentiality.

However, revisiting the User Interaction (UI) consideration with the understanding that while initial exploitation may require user interaction, the description leans towards the potential for autonomous action post-exploitation within a trusted session, which might suggest a different interpretation depending on emphasis.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading an SVG file, which implies interaction over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated from a remote location over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping,\" which suggests that the vulnerability is relatively straightforward to exploit once access is gained. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**, indicating that the attack does not require specialized conditions or systems configurations beyond what is already described.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability requires \"authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above.\" Since this indicates some level of privilege but not the highest (such as administrator), the chosen value is **Low (L)**, reflecting that while some privileges are needed, they are not at the highest level.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description states that the injected scripts will execute \"whenever a user accesses the SVG file,\" implying that user interaction (in this case, accessing the file) is required for the exploit to have its effect. However, considering the nature of stored XSS, where the primary goal is often to affect other users who were not involved in the upload process, the initial interpretation might lean towards requiring interaction. Yet, the critical aspect here is the exploitation phase, where the attacker's goal is achieved without further interaction from them, but rather from other users. Given the specifics of how CVSS defines User Interaction in relation to the attacker's actions, the correct interpretation focuses on whether the attacker needs to interact with the system beyond the initial exploit for it to succeed, which they do not. Hence, the chosen value should reflect the nature of stored XSS more accurately in the context of CVSS scoring, leading to **None (N)**, because once the malicious file is uploaded, no further action from the attacker is needed for the exploit to impact other users.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: There's no indication that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (the WordPress plugin). Therefore, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**, as there's no mention of the vulnerability allowing access or control outside the immediate application or plugin environment.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Given that arbitrary web scripts can be injected and executed, sensitive information could potentially be accessed or stolen, especially if the scripts are designed to capture user data. Thus, the potential impact on confidentiality is significant, leading to a chosen value of **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The ability to inject and execute arbitrary scripts means that data integrity can be compromised, as these scripts could modify data within the application or steal sensitive information. Therefore, the chosen value is **High (H)**, reflecting the potential for significant modification or manipulation of data.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impacts discussed relate to confidentiality and integrity, there's less direct indication of how this vulnerability would affect availability, such as causing a denial-of-service condition directly through the described exploit method. However, considering the broad potential of arbitrary script execution, it could encompass scenarios where availability is impacted, such as through resource exhaustion or deliberate service disruption scripts. Nonetheless, based strictly on the information provided, the most directly related impacts are on confidentiality and integrity. Still, acknowledging the potential for scripts to cause disruptions, a conservative approach might consider some level of availability impact. But given the focus on data-related impacts, the chosen value leans towards **None (N)**, though this might be debated based on the potential indirect effects of arbitrary script execution on system stability or responsiveness.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would be constructed as follows:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.6999999999999993, "success": true}

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The attack complexity is considered low because exploiting the vulnerability doesn't require specialized conditions or systems. It can be achieved by tricking a logged-in admin into performing an action, which is relatively straightforward. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the attack targets a logged-in admin and aims to make them add Stored XSS payloads, it implies that the attacker needs to manipulate someone with administrative privileges. However, the actual exploitation of the vulnerability itself does not require the attacker to have any privileges on the system; they exploit the lack of CSRF protection and sanitization/escaping. Therefore, considering the perspective of the attacker's initial position, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: This vulnerability requires user interaction because the attacker needs to trick a logged-in admin into performing an action (via a CSRF attack) to inject the Stored XSS payload. Hence, the chosen value is **Required (R)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Given that the vulnerability allows for Stored XSS, which affects the confidentiality and integrity of the data within the application, but there's no indication that it escapes the scope of the vulnerable component (the WordPress plugin) to affect other components or resources, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The impact on confidentiality is high because a successful Stored XSS attack can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as session cookies or other confidential data stored within the application. Therefore, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, the impact on integrity is also high since the Stored XSS payload can modify data within the application, leading to unintended changes. So, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impacts are on confidentiality and integrity, there's no direct mention of how this vulnerability would affect the availability of the system or service. However, considering the potential for significant disruption through malicious scripts, one might argue for a high impact. Yet, based strictly on the provided details focusing on XSS, the typical emphasis is on confidentiality and integrity rather than availability.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated remotely.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping,\" suggesting that the vulnerability is relatively straightforward to exploit once the attacker has the necessary privileges. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**, indicating that the attack does not require specialized conditions or systems configurations beyond the initial exploitation.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability requires \"contributor-level access and above\" to exploit, meaning the attacker needs some level of privilege but not the highest. However, since it doesn't specify high privileges like admin, the chosen value is **Low (L)**, reflecting that some privileges are needed but they are not at the highest level.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description states that the injected scripts will execute \"whenever a user accesses an injected page,\" implying that no further action from the user is required beyond accessing the page. Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**, as user interaction beyond normal browsing is not necessary for the exploit to succeed.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: There's no indication that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (the WordPress plugin). Hence, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**, as there's no mention of the vulnerability affecting other components or systems outside the immediate context of the plugin.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Given that the vulnerability involves injecting arbitrary web scripts, it could potentially lead to unauthorized data access or theft, impacting confidentiality. Considering the potential for significant exposure, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The ability to inject scripts also means the attacker can modify data or settings within the application, directly affecting its integrity. Similar to confidentiality, the potential impact here is significant, so the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impacts mentioned relate to confidentiality and integrity, there's less direct indication of how this vulnerability would affect availability (e.g., causing a denial-of-service condition). However, considering the broad potential of injected scripts, it could indirectly impact availability if the scripts are designed to overwhelm the system or cause it to crash. Despite this, based strictly on the information provided, the most conservative interpretation regarding availability might lean towards a lower impact, but given the nature of XSS attacks, the potential for disruption exists. Therefore, considering the potential for significant disruption through script injection, the chosen value could be argued as **High (H)**, acknowledging that the primary focus is on data integrity and confidentiality breaches rather than explicit availability impacts.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen values for each metric.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 3.4000000000000004, "success": true}

In versions 0.6.8 and prior, a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY AI where normal users are improperly granted permissions to export APP DSL. The feature in '/export' should only allow administrator users to export DSL. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can export the APP DSL. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.13.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a request to the '/export' endpoint, which implies that the attack can be launched over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability arises from improper permission grants, suggesting that exploiting this issue does not require specialized conditions or sophisticated techniques beyond accessing the vulnerable endpoint. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Normal users, who would not typically have administrative privileges, can exploit this vulnerability to export APP DSL, which they should not be able to do. This indicates that no special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability. Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description does not mention any requirement for user interaction beyond the initial request to export the APP DSL, which can presumably be automated.

Given the potential for exposing sensitive data, the impact on confidentiality is significant. Thus, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: While the primary concern is with confidentiality, the ability to export potentially sensitive data could also imply some level of integrity violation if the exported data is used maliciously. However, the direct impact described is more about unauthorized access than modification.

It was found from vmcore that perf had registered two ops with the same content successively, both dynamic. After unregistering the second ops, a use-after-free occurred. In ftrace_shutdown(), when the second ops is unregistered, the FTRACE_UPDATE_CALLS command is not set because there is another enabled ops with the same content. Also, both ops are dynamic and the ftrace callback function is ftrace_ops_list_func, so the FTRACE_UPDATE_TRACE_FUNC command will not be set. Eventually the value of 'command' will be 0 and ftrace_shutdown() will skip the rcu synchronization. However, ftrace may be activated. When the ops is released, another CPU may be accessing the ops. Add the missing synchronization to fix this problem.

This is because the vulnerability could potentially be triggered over a network, assuming the system is configured in such a way that allows remote access or exploitation vectors.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of exploiting this vulnerability appears to be relatively low since it involves triggering a specific sequence of events (like registering and then unregistering certain operations) that lead to a use-after-free condition. Thus, **Low (L)** is the most fitting choice.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would likely need to have privileges to interact with the ftrace subsystem and possibly other parts of the kernel. However, given the nature of the vulnerability being within the kernel itself, it's reasonable to consider that **None (N)** might be applicable if the attack can be initiated without needing elevated privileges, especially considering local exploitation scenarios where an attacker already has some level of access to the system.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: Since this vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any interaction from another user (aside from the initial setup or trigger by the attacker), **None (N)** is the correct choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The scope of this vulnerability does not change since the impact remains within the same security scope as the vulnerable component (the Linux kernel).

Therefore, the chosen value is Network (N).\n- Attack Complexity (AC): There's no indication that the attack requires special conditions or complexities beyond accessing the malicious webpage. Thus, the complexity is considered Low (L).\n- Privileges Required (PR): The description does not mention any specific privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability, suggesting that no privileges are required.

However, given the context, this might be interpreted as the user simply needing to interact with the webpage, but the description leans more towards the vulnerability being exploitable without requiring the user to perform any additional actions beyond normal browsing. Yet, considering strict interpretations, User Interaction could be seen as Required (R) because the user must at least load the webpage.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into pages that users access, which implies the attack can be initiated over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping,\" which suggests that exploiting this vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or systems to be in place beyond what is normally available. Thus, the complexity of the attack is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Although the description states that the attackers need to be authenticated with at least contributor-level access, this still means they do not have the highest level of privileges but more than none. However, since contributor-level access is not explicitly defined among the choices, and considering the context where \"None\" typically refers to no authentication required, \"Low\" seems most appropriate for requiring some form of authentication but not the highest level of access. So, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability allows attackers to inject scripts that execute when a user accesses an injected page, meaning user interaction (in this case, visiting the page) is necessary for the exploit to take effect. Therefore, the chosen value is **Required (R)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: There's no indication that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (the WordPress plugin).

The chosen value is also **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impacts mentioned relate to confidentiality and integrity, there's less direct indication of how this vulnerability would affect availability (e.g., causing a denial-of-service condition). However, considering the broad potential of arbitrary script execution, it could indirectly impact availability if the scripts were designed to overwhelm the system or cause it to crash. Yet, based strictly on the information provided, the direct impacts seem more closely related to data rather than service availability. Still, given the potential for significant disruption through script injection, one might argue for **High (H)**, but traditionally, XSS vulnerabilities are more commonly associated with confidentiality and integrity impacts. Since the description doesn't explicitly mention denial-of-service or similar availability-related effects, and focusing strictly on typical XSS implications, a conservative interpretation might lean towards **None (N)** or **Low (L)**.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions that the vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, which suggests that exploiting this vulnerability does not require special conditions or complex operations beyond crafting a malicious input. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: According to the description, the attacker needs to have at least Subscriber-level access to exploit the vulnerability.

However, since the question asks about the initial exploitation phase which requires no user interaction from the victim (other than visiting the page after it has been compromised), and considering the nature of Stored XSS where the primary concern is the injection of the script rather than its execution, there might be confusion. But given the specifics here, especially focusing on the action of the attacker, the correct interpretation in the context of CVSS scoring for the initial exploitation step is **None (N)** because the attacker doesn't need to trick a user into performing an action to inject the script; they just need to send a malicious request.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description does not indicate that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (the BuddyBoss Platform plugin and BuddyBoss Theme).

The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we analyze each metric as follows:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: Given that the attack may be launched remotely, the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**. This is because the vulnerability can be exploited over the network without the need for local access or physical proximity.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Since the manipulation of an argument (in this case, the \"path\" argument) leads to path traversal and there's no mention of specific conditions or complexities required to exploit this vulnerability beyond manipulating the argument, the best choice is **Low (L)**. This indicates that the attack does not require specialized conditions or systems configurations to succeed.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description does not specify any particular privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. Given that it affects the front-end store interface and involves file upload functionality, which typically does not require high privileges to interact with, the most fitting choice is **None (N)**. This suggests that an attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability without needing any special permissions.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is necessary for the exploitation of this vulnerability. Therefore, the correct choice is **None (N)**, implying that the attack can be automated or performed without the need for any actions from other users.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description doesn't explicitly mention the impact on other components or resources beyond the immediate vulnerable component. Thus, assuming the vulnerability does not affect resources beyond its own scope, the best option is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Path traversal vulnerabilities often allow attackers to read files they shouldn't have access to, which directly impacts confidentiality. Given the potential for accessing sensitive data through path traversal, the suitable choice is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, if an attacker can traverse paths, they might also be able to modify files or write new ones in unintended locations, affecting the system's integrity. Hence, **High (H)** is the most appropriate selection.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While path traversal primarily affects confidentiality and integrity, in some scenarios, it could lead to denial-of-service conditions or crashes if the attacker manipulates files in a way that disrupts system operation. However, based on the information provided, the direct impact seems more closely related to data access and modification rather than causing a service disruption. Still, considering the potential for significant disruption depending on what files are accessed or modified, **High (H)** could be argued, but traditionally, path traversal is less about availability. Yet, given the broad potential impacts, choosing **High (H)** aligns with considering the worst-case scenario where such an exploit could indeed significantly affect system availability indirectly.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen metrics as follows:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.7000000000000011, "success": true}

The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Despite CSRF protection preventing file uploads, the application still processes multipart boundaries, leading to resource exhaustion. By appending additional characters to the multipart boundary, an attacker can cause the server to parse each byte of the boundary, ultimately leading to service unavailability. This vulnerability is present in the `/upload_avatar`, `/upload_app`, and `/upload_logo` endpoints.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, which aligns with the definition of \"Network\" (N). The fact that it involves Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) but is initiated over the network makes \"Network\" the most appropriate choice.\n   - Chosen value: N\n   - Justification: The attack is initiated from a remote location over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The attack seems straightforward, involving the manipulation of multipart boundaries in file uploads, which does not require specialized conditions or systems configurations beyond what's typically available.\n   - Chosen value: L (Low)\n   - Justification: The complexity of the attack is low because it doesn't require specific, non-standard conditions to exploit.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability exploits a CSRF condition and leads to a DoS without mentioning the need for any authenticated session or elevated privileges, it suggests that no privileges are required.\n   - Chosen value: N (None)\n   - Justification: The attack does not necessitate any form of authentication or privilege escalation.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: Although the vulnerability leverages CSRF, which typically involves tricking a user into performing an unintended action, the primary impact described is on the server's availability due to resource exhaustion, not requiring direct user interaction with the vulnerable component in the traditional sense. However, since CSRF inherently requires some level of user interaction (even if it's just visiting a malicious site), this could be considered. But given the context focuses on the server-side impact rather than exploiting user data or actions directly, and considering the nature of the question, the emphasis might be on the lack of direct interaction needed for the DoS effect.\n   - Chosen value: N (None)\n   - Justification: The question's focus and common interpretations in similar contexts suggest emphasizing the technical exploit over the indirect user role in CSRF.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the availability of the service itself and does not imply an ability to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.\n   - Chosen value: U (Unchanged)\n   - Justification: There's no indication that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact components or resources outside the immediate scope of the vulnerable application.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The description does not mention any leakage or exposure of sensitive information; the focus is on the denial of service.\n   - Chosen value: N (None)\n   - Justification: The vulnerability does not compromise confidentiality.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, there's no mention of the vulnerability allowing modification of data; it's about making the service unavailable.\n   - Chosen value: N (None)\n   - Justification: The integrity of data is not impacted by this vulnerability.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability leads to resource exhaustion, causing the service to become unavailable, which directly impacts availability.\n   - Chosen value: H (High)\n   - Justification: The attack results in a significant impact on the availability of the service, aligning with a high severity.\n\nGiven these choices, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the selected values for each metric.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 1.0, "success": true}

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The attack complexity is low because exploiting this vulnerability doesn't require specialized conditions or sophisticated techniques beyond accessing the system and performing specific actions within the application. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability allows a user to gain access to a mailbox they shouldn't have access to simply by disabling/enabling notifications, it implies that initially, the user does not need high privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function downloadSoftware of the file /cfgFile/downloadSoftware. The manipulation of the argument filename leads to path traversal. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we analyze each metric based on the information provided:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: Given that the attack can be initiated remotely, the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**. This is because the vulnerability can be exploited over the network without the need for local access or physical proximity.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not mention any specific conditions that would make the attack complex, such as needing specific timings, configurations, or social engineering tactics beyond manipulating the filename argument. Therefore, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: There's no indication that the attacker needs any privileges to exploit the vulnerability. Thus, **None (N)** is the correct choice, suggesting that no special permissions or authentication is required to carry out the attack.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: Since the exploitation involves manipulating an argument in a function call (downloadSoftware) which doesn't inherently require user interaction beyond the initial setup or invocation by the attacker, **None (N)** is selected. The attack seems to be exploitable without requiring any actions from other users.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description mentions a path traversal vulnerability, which typically allows accessing files outside the intended directory. However, there's no explicit mention of the vulnerability allowing the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component itself. Hence, **Unchanged (U)** is chosen, assuming the impact remains within the same security scope.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Path traversal vulnerabilities often allow attackers to read sensitive data that they shouldn't have access to. Given this, **High (H)** is selected, as the potential for exposing confidential information is significant.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, if an attacker can traverse paths, they might also be able to modify files they shouldn't have access to, potentially leading to a high impact on integrity. Thus, **High (H)** is chosen.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While path traversal primarily impacts confidentiality and integrity, it might also lead to situations where system resources become unavailable due to malicious file modifications or deletions. Considering the potential, **High (H)** is selected.\n\nGiven these choices, the CVSS v3.1 vector string is constructed as follows:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 2.3000000000000007, "success": true}

The Wegia server has a vulnerability that allows excessively long HTTP GET requests to a specific URL. This issue arises from the lack of validation for the length of the fid parameter. Tests confirmed that the server processes URLs up to 8,142 characters, resulting in high resource consumption, elevated latency, timeouts, and read errors. This makes the server susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.3.0.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending an HTTP GET request to a specific URL, which implies that the attack can be launched over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The attack involves sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request, which does not require significant expertise or complex conditions to exploit. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: There's no indication that any special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability; anyone can send an HTTP request.

Hence, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the availability of the WeGIA server itself and doesn't imply access to other resources or systems, the scope remains unchanged. Therefore, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The primary impact described is related to resource consumption and denial of service rather than unauthorized data disclosure. Thus, the confidentiality impact is minimal, but since there might be some potential for information disclosure due to system instability, the conservative approach would consider **Low (L)**, however, given the context focuses on DoS, a more accurate interpretation aligns with **None (N)** because the primary goal and effect are not about stealing data.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to Confidentiality, the integrity of the system isn't directly compromised in terms of data modification. The focus is on making the system unavailable. However, considering the broad interpretation of integrity including system stability, one could argue for **Low (L)**, yet the direct impact described aligns more closely with **None (N)** because the attack's nature is to deny service rather than alter data.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability leads to high resource consumption, timeouts, and read errors, significantly impacting the server's ability to provide its services.

However, based on the provided details, the direct impact seems more aligned with availability and integrity rather than confidentiality. Yet, considering potential secondary effects, a cautious approach might consider some level of confidentiality impact, but since it's not directly stated, we'll choose **High (H)** due to the potential for information disclosure through crash analysis or similar means.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The ability to cause a system crash or potentially manipulate data through crafted packets could imply an impact on system integrity.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The exploit requires specific conditions (e.g., the size from the user bpf program being an odd number) but does not seem to involve complex operations or significant privileges beyond what's needed for the initial setup. Thus, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability involves exploiting a bug in the Linux kernel related to BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs, which typically do not require high privileges to execute. Given this context, **None (N)** is chosen, assuming the attacker needs no special privileges beyond basic user capabilities to run BPF programs.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The exploitation of this vulnerability appears to be automated through crafted inputs and does not explicitly require user interaction beyond potentially running a malicious program. Hence, **None (N)** is selected.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects components within the same privilege level and there's no indication that it allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component, **Unchanged (U)** is chosen.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Although the primary issue described is related to memory access and potential crashes, there's an implication of information disclosure due to the use-after-free nature of the bug. This could potentially allow an attacker to read sensitive data, thus **High (H)** is considered.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The vulnerability involves incorrect memory access and potential modification of data due to the alignment issue and use-after-free condition, suggesting that an attacker could modify system data. Therefore, **High (H)** is chosen.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: Given that the vulnerability can lead to crashes (as indicated by the mention of \"use-after-free read\" and alignment faults), it's reasonable to conclude that it could impact system availability. Hence, **High (H)** is selected.\n\nBased on these analyses, the CVSS v3.1 vector string is constructed as follows:\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 2.000000000000001, "success": true}

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending malicious input through the shortcode, which implies interaction over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated remotely.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping,\" suggesting that the vulnerability is relatively straightforward to exploit once the attacker has the necessary privileges. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability requires \"contributor-level access and above\" to exploit, meaning the attacker needs some level of privilege but not the highest. However, since it doesn't specify that high privileges like admin are required, and considering contributor is somewhat above basic access, the chosen value is **Low (L)**, acknowledging that some privileges are needed but not the highest level.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability allows attackers to inject scripts that execute when a user accesses the page, implying that user interaction (visiting the infected page) is required for the exploit to have its effect. Therefore, the chosen value is **Required (R)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: There's no indication that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (the WordPress plugin). Hence, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Given that the vulnerability involves injecting arbitrary web scripts, it could potentially lead to unauthorized data access or theft, impacting confidentiality. Considering the potential severity, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The ability to inject scripts means the attacker can modify the content or behavior of the website, directly affecting its integrity. Therefore, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impacts mentioned relate to confidentiality and integrity, there's less direct indication of how this vulnerability would affect availability (e.g., causing a denial-of-service condition). However, script injection could potentially be used to disrupt service, but based on the information provided, the most direct concerns are around data and system integrity rather than outright availability. Still, considering the broad potential of script injection, one might argue for **High (H)**, but more conservatively, given the focus on data and integrity impacts, **Low (L)** could also be considered if focusing strictly on the described outcomes. Given the nature of XSS attacks, though, they often don't directly aim at or result in significant availability impacts compared to their confidentiality and integrity implications.

This depends on the values read from the llc_occupancy counters. The logic is applicable to architectures where the CLOSID effectively forms part of the monitoring identifier and so do not allow complete freedom to choose an unused monitoring identifier for a given CLOSID. This support missed that some platforms may not have these counters. This causes a NULL pointer dereference when creating a new control group as the array was not allocated by dom_data_init(). As this feature isn't necessary on platforms that don't have cache occupancy monitors, add this to the check that occurs when a new control group is allocated.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability is related to the Linux kernel's handling of resource control groups, which can be exploited remotely through network interactions, given that an attacker could potentially send crafted requests to manipulate the system. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability involves a NULL pointer dereference due to missing checks for certain hardware features. Exploiting this would likely require understanding of the kernel's internals but does not necessarily involve complex conditions or configurations beyond reaching the vulnerable code path. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description implies that creating a new control group might require specific privileges, but it doesn't explicitly state that high privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability. Given the context, it seems that the vulnerability could potentially be exploited with lower privileges, especially considering the nature of the flaw. However, since the precise requirements aren't detailed, and assuming the worst-case scenario where an attacker needs no special privileges to interact with the affected component in a way that triggers the vulnerability, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is required for the exploitation of this vulnerability. An attacker could potentially exploit this issue without needing any interaction from another user. Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the Linux kernel, specifically its resource control mechanism. It does not change the scope of the attack to another component or resource beyond what's directly impacted by the vulnerability. Hence, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: While the primary impact described is related to a NULL pointer dereference, which typically suggests availability or integrity issues, vulnerabilities in kernel components can sometimes lead to information disclosure due to the kernel's privileged position. However, based on the provided description, there's no clear indication that confidentiality is directly impacted. Yet, considering potential secondary effects or assuming the worst case where such a vulnerability could lead to unintended information exposure, one might argue for a higher impact. But strictly based on the description given, the direct impact seems more aligned with availability and integrity rather than confidentiality. So, cautiously, the chosen value could be considered as **High (H)**, acknowledging that the actual impact might vary depending on how the vulnerability is exploited.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The vulnerability involves a NULL pointer dereference, which could potentially allow an attacker to modify data unintentionally or cause other integrity-related issues within the system, especially considering the kernel's role in managing resources. Therefore, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: Given the NULL pointer dereference, this vulnerability could easily lead to a crash or freeze of the system, significantly impacting its availability.

This vulnerability allows attacker to manipulate SQL queries and access sensitive database information, such as table names and sensitive data. Version 3.4.6 fixes the issue.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE, let's analyze each metric based on the provided description:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the `/html/funcionario/dependente_editarEndereco.php` endpoint, which implies that the attack can be launched over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the vulnerability is accessible remotely.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not mention any specific conditions or complexities that need to be met for the exploit to succeed beyond manipulating the `idatendido_familiares` parameter. Thus, the attack complexity is considered **Low (L)**, assuming no special conditions or configurations are required for exploitation.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability involves accessing and manipulating SQL queries directly through user input, it suggests that the attacker does not necessarily require any privileges to start the attack. Hence, the chosen value is **None (N)**, indicating that no privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction beyond the initial exploit attempt is necessary for the vulnerability to be successfully exploited. Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**, meaning no user interaction is required.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Given that the vulnerability affects the database and potentially allows access to sensitive information but does not explicitly mention impacting resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component itself, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**. This assumes the impact is contained within the application's own security scope.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability allows attackers to access sensitive database information, including table names and data. This directly impacts confidentiality, so the chosen value is **High (H)**, reflecting significant exposure of sensitive data.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: By allowing manipulation of SQL queries, the vulnerability also enables potential modification of data within the database, affecting its integrity. Thus, the chosen value is **High (H)**, indicating a high level of impact on data integrity.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impact described is on confidentiality and integrity, there's no explicit mention of the vulnerability causing denial-of-service or disrupting system availability directly. However, considering the potential for data manipulation and access, one might argue for some level of impact on availability due to potential system instability or data corruption. Yet, based strictly on the information given, which focuses more on data access and manipulation rather than service disruption, the conservative approach would lean towards **None (N)** or **Low (L)**. Given the direct implications aren't clearly stated but acknowledging the potential for significant system impact through data manipulation, a cautious interpretation could suggest **High (H)** if considering the broader implications of data integrity compromise leading to system unavailability. However, sticking closely to the described impacts, **High (H)** might overstate the case without explicit mention of availability being affected.

This suggests that an attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability over the network by manipulating socket settings. Therefore, the chosen value for AV is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated remotely over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description indicates a specific condition under which the vulnerability occurs, involving a TCP ESTABLISHED socket with `SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPF` set before establishment. However, it doesn't imply a need for specialized conditions or configurations beyond what might be commonly found in network environments. Thus, the complexity of the attack is considered **Low (L)**, as it doesn't require significant expertise or complex setup beyond standard networking capabilities.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel and relates to socket operations, which typically do not require high privileges to initiate. Given that the exploit seems to involve manipulating socket settings, which can often be done by non-root users within certain limits, the chosen value for PR is **None (N)**, assuming the attack can be performed without needing elevated privileges.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication in the description that user interaction is required for the vulnerability to be exploited. The focus is on system calls and socket manipulation, which can be automated. Therefore, the chosen value for UI is **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the Linux kernel and there's no mention of it affecting resources outside the scope of the vulnerable component itself, the chosen value for S is **Unchanged (U)**. This assumes the impact is contained within the kernel's sphere of operation.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability described is a memory leak, which could potentially expose sensitive information. Given the nature of memory leaks, they can lead to unauthorized disclosure of information. Hence, the chosen value for C is **High (H)**, considering the potential for significant confidentiality impact.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: While the primary issue is a memory leak, such vulnerabilities can also lead to instability or allow for further exploitation that impacts system integrity. However, based directly on the information provided, the primary concern is data exposure rather than modification. Still, considering the potential secondary effects of memory leaks on system stability and security, the chosen value for I is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: Memory leaks can lead to resource exhaustion over time if left unaddressed, impacting system availability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted NAS packet.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE, let's analyze each metric based on the provided description:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted NAS packet, which implies that the attack can be launched over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions a buffer overflow, which typically requires some level of expertise but does not necessarily imply high complexity in terms of the conditions required to exploit it. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**, assuming that once the vulnerability is known, exploiting it doesn't require special conditions beyond crafting the right packet.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: There's no indication that the attacker needs any specific privileges on the system to launch the attack. Given that the attack involves sending a crafted packet, it suggests that **None (N)** privileges are required, as the exploitation seems to rely on the nature of the input rather than the privileges of the attacker.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: Since the attack involves sending a crafted NAS packet, which can presumably be automated or sent without direct user interaction on the target system, the chosen value is **None (N)**. User interaction is not necessary for the exploitation of this vulnerability.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description does not indicate that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the component being attacked. Therefore, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**, as there's no mention of the attack affecting other components or systems beyond the one directly targeted.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The primary impact mentioned is a Denial of Service (DoS), which does not directly relate to confidentiality. However, considering the nature of the vulnerability (buffer overflow), it might potentially allow for information disclosure under certain circumstances, but based strictly on the description provided, the focus is on DoS. Yet, since the question asks us to consider potential impacts and given that buffer overflows can sometimes lead to information leaks, one might argue for **Low (L)** or even **High (H)** if sensitive data could be exposed due to the overflow. Given the context, though, the most straightforward interpretation from the description leans towards **None (N)** because the primary stated impact is DoS, not data leakage.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to Confidentiality, the primary impact described is DoS, which doesn't directly relate to integrity. However, buffer overflows can potentially allow for code execution or modification of data, impacting integrity. But based on the description focusing on DoS, the chosen value would lean towards **None (N)**, assuming the primary concern is availability rather than data integrity.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability explicitly allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS), which directly impacts the availability of the service.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping,\" which suggests that exploiting this vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or systems to be in place beyond what is normally available. Thus, the complexity of the attack is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by \"authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions.\" Since some level of privilege is required but not the highest (e.g., administrator), the chosen value is **Low (L)**, indicating that while no privileges might be too low, high privileges are not necessary either.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: Once the malicious script is injected into a page, it executes whenever a user accesses that page, meaning that user interaction (beyond simply accessing the compromised page) is not required for the exploit to succeed.

However, based on the description focusing more on scripting execution rather than explicitly causing service disruption, one might argue for **Low (L)** or **High (H)**.

Yet, considering typical kernel vulnerabilities often require some level of privilege to effectively exploit, **Low (L)** seems a reasonable choice, acknowledging that specifics about required privileges are not detailed.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is necessary for this vulnerability to be exploited. Thus, **None (N)** is the correct choice, as the exploitation does not seem to depend on tricking a user into performing a specific action.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Given that this vulnerability affects the kernel and there's no mention of it affecting external components or systems beyond the immediate scope of the vulnerable component, **Unchanged (U)** is the most fitting choice. This assumes the vulnerability doesn't allow an attacker to impact resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component itself.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: A NULL dereference could potentially lead to information disclosure under certain circumstances, depending on what data is accessible via the dereferenced pointer. However, without explicit details on what data could be exposed, choosing **High (H)** might overestimate the impact. Still, considering the potential for sensitive data exposure due to kernel-level vulnerabilities, **High (H)** could be justified if assuming the worst-case scenario where critical system data becomes accessible.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to confidentiality, the integrity impact could be significant if an attacker can manipulate system data through this vulnerability. Given the kernel context, even a NULL dereference could potentially lead to system instability or allow an attacker to modify critical system data, thus justifying **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: A NULL dereference can easily cause a system crash or make a service unavailable, leading to a denial-of-service condition. Considering the potential for system instability or crashes resulting from such an error, **High (H)** is an appropriate choice.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector would reflect the potential for remote exploitation with low complexity, requiring low privileges, without user interaction, unchanged scope, and high impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 3.3000000000000007, "success": true}

A known situation is the failure of a websocket handshake will trigger a local reply leading to the crash of Envoy. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.33.1, 1.32.4, 1.31.6, and 1.30.10.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The description mentions that the issue arises from a local reply sent to an external server, which implies interaction over a network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated remotely over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability can be triggered by a specific but not overly complex scenario, such as the failure of a WebSocket handshake. Given this, the complexity of the attack is considered **Low (L)**, as it doesn't require sophisticated conditions or systems to exploit.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: There's no indication that special privileges are needed to initiate the crash. Thus, the chosen value is **None (N)**, assuming that no particular access rights beyond basic network connectivity are required.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description does not imply that user interaction is necessary for the vulnerability to be exploited. The crash can occur due to system-level interactions (e.g., a failed WebSocket handshake). Hence, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since there's no mention of the vulnerability allowing the attacker to impact resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**. The vulnerability seems to affect the Envoy service itself rather than providing a means to escalate privileges or access other systems.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: While the primary effect described is a crash, which impacts availability, there's no explicit mention of data leakage or unauthorized access to sensitive information. However, considering the nature of a proxy service, a crash could potentially lead to some informational disclosure, but based on the provided details, the direct impact on confidentiality isn't clearly outlined. Given the context, a conservative approach might lean towards **None (N)**, but since the service's primary function involves handling potentially sensitive traffic, one might argue for **Low (L)** if assuming some minor potential for information exposure during the crash. For calculation purposes and sticking closely to the description, **None (N)** seems more appropriate.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to Confidentiality, the description focuses on the service crashing rather than modifying data. Thus, the chosen value is **None (N)**, as there's no clear indication that the integrity of the data is compromised through modifications.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability causes Envoy to crash, directly impacting its ability to provide services.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick an admin user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE, let's analyze each metric based on the provided description:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking an admin into clicking a link, which implies the attack can originate from anywhere over the network. Thus, the chosen value is **Network (N)** because the attacker can launch the attack from any location where they can send malicious links to potential victims.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The attack requires tricking an admin user into performing an action like clicking on a link but does not specify the need for specialized conditions or systems to be in place beyond what's typically available. Therefore, the complexity is considered **Low (L)** since social engineering tactics, while potentially sophisticated, do not inherently increase the technical complexity of exploiting the vulnerability itself.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description mentions that the attackers are unauthenticated, meaning they do not need any privileges within the system to initiate the attack. Hence, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The exploit requires an admin user to perform an action (like clicking a link) for the attack to succeed. Thus, the chosen value is **Required (R)** because successful exploitation depends on the victim taking a specific action.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: There's no indication that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the component being attacked (in this case, the WordPress instance). So, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Given that the vulnerability involves injecting arbitrary web scripts, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.9.6.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, let's analyze each metric step by step:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: Given that the vulnerability can be exploited by injecting arbitrary web scripts into pages accessible by users, and considering this can be done over the network (as it involves accessing web pages), the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**. Justification: The attack can originate from anywhere on the network, not requiring physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Since the vulnerability exploits a missing capability check and allows for script injection without needing specific conditions beyond authentication at a Subscriber level or higher, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**. Justification: The exploit doesn't require specialized conditions or configurations beyond what's already available to authenticated users.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Although the description mentions \"Subscriber-level access and above,\" indicating some level of privilege is required, it's noted that even the lowest level of authenticated access (Subscriber) is sufficient. Thus, the privileges required are considered **Low (L)**. Justification: While some authentication is needed, it's at a basic level that many users would have, making it more accessible than vulnerabilities requiring administrative or high-level access.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability allows for the injection of scripts that execute when a user accesses an injected page, implying that user interaction (visiting the page) is necessary for the exploit to take effect. However, since the question focuses on the initial exploitation which can be automated and does not necessarily require user interaction beyond normal browsing activity, it might seem like **None (N)** could apply. But considering the precise definition, where user interaction is about interacting with the malicious component, the correct interpretation leans towards **None (N)** because the exploit itself doesn't require the user to perform any action beyond normal usage. Justification: The exploit leverages the user's natural interaction with the website rather than requiring them to perform a specific action to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description does not indicate that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (the WordPress plugin). Therefore, **Unchanged (U)** is the appropriate choice. Justification: There's no mention of the vulnerability allowing access or control outside the context of the plugin or the WordPress installation itself.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The ability to inject arbitrary web scripts implies that sensitive information could potentially be accessed or stolen, especially if the scripts are designed to capture user input or session data. Thus, the impact on confidentiality is considered **High (H)**. Justification: Script injection can lead to significant breaches of user privacy and data theft.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, the injection of arbitrary scripts can modify data or behavior on the affected pages, leading to a **High (H)** impact on integrity. Justification: Malicious scripts can alter content, steal data, or perform other harmful actions, directly affecting the integrity of the system and its data.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impacts described relate to confidentiality and integrity, there's less direct indication that the availability of the system would be significantly impacted solely by the script injection described. However, considering the potential for malicious scripts to cause denial-of-service conditions or otherwise disrupt service, one might argue for **High (H)**. Yet, based strictly on the information provided focusing on data modification and script injection without explicit mention of service disruption, a conservative interpretation might lean towards a lower impact. Given the nature of the vulnerability, though, **High (H)** seems more appropriate due to the potential for scripts to cause widespread issues.

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `editar_permissoes.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `msg_c` parameter. The application fails to validate and sanitize user inputs in the `msg_c` parameter. This lack of validation permits the injection of malicious payloads, which are reflected back to the user's browser in the server's response and executed within the context of the victim's browser. This issue has been addressed in release version 3.2.6. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric based on the information provided.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: Given that the vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue where an attacker can inject malicious scripts via a parameter (`msg_c`) in a request to the server, and this malicious content is then reflected back to the user's browser, the attack vector is over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated remotely over the network without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description indicates that the application fails to validate and sanitize user inputs, allowing for the injection of malicious payloads. This suggests that exploiting the vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or systems configurations beyond what is normally present, making the attack complexity **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability involves injecting scripts into a user's browser session through a reflected XSS attack, it doesn't inherently require any privileges on the system or application itself. Thus, the chosen value is **None (N)**, indicating that no privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: For a reflected XSS attack, user interaction is typically required because the victim needs to click on a malicious link or submit a form that includes the malicious payload for the attack to be successful. However, since the question asks about the requirement for user interaction in the context of the vulnerability itself rather than the broader attack scenario, and considering the CVSS guidelines which often interpret \"Required\" as necessitating some action from the victim beyond normal browsing (like clicking a link they were tricked into clicking), the correct interpretation here leans towards **None (N)**, as the vulnerability itself does not necessitate user interaction beyond normal usage patterns once exploited.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability described affects the confidentiality and integrity of the data within the user's browser session due to the execution of malicious scripts but does not explicitly indicate an impact outside the scope of the vulnerable component (i.e., affecting other components or resources beyond the immediate application). Therefore, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**, assuming the vulnerability does not allow the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Given that a reflected XSS vulnerability can lead to the theft of sensitive information such as session cookies or other personal data by executing malicious scripts within the victim's browser, the impact on confidentiality is significant. Hence, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, since the injected scripts can modify data within the application or perform actions on behalf of the user, the impact on integrity is also significant. Therefore, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While XSS attacks primarily affect confidentiality and integrity, they might not directly cause a denial-of-service condition that would categorize the impact on availability as high. However, considering the potential for malicious scripts to cause unintended behavior or crashes, there could be some argument for impact, though traditionally, XSS is more closely associated with confidentiality and integrity impacts.

This suggests that the attack vector is local since an attacker would likely need access to the system to load and then remove the module, potentially causing the crash. However, considering the nature of the vulnerability and how it might be exploited through crafted inputs or sequences that could lead to a denial-of-service condition from a networked interface if such an interface exists for this module, it's reasonable to consider **Network (N)** as the attack vector because the impact can potentially be triggered remotely if there's a network-facing component involved, even though the primary action described is local.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Given that the vulnerability involves a specific sequence of actions (loading and removing a kernel module) which does not seem to require specialized conditions or configurations beyond what an attacker with basic system access might achieve, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: To exploit this vulnerability by loading and removing a kernel module, an attacker would typically need root or elevated privileges on the system. Therefore, **High (H)** privileges are required.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The exploitation of this vulnerability seems to involve direct system manipulation (loading/removing a kernel module), which does not inherently require user interaction beyond the initial access and privilege escalation. Thus, **None (N)** user interaction is needed.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the kernel and its modules directly, and there's no indication that it crosses security boundaries to affect other components or systems, the scope remains **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: There's no clear indication from the description that sensitive data would be exposed due to this vulnerability. It appears more related to availability and potential integrity issues rather than confidentiality breaches. Hence, **None (N)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Although the primary effect mentioned is a kernel crash, which leans towards availability, the fact that this occurs due to improper handling within the kernel could imply some level of integrity compromise, especially if an attacker could manipulate the system state before the crash. However, based strictly on the information given, the focus is more on the crash (availability) than on altering system data. So, **None (N)** might be too conservative; considering the potential for manipulating system state leading to a crash, one might argue for **Low (L)**, but given the context, **None (N)** aligns with the primary observed impact.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability causes a kernel crash upon removal of the `mtk-vcodec-dec.ko` module under certain conditions, directly impacting system availability.

Improper output encoding in the snipper viewer functionality lead to Cross-Site scripting attacks.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE, let's analyze each metric based on the provided description:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: Given that this vulnerability involves a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, which can be triggered by visiting a malicious link or webpage, the attack vector is over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not indicate any specific complexity in exploiting the vulnerability. XSS vulnerabilities typically do not require significant expertise or complex conditions to exploit, making the chosen value **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability is related to Cross-Site Scripting, which usually doesn't require any special privileges on the target system to exploit, the chosen value is **None (N)**. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability without needing any privileges.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: For an XSS attack, user interaction is often required, such as clicking on a link or visiting a malicious website. However, considering the context of the snipper viewer functionality within GitLab, if the XSS can be triggered without the user performing any additional actions beyond normal usage (e.g., simply viewing a snippet), then **None (N)** might be more appropriate. But given the nature of XSS, it's more typical to consider some level of user interaction necessary, so the chosen value could lean towards **Required (R)**. Yet, for calculation purposes and considering the potential for automated exploitation through malicious snippets, we'll proceed with **None (N)**, acknowledging this might slightly underrepresent the risk.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description does not mention anything about the vulnerability allowing the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. Thus, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**, indicating the vulnerability does not allow the attacker to affect other components or systems beyond the immediate vulnerable component.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Cross-Site Scripting attacks can potentially allow attackers to steal sensitive information, such as session cookies, thereby compromising confidentiality. Given this, the chosen value is **High (H)**, as an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, XSS attacks can also allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of the victim, modifying data and thus impacting integrity. Therefore, the chosen value is **High (H)**, reflecting the potential for significant modification of data.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While XSS attacks primarily affect confidentiality and integrity, they might not directly impact availability unless the attack is specifically designed to cause a denial-of-service condition. However, given the broad potential impacts of XSS, including the possibility of using it as part of a broader attack strategy that could include disrupting service, one might argue for **Low (L)**. Yet, traditionally, XSS is not primarily associated with direct availability impacts, so **None (N)** could also be considered.

However, since the description primarily emphasizes extraction rather than modification, but still acknowledges the appending of additional SQL queries which could lead to data alteration, the chosen value is **High (H)**, considering the potential impact.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: There's no direct mention of the vulnerability causing denial-of-service or disrupting service availability. However, SQL injection attacks can potentially lead to resource exhaustion or crashes if not properly handled, but this is not explicitly stated. Given the emphasis on data extraction, the chosen value might lean towards **None (N)**, but acknowledging the potential for indirect impact on availability through resource consumption or other secondary effects related to successful exploitation, a more conservative approach considering typical SQL injection impacts would suggest **High (H)**.

Since this can be done over the network without needing physical or local access, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of exploiting a Reflected XSS vulnerability is generally considered low because it often requires little to no special conditions beyond tricking a user into performing an action. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: For a Reflected XSS attack, the attacker does not need any privileges on the system since the exploit occurs within the context of the user's session. Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: Reflected XSS attacks require the victim to interact with the malicious link or content, so user interaction is necessary for the exploit to succeed. Hence, the chosen value is **Required (R)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: In the context of CVSS v3.1, Scope refers to whether the vulnerability can impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. For most XSS vulnerabilities, especially reflected ones, the impact is generally contained within the same security scope (the user's session on the affected website). So, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: XSS vulnerabilities can lead to the theft of sensitive data, such as session cookies, which could compromise user confidentiality. Given the potential for significant privacy violation, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: An attacker exploiting an XSS vulnerability could potentially modify data within the application, affecting its integrity by making unauthorized changes.

However, the primary concern with XSS is not typically about causing the service to become unavailable. Yet, considering the broad potential impacts, some might argue for a higher availability impact, but traditionally, XSS is seen as less impactful on availability compared to confidentiality and integrity. Therefore, a conservative approach might choose **None (N)**, but acknowledging potential indirect impacts, one could also consider **Low (L)**.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated remotely.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not mention any specific conditions or complexities that would make the attack difficult to perform. Given that it involves embedding arbitrary JavaScript code, which is a relatively straightforward technique for attackers, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability requires the attacker to be an authenticated user. This means some level of privilege is needed, but it's not the highest level since it doesn't specify administrative or high-level access. However, according to CVSS guidelines, if any privileges are required beyond none, and it's not explicitly stated as low or high, the context might suggest \"Low\" could fit, but given the choices and considering standard interpretations, **Low (L)** seems more appropriate than \"None (N)\" because authentication is required.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability allows attackers to embed arbitrary JavaScript code, which can lead to actions being taken without further interaction from other users (e.g., stealing session cookies). Thus, no additional user interaction beyond the initial exploit is necessary, making the chosen value **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the confidentiality and integrity of data within the same security scope (the IBM QRadar SIEM system itself), there's no change in scope.

However, given the nature of XSS attacks, they typically do not directly cause denial-of-service conditions unless specifically designed to do so, which is not indicated here. Yet, considering the potential for significant disruption through altered functionality, one might argue for **Low (L)** or **High (H)** depending on interpretation. Given the direct impacts are more closely related to confidentiality and integrity, and without explicit mention of availability being affected, a conservative approach might lean towards **None (N)**, but acknowledging potential indirect impacts on availability due to session hijacking or similar, **Low (L)** could also be argued.

This is because the vulnerability can be exploited over the network without needing local access or physical proximity to the system.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Since there's no mention of specific conditions or complexities required to exploit the vulnerability beyond manipulating an argument, the best choice is **Low (L)**. This suggests that the attack does not require specialized conditions or systems configurations to succeed.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description doesn't specify any particular privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability. Therefore, **None (N)** is the most fitting choice, indicating that no special privileges are required to carry out the attack.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is necessary for the exploitation of this vulnerability. Hence, **None (N)** is the correct choice, meaning the attack can occur without the victim taking any action beyond the initial setup.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability involves server-side request forgery through the manipulation of the Avatar argument in the User Avatar Handler. However, there's no explicit mention of the attack affecting resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component itself.

Considering the nature of the vulnerability, **High (H)** might seem like an appropriate choice due to potential data exposure. However, without explicit details on what data could be accessed, choosing **High** assumes significant potential impact. Given the lack of specifics, one might argue for **Low (L)** if considering minimal direct data leakage from the forgery itself, but since SSRF can often lead to more severe outcomes, **High (H)** aligns with the potential severity of such vulnerabilities when they allow access to sensitive internal services or data.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to confidentiality, the integrity impact could range depending on what actions the forged requests can perform. If these requests can modify data or settings, then **High (H)** would be justified. Without explicit details, but considering the potential for significant alteration via SSRF, **High (H)** seems reasonable.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While SSRF can potentially disrupt service availability indirectly by overwhelming the server with malicious requests or causing it to make excessive external requests, the primary impact described here relates more directly to confidentiality and integrity rather than availability. However, given the broad potential impacts of SSRF, including **High (H)** for availability might be considered if the attack could significantly degrade or deny service.

The vulnerability exists due to improper handling of the api_endpoint parameter, allowing an attacker to make direct requests to internal network services. This can lead to unauthorized access to internal servers and potentially expose sensitive information, including access to the AWS metadata endpoint.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to make direct requests to internal network services from the server. Since this can be done over the network without needing to be adjacent to or physically near the system, or requiring local access, the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not mention any specific conditions that would make the attack complex, such as needing specific times, conditions, or multiple steps beyond exploiting the SSRF vulnerability itself. Therefore, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: There's no indication that the attacker needs any privileges on the system to exploit this vulnerability. They can perform the attack without prior authentication or authorization, making it **None (N)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any interaction from another user, as it involves making requests directly to internal services through the vulnerable application. Thus, **None (N)** is the correct choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Given that the vulnerability could allow access to internal servers and potentially expose sensitive information, including access to the AWS metadata endpoint, it implies that the impact is not confined to the security scope of the vulnerable component alone. However, since the primary impact described still pertains to the vulnerable system's own resources or connected systems it can interact with, and there's no explicit mention of impacting other resources outside its immediate scope, the most conservative interpretation based on provided details might lean towards **Unchanged (U)**. But considering the potential for accessing the AWS metadata endpoint and internal servers, one could argue for **Changed (C)** if interpreting the scope change as affecting connected systems or services indirectly. For simplicity and sticking closely to the description without assuming broader impacts not explicitly stated, **Unchanged (U)** seems a reasonable default, but acknowledging this might be a point of debate.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to internal servers and potentially expose sensitive information. This indicates a significant impact on confidentiality, which aligns with **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: While the primary focus is on exposing sensitive information, there's also the potential for modifying data on internal services if they are writable and improperly secured, though this isn't explicitly mentioned. The main concern highlighted is exposure rather than modification. However, considering the broad potential impacts of SSRF, including on integrity, especially if internal services are vulnerable, **High (H)** could be argued, but strictly based on the description focusing more on exposure, **Low (L)** or **High (H)** could both be justified depending on interpretation. Given the emphasis on exposure and potential access to sensitive areas like the AWS metadata endpoint, leaning towards **High (H)** acknowledges the potential severity of impacts on data integrity in a broader sense.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The description doesn't specifically mention denial-of-service or any impact that would render the system or its services unavailable. Thus, **None (N)** seems the most fitting choice, although SSRF could potentially be used in ways that impact availability indirectly, this isn't explicitly stated.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen values for each metric.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 1.5999999999999996, "success": true}

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `tags.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `msg_e` parameter. The application fails to validate and sanitize user inputs in the `msg_e` parameter. This lack of validation permits the injection of malicious payloads, which are reflected back to the user's browser in the server's response and executed within the context of the victim's browser. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.6. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric based on the information provided.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability is described as a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts through the `msg_e` parameter, and these scripts are executed by the victim's browser after being reflected from the server. Since this attack can be initiated over the network without needing physical or local access, the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not indicate that the attack requires special conditions or complexities beyond injecting malicious scripts into the `msg_e` parameter. Therefore, the complexity of the attack is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability description does not mention the need for any specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability. It implies that anyone can inject malicious scripts into the `msg_e` parameter, suggesting that **None (N)** privileges are required.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: For a Reflected XSS attack, user interaction is typically required because the victim needs to click on a malicious link or perform some action that leads them to the page where the malicious script is injected. Thus, **Required (R)** is the correct choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description does not indicate that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. Therefore, the scope is considered **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: A successful XSS attack can potentially allow an attacker to steal sensitive information such as session cookies, which could lead to unauthorized access to the user's account. This suggests a potential **High (H)** impact on confidentiality.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, an XSS attack could allow an attacker to modify data within the application, performing actions on behalf of the victim. This indicates a **High (H)** impact on integrity.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impacts of an XSS vulnerability are on confidentiality and integrity, there's less direct indication that it would cause significant disruption to the availability of the system itself. However, considering the potential for malicious scripts to cause unintended behavior, a moderate to high impact might be argued, but traditionally, XSS is more closely associated with confidentiality and integrity issues. Given the choices and focusing strictly on the typical impacts of XSS, **None (N)** or **Low (L)** might seem appropriate, but acknowledging the potential for scripts to disrupt service, **Low (L)** seems a reasonable selection, though **None (N)** aligns more closely with traditional CVSS scoring for XSS vulnerabilities where availability impact is not the primary concern.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen values for each metric.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 2.0, "success": true}

The plugin prioritizes longer regex patterns over more specific ones when matching paths, which can lead to less restrictive CORS policies being applied to sensitive endpoints. This mismatch in regex pattern priority allows unauthorized cross-origin access to sensitive data or functionality, potentially exposing confidential information and increasing the risk of unauthorized actions by malicious actors.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability allows unauthorized cross-origin access, which implies that the attack can be launched over a network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing to be adjacent to or physically near the vulnerable system.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions an improper regex path matching issue that leads to less restrictive CORS policies being applied. This suggests that exploiting the vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or systems configurations beyond what is normally present, making the attack complexity **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability involves applying less restrictive CORS policies to sensitive endpoints due to improper regex matching, it does not explicitly require any privileges on the system to exploit. Thus, the chosen value is **None (N)**, indicating that no privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no mention of requiring user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. The exploitation seems to rely solely on the improper regex path matching mechanism, which can be triggered without user involvement. Hence, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description does not indicate that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. It talks about accessing sensitive data or functionality within the context of the affected application. Therefore, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**, as there's no indication that the vulnerability allows an attacker to affect other components or systems beyond the original vulnerable component.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability could expose confidential information due to unauthorized cross-origin access to sensitive endpoints. Given the potential for significant exposure of sensitive data, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Besides confidentiality, the vulnerability also increases the risk of unauthorized actions by malicious actors, implying potential modifications to data or system settings. This suggests a significant impact on integrity, leading to the chosen value of **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impacts mentioned are related to confidentiality and integrity, there's no explicit mention of the vulnerability affecting system availability directly (e.g., causing a denial-of-service condition). However, considering the broad potential impacts of unauthorized access and actions, one might argue for some level of availability impact.

A high privileged attacker with local access could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to BIOS upgrade denial.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we analyze each metric as follows:\n\n- Attack Vector (AV): The description mentions \"local access,\" which indicates that the attack is not initiated over a network but requires physical or direct access to the system. Therefore, the chosen value is Local (L).\n  \n- Attack Complexity (AC): The description does not specify any particular complexity in exploiting the vulnerability. Given that it involves changing the Security Version Number to an older version, which might not require significant technical expertise beyond having high privileges, the chosen value is Low (L).\n\n- Privileges Required (PR): It's stated that a \"high privileged attacker\" is required, indicating that the exploitation of the vulnerability necessitates elevated privileges. Thus, the chosen value is High (H).\n\n- User Interaction (UI): There's no mention of requiring user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. Since it can be exploited by an attacker with sufficient privileges without needing any action from other users, the chosen value is None (N).\n\n- Scope (S): The vulnerability affects the BIOS, which is part of the system's firmware, and its exploitation leads to BIOS upgrade denial. This suggests that the impact is confined within the scope of the component being attacked (the BIOS) and does not change the privilege scope. Hence, the chosen value is Unchanged (U).\n\n- Confidentiality (C): The primary impact mentioned is related to the availability of BIOS upgrades rather than the exposure of sensitive information. However, considering the potential for an attacker to downgrade the BIOS security version, there could be implications for confidentiality due to potential future vulnerabilities in older versions. Yet, based on the provided description focusing on denial of service (upgrade denial), the direct impact on confidentiality isn't clearly outlined. Given the context, the chosen value is None (N), assuming the primary concern is not data exposure but could be argued differently if more details were provided about the security implications of downgrading.\n\n- Integrity (I): By allowing an attacker to mutate the Security Version Number to an older version, the integrity of the system's security mechanisms is compromised. This directly impacts the trustworthiness of the system's security features. Therefore, the chosen value is High (H).\n\n- Availability (A): The exploitation leads to \"BIOS upgrade denial,\" which means the system or at least parts of its functionality (in this case, the ability to upgrade the BIOS) become unavailable or are denied to legitimate users.

This is because an attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing direct access to the system.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not imply any specific complexity in exploiting the vulnerability beyond what is typical for path traversal attacks. Therefore, the attack complexity is considered **Low (L)**, as it doesn't require specialized conditions or systems to exploit.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability is described without mentioning any need for authentication or privileged access to exploit, we assume that **None (N)** privileges are required.

Therefore, we consider the scope to be **Unchanged (U)**, indicating that the vulnerability does not allow an attacker to affect other components or systems beyond the original vulnerable component.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Path traversal vulnerabilities often allow attackers to read files they shouldn't have access to, which directly impacts confidentiality. Given the potential for accessing sensitive data, the impact on confidentiality is considered **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, if an attacker can traverse paths, there's potential not just for reading but also modifying files, which would impact integrity. However, the primary concern with path traversal is usually about reading sensitive information rather than modifying it. Still, considering the potential, the impact on integrity is also considered **High (H)**, as an attacker might be able to modify files outside the intended directory.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While path traversal primarily affects confidentiality and integrity, it might not directly lead to a denial-of-service condition unless the attacker uses it to delete or modify critical files, which is possible but not the primary concern here.

Not all drivers implement that callback, leading to NULL dereferences. Example of affected drivers: ptp_s390.c, ptp_vclock.c and ptp_mock.c. Instead use a dummy callback if no better was specified by the driver.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the ioctl and sysfs handlers, which are system calls and file system interactions typically accessible over the network in many configurations, especially considering the broad impact on various drivers. Thus, the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)** because the attack can be initiated from a remote location, assuming the system allows such access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Given that the vulnerability involves calling an uninitialized callback, which leads to a NULL dereference, this suggests that exploiting the vulnerability does not require special conditions or complex operations beyond accessing the vulnerable interface. Therefore, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the issue involves system calls and interactions with kernel components (ioctl and sysfs handlers), and there's no mention of requiring elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability, it seems feasible that **None (N)** privileges are required for the exploitation, especially considering the nature of the flaw which could potentially be triggered by user-space applications interacting with these interfaces.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is necessary for the exploitation of this vulnerability. The issue seems to stem from how the kernel handles certain callbacks internally, suggesting that **None (N)** user interaction is required.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects kernel components but does not explicitly indicate that it allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component itself. Hence, the scope is considered **Unchanged (U)**, as there's no clear indication of an ability to affect other components or scopes beyond what's directly impacted by the vulnerability.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: While the primary impact described is related to potential crashes or unauthorized control due to NULL dereferences, the possibility of information disclosure cannot be ruled out entirely, especially in scenarios where such vulnerabilities might be leveraged to expose sensitive data indirectly. However, based on the provided description focusing on callback handling and potential crashes, assigning **High (H)** might overestimate the direct confidentiality impact without further context. Yet, considering the potential for information leakage in certain scenarios, **Low (L)** or **High (H)** could both be argued. Given the lack of explicit mention of data exposure and focusing strictly on the described impact, one might lean towards **High (H)** due to the potential systemic impact and the fact that kernel vulnerabilities can often lead to significant security breaches, including data exposure.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The vulnerability could potentially allow for modification or manipulation of system behavior due to the lack of proper callback initialization, leading to unintended system states. This suggests a significant impact on system integrity, hence **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: Given that the vulnerability can cause NULL dereferences, it's likely that successful exploitation could lead to system crashes or freezes, significantly impacting the availability of the system. Therefore, **High (H)** is an appropriate choice.\n\nSummarizing the chosen metrics:\n- Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)\n- Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)\n- Privileges Required (PR): None (N)\n- User Interaction (UI): None (N)\n- Scope (S): Unchanged (U)\n- Confidentiality (C): High (H)\n- Integrity (I): High (H)\n- Availability (A): High (H)\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 4.300000000000001, "success": true}

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated remotely.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions manipulating API requests, which suggests that the attack might require some understanding of how the API works but does not imply a need for specialized conditions or systems to be in place beyond what is normally available. Thus, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The issue affects \"authenticated project owners,\" indicating that some level of privilege is required to exploit this vulnerability. However, since it specifies \"project owners\" rather than higher-level administrators, and considering the context of needing to manipulate API requests within their own projects, the privileges required are more aligned with **Low (L)**, as they already have some access and control over their projects.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There is no mention of requiring any additional user interaction beyond the initial authentication and manipulation of API requests by the attacker themselves. Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability allows bypassing restrictions at the group level from within a project, which implies an impact on resources outside the scope of the project owner's normal permissions but does not explicitly indicate an ability to affect other components or scopes beyond the targeted group's forking restrictions. Given the information, the most fitting choice seems to be **Unchanged (U)**, as there's no clear indication of a broader scope impact like accessing completely unrelated systems or data.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: By bypassing forking restrictions, an attacker could potentially access or create copies of codebases they shouldn't have access to, leading to a breach of confidentiality. Considering the potential for sensitive information exposure, the impact on confidentiality is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, bypassing these restrictions could allow an attacker to modify or tamper with codebases in unauthorized ways, impacting the integrity of the projects. Thus, the impact on integrity is also **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impacts seem related to confidentiality and integrity, there's less direct indication of how this vulnerability would cause a denial-of-service or significantly impair the availability of the system or its resources. However, considering the potential for unauthorized modifications, there could be indirect impacts on availability if those modifications lead to system instability or data corruption. Despite this, based strictly on the information given, the direct impact on availability isn't clearly outlined, suggesting **None (N)** might be too conservative given the potential for significant disruption through data integrity breaches. Yet, without explicit mention of causing service disruptions, choosing **Low (L)** might better reflect potential secondary effects on system stability due to unauthorized changes.\n\nGiven the above analysis, especially focusing on the direct implications of the vulnerability described, a reassessment for Availability considering typical CVSS scoring guidelines and the nature of the vulnerability might lean towards recognizing potential impacts on system or data availability due to integrity breaches.

The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.16.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE, let's analyze each metric based on the provided description:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited over the network since it involves accessing a web application endpoint (`adicionar_tipo_atendido.php`). Therefore, the chosen value is `Network (N)` because the attack can be initiated from any location, not requiring physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not indicate any specific conditions that would make the attack complex, such as needing specific timings, social engineering tactics beyond the XSS itself, or other sophisticated methods. Thus, the chosen value is `Low (L)` because exploiting this vulnerability likely requires minimal conditions beyond sending a crafted request.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability involves injecting scripts through a parameter without mentioning the need for authentication or elevated privileges to exploit, the chosen value is `None (N)`. This suggests that anyone can potentially exploit this vulnerability without needing prior authorization or special access rights.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: Although user interaction is required for the payload to execute (i.e., a user needs to access the affected page), the initial exploitation does not require direct user interaction with the malicious input. However, considering the nature of Stored XSS where the payload executes when a user views the page, some might argue for `Required (R)`. But strictly speaking, for the vulnerability to be exploited initially (the injection part), no user interaction is needed; thus, the chosen value could lean towards `None (N)` depending on interpretation. Given the context, though, the more fitting choice considering typical CVSS scoring for Stored XSS might indeed acknowledge the role of user interaction in the broader impact, but technically, the initial exploit doesn't necessitate user action, so `None (N)` aligns with the exploit phase specifically.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description does not mention the vulnerability allowing the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (e.g., moving from the web application to the underlying system or other applications). Therefore, the chosen value is `Unchanged (U)`.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: A Stored XSS vulnerability can lead to the theft of sensitive information, such as session cookies, which could allow an attacker to impersonate users, read confidential data, etc. Hence, the potential impact on confidentiality is significant, leading to the chosen value of `High (H)`.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, an attacker could use the injected scripts to modify data on behalf of the user, leading to integrity violations. This capability to alter data without authorization results in the chosen value of `High (H)`.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impacts of XSS are on confidentiality and integrity, there's less direct indication that this vulnerability would lead to a denial-of-service condition affecting availability. However, in some scenarios, malicious scripts could potentially be used to cause disruptions. Yet, based on the description focusing on script injection rather than resource exhaustion or service disruption, the chosen value leans towards `None (N)` or could be considered `Low (L)` if one interprets potential secondary effects broadly.

However, since it specifically mentions \"Privilege Abuse\" without indicating that no privileges are needed, the safest assumption based on typical interpretations would lean towards **None (N)**, considering the context implies gaining higher privileges through abuse rather than requiring them initially.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is necessary for the exploit to succeed. Thus, **None (N)** is the appropriate choice, as automated attacks or exploits initiated by attackers without user intervention are possible in command injection scenarios.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability involves executing OS commands, which could potentially impact resources beyond the immediate application or service, but there's no explicit mention of it affecting other scopes or systems directly, the conservative approach would be **Unchanged (U)**. This assumes the impact is primarily contained within the scope of the vulnerable component itself.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Given the nature of OS command injection, where an attacker could potentially read sensitive data or files, **High (H)** is chosen. This reflects the potential for significant confidentiality impact due to the ability to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, with the capability to inject and execute OS commands, an attacker could modify system files, settings, or data, leading to a **High (H)** integrity impact.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The potential to disrupt system operation or cause a denial-of-service through malicious command execution suggests a **High (H)** availability impact.\n\nSummarizing these choices:\n- AV: N\n- AC: L\n- PR: N\n- UI: N\n- S: U\n- C: H\n- I: H\n- A: H\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 1.0, "success": true}

This is because the attack can be launched from any location over the network, which aligns with the definition of a Network attack vector.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Since the exploit has been disclosed to the public and there's no mention of specific conditions or complexities required to execute the attack, the best choice is **Low (L)**.

While the description does not explicitly mention disruption of service, the potential for accessing and modifying system files could indirectly affect Availability. Considering these aspects, **High (H)** for both **C** and **I** seems justified due to the potential for significant exposure and alteration of sensitive data.

But there are too many printk() on the kmalloc() path, and kmalloc() can be called from anywhere, so changing printk() to printk_deferred() is too complicated and inelegant. Therefore, this patch chooses to specify __GFP_NOWARN to kmalloc(), so that printk() will not be called, and this deadlock problem can be avoided.

Given that this issue can potentially be triggered remotely through network interactions (considering the broad impact of kernel vulnerabilities and the potential for exploitation through crafted input), the most appropriate choice would be **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of exploiting this vulnerability seems to be relatively low because it involves triggering a specific condition (deadlock) that doesn't require significant computational power or complex sequences of actions beyond what might be achievable through standard system interactions. Thus, **Low (L)** is the best fit.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability is within the kernel and can potentially be exploited without needing elevated privileges (given the nature of the deadlock and the involvement of basic system calls), **None (N)** appears to be the correct choice.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The exploitability of this vulnerability does not seem to depend on user interaction; it's more about the system's internal operations and how they can be manipulated indirectly. Hence, **None (N)** is suitable.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The scope of this vulnerability is unchanged since it affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the same security scope as the vulnerable component itself (the Linux kernel). So, **Unchanged (U)** is the right option.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Although the primary impact described is a deadlock, which typically affects availability, the fact that this occurs within the kernel could imply potential information leaks due to the system's unstable state. However, based strictly on the provided information, the direct impact on confidentiality isn't clearly outlined, suggesting **High (H)** might overstate the case without further context. Yet, considering the severity of kernel-level issues and their potential for information disclosure, one might argue for **High (H)**, acknowledging the speculative nature of this assessment.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to confidentiality, the integrity impact isn't directly stated but could be inferred due to the potential for data corruption during the deadlock scenario. Again, **High (H)** could be considered due to the critical nature of kernel vulnerabilities affecting system stability and data handling.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability leads to a deadlock, which directly impacts the system's availability.

Therefore, the chosen value is None (N).\n\n- Scope (S): Since there's no indication that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component, the chosen value is Unchanged (U).\n\n- Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A): The path traversal vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete files on the system, which would impact confidentiality and integrity. While availability might also be affected depending on the files accessed or modified, the primary concerns based on the description are confidentiality and integrity. However, considering the potential for significant impact if sensitive data can be accessed or critical files modified, all three could be considered High (H). But typically, path traversal vulnerabilities are more directly associated with confidentiality and integrity impacts rather than availability. Yet, given the broad potential of such a vulnerability, especially if critical system files can be altered, High (H) for all seems justified.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the potential for remote exploitation without specific complexity or privilege requirements, and significant potential impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and possibly availability.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "score": 2.3000000000000007, "success": true}

Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability is related to the Linux kernel, specifically an issue with interrupt handling. Given that this can be exploited remotely through network interactions (considering the broad impact on system stability and potential for remote exploitation via crafted network packets or other vectors that could trigger the vulnerable code path), the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of exploiting this vulnerability seems relatively straightforward once the vulnerability is understood, as it involves triggering a specific condition within the kernel's interrupt handling mechanism. Thus, the attack complexity is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since this vulnerability resides in the kernel and can potentially be triggered without needing elevated privileges (especially considering the nature of interrupt handling which can be influenced by user-space actions under certain conditions), the privileges required are considered **None (N)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: Exploiting this vulnerability likely does not require direct interaction from a user, as it pertains to low-level system operations. Therefore, **None (N)** is the correct choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the kernel, which operates within the same scope as the vulnerable component. Hence, the scope is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: While the primary impact might not directly relate to confidentiality, vulnerabilities in kernel components can often lead to scenarios where sensitive information could be exposed due to the kernel's privileged position. However, based on the description provided, the direct impact on confidentiality isn't explicitly mentioned, suggesting a potential for but not a clear violation of confidentiality. Considering the potential for information disclosure in similar kernel vulnerabilities, a conservative approach might lean towards **High (H)**, acknowledging the critical nature of kernel vulnerabilities, even if the specific details here don't explicitly outline a confidentiality breach.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The vulnerability allows for improper handling of interrupts, which could lead to data corruption or modification, thus affecting the integrity of the system. Given the potential for significant disruption, **High (H)** is chosen.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: Similar to integrity, the ability to improperly handle interrupts could lead to system crashes or freezes, significantly impacting availability. Therefore, **High (H)** is selected.\n\nGiven these choices, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the potential for significant impact across multiple areas, especially considering the critical role of the kernel in system operation.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "score": 4.300000000000001, "success": true}

However, since it specifically refers to \"network-adjacent\" rather than strictly \"adjacent\" in the context of requiring a direct physical or logical connection to the device, and considering the nature of Bluetooth technology which operates over short distances but still through the air (and thus could be considered more aligned with network attacks due to its wireless nature), the most fitting choice here seems to be **Network (N)**, as it reflects the potential for attack via a network connection, albeit one that's limited in range.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability can be exploited without any specific conditions or configurations beyond the presence of the vulnerability itself, indicating **Low (L)** complexity.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: It's stated that \"Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability,\" which directly translates to **None (N)** privileges required.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no mention of needing user interaction to exploit the vulnerability, so **None (N)** is appropriate.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the system directly and there's no indication that it impacts resources beyond the scope of the vulnerable component itself, **Unchanged (U)** is the correct choice.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Given that an attacker can bypass authentication, potentially accessing sensitive information, the impact on confidentiality would be significant.

Such deadlock can happen in the following situation. When all journal buckets are fully filled by active jset with heavy write I/O load, the cache set registration (after a reboot) will load all active jsets and inserting them into the btree again (which is called journal replay). If a journaled bkey is inserted into a btree node and results btree node split, new journal request might be triggered. For example, the btree grows one more level after the node split, then the root node record in cache device super block will be upgrade by bch_journal_meta() from bch_btree_set_root(). But there is no space in journal buckets, the journal replay has to wait for new journal bucket to be reclaimed after at least one journal bucket replayed. This is one example that how the journal no-space deadlock happens. The solution to avoid the deadlock is to reserve 1 journal bucket in run time, and only permit the reserved journal bucket to be used during cache set registration procedure for things like journal replay. Then the journal space will never be fully filled, there is no chance for journal no-space deadlock to happen anymore. This patch adds a new member \"bool do_reserve\" in struct journal, it is inititalized to 0 (false) when struct journal is allocated, and set to 1 (true) by bch_journal_space_reserve() when all initialization done in run_cache_set(). In the run time when journal_reclaim() tries to allocate a new journal bucket, free_journal_buckets() is called to check whether there are enough free journal buckets to use. If there is only 1 free journal bucket and journal->do_reserve is 1 (true), the last bucket is reserved and free_journal_buckets() will return 0 to indicate no free journal bucket. Then journal_reclaim() will give up, and try next time to see whetheer there is free journal bucket to allocate. By this method, there is always 1 jouranl bucket reserved in run time. During the cache set registration, journal->do_reserve is 0 (false), so the reserved journal bucket can be used to avoid the no-space deadlock.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric: AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, and A.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability is related to the Linux kernel's bcache module, which suggests that an attacker would need to interact with the system in a way that affects its internal operations. Given that this doesn't explicitly require physical access or adjacency and considering the nature of the vulnerability, which could potentially be exploited through network interactions if there are other vulnerabilities allowing remote code execution or similar, the most fitting choice seems to be **Network (N)**. However, since the direct exploitation details aren't clearly outlined and assuming the exploit requires specific conditions met within the system itself, one might argue for **Local (L)**. Yet, considering the potential impact on system availability and integrity through possible denial-of-service scenarios via network exploitation vectors (if such exist), **Network (N)** seems a reasonable selection for a broad interpretation of potential attack vectors.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description implies that exploiting this vulnerability involves understanding specific conditions under which the journal no-space deadlock occurs, including heavy write I/O loads and cache set registrations. It does not seem to require significant computational resources or special conditions beyond those, suggesting **Low (L)** complexity in terms of the actions needed to trigger the condition once the necessary prerequisites are met.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability is described within the context of the Linux kernel's operation, specifically concerning disk caching mechanisms. Exploiting this would likely require **None (N)** privileges, as it relates to a low-level system component's behavior rather than user-level permissions.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The scenario described does not involve user interaction to trigger the vulnerability; it's about system-level operations and resource management. Thus, **None (N)** is appropriate.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability and its impact are confined to the system where the bcache is operating, without mention of affecting other resources or systems directly, **Unchanged (U)** is the correct choice.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: There's no indication that the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive information. Hence, **None (N)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: While the primary concern is availability due to potential deadlocks, the fact that data consistency and integrity might be compromised during such events (due to incomplete writes or similar issues) suggests some impact. However, given the primary nature of the issue, **None (N)** might still be considered, but acknowledging potential indirect impacts on data integrity, a case could be made for **Low (L)**.

However, because the vulnerability's exploitation doesn't necessarily involve direct network interaction but rather a local condition (booting with specific configurations and having CPU-less NUMA nodes), and considering the nature of the vulnerability which might not strictly fit the \"local\" definition in terms of requiring physical or console access for exploitation, there could be an argument for **Network (N)** if one considers the potential for remote exploitation through other vulnerabilities that allow code execution or manipulation of system states. But given the specifics here, **Local (L)** seems more fitting due to the requirement for specific system configurations and the lack of direct network exposure mentioned.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of exploiting this vulnerability appears to be **Low (L)** because it involves a relatively straightforward scenario where a system with specific hardware configurations (CPU-less NUMA nodes) and software settings (booting with CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS=y) can lead to the out-of-bounds access.

Therefore, the attack vector is Network (N), as an attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted ICMP packets over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions a data-race condition that can be exploited when the `sysctl_icmp_echo_enable_probe` is read while being concurrently modified. This suggests that exploiting the vulnerability might not require significant complexity beyond sending specific network traffic at the right moment, indicating Low (L) complexity.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since this issue is related to the kernel's networking functionality and does not explicitly mention the need for elevated privileges to exploit, we consider that no special privileges are required for the attack, thus Privileges Required is None (N).\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is necessary for the exploitation of this vulnerability. An attacker could potentially send malicious ICMP packets without needing any action from a legitimate user on the system, making User Interaction None (N).\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the kernel, but there's no mention of it allowing an attacker to impact resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component itself. Hence, the Scope is Unchanged (U), assuming the vulnerability doesn't provide a means to escalate privileges to affect other components or systems indirectly.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Although the primary impact isn't explicitly stated, vulnerabilities involving race conditions around system controls like `sysctl_icmp_echo_enable_probe` might allow for information disclosure or other confidentiality impacts if an attacker can manipulate the system's behavior based on the timing of their actions. However, without explicit mention of such, and considering the nature of the fix (adding `READ_ONCE()`), the direct impact seems more aligned with potential integrity issues rather than clear confidentiality breaches. Yet, given the lack of detailed impact analysis, one might argue for Low (L) or even High (H) if assuming potential for significant information leakage, but based on provided details, Confidentiality impact seems less directly relevant, so let's cautiously choose None (N) due to lack of explicit information on confidentiality breach potential.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Given the nature of the vulnerability involving concurrent modification and reading of a system control (`sysctl_icmp_echo_enable_probe`), there's a potential for integrity impact, as an attacker could manipulate the system's state in unintended ways.

However, based on the description focusing on extracting sensitive information, if we strictly interpret the provided details without assuming additional impacts not explicitly stated, the direct reference to appending queries could imply potential modification. Yet, since the emphasis is on extraction, a conservative interpretation might lean towards **Low (L)** or **High (H)** depending on the assumed capabilities of the appended queries.

This is because the attacker can exploit the vulnerability from any location over the network without needing local access or physical proximity to the vulnerable system.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Since the exploit has been disclosed to the public and there's no mention of specific conditions or complexities required to execute the attack, we choose **Low (L)**. This suggests that the attack does not require specialized conditions or systems configurations beyond what is typically available.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description doesn't specify any particular privileges needed to perform the attack.

Hence, we choose **None (N)**, meaning the attack can be automated or performed without the need for any user actions on the targeted system.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability allows for server-side request forgery, which implies an impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data or services but does not explicitly indicate an escalation of privileges to other scopes (like moving from a vulnerable component to affecting resources beyond its authorization). Thus, we select **Unchanged (U)**, assuming the impact remains within the scope of the vulnerable component itself.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Server-side request forgery can potentially allow an attacker to access unauthorized data by making requests that appear to come from the vulnerable server. This could lead to a significant breach of confidentiality. Therefore, we choose **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, through server-side request forgery, an attacker might be able to modify data or settings on other servers or services that trust requests from the vulnerable server.

Thus, we need to add READ_ONCE() to its reader.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, let's analyze each metric step by step:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability is related to the Linux kernel's handling of TCP settings, which can be manipulated over a network connection. Therefore, the attack vector is **Network (N)** because an attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions a data-race condition that can be exploited when reading a specific sysctl while it is being changed concurrently. This suggests that exploiting the vulnerability might not require significant additional steps beyond accessing the system, implying **Low (L)** complexity.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability involves manipulating kernel settings through sysctl, which typically requires root privileges to change but can often be read by lower-privileged users, the requirement seems to lean towards **None (N)** for the purpose of reading the setting. However, considering the context usually requires some level of access, careful consideration is needed.

If an attacker could manipulate or read sensitive information due to the race condition, then **High (H)** might be appropriate. However, without explicit mention of such capabilities, this might be considered speculative. Given the lack of detail on direct confidentiality impact, a conservative approach might suggest **Low (L)** or **None (N)**, but considering potential implications, **High (H)** could be argued if assuming the worst-case scenario of data exposure.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to confidentiality, the integrity impact could be significant if an attacker could modify system behavior or data through this vulnerability. Assuming the possibility of altering system states or data due to the concurrent modification issue, **High (H)** seems plausible.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The ability to cause a denial-of-service or disrupt system availability through this vulnerability isn't explicitly stated but could be inferred from the nature of kernel vulnerabilities, which often have the potential to cause system crashes or freezes.

Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated low-privilege operator user, meaning some privileges are required but they are not high. However, since the user is described as having \"low privilege,\" this aligns more closely with the definition of **Low (L)** than \"None (N)\" because some level of authentication and privilege is needed.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction beyond the initial authentication is necessary for the exploit.

However, given the nature of the vulnerability allowing changes to system settings, it could potentially lead to unauthorized disclosure of information if those settings include sensitive data.

Since this can be exploited by an attacker who has network access to the system (though the exploit itself doesn't require direct network interaction, the potential for exploitation over a network exists if other vulnerabilities are chained), the most fitting choice seems to be **Network (N)**. However, considering the nature of the vulnerability which primarily involves local system internals, a stronger case could be made for **Local (L)**, as the primary impact is related to local information disclosure rather than a direct network-based attack vector. Given the context, **Local (L)** might be more appropriate because the vulnerability's exploitation does not inherently require network access; it's about accessing uninitialized data locally.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability involves exploiting an uninitialized struct in the kernel, which suggests that the complexity of the attack is relatively straightforward once the vulnerability is known. Thus, **Low (L)** is the most suitable choice.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would likely need to interact with the kernel in a way that requires some level of privilege, but since the description mentions pushing data to user space, it implies that the vulnerability can be exploited without high privileges. Therefore, **None (N)** seems like the best fit, assuming the exploit can be carried out without needing elevated permissions beyond what a standard user might have for interacting with such kernel interfaces.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is required for the vulnerability to be exploited. The issue is with how the kernel handles data internally and pushes it to user space, which does not necessitate user action. Hence, **None (N)** is the correct choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the confidentiality and integrity of the system within its current scope, without changing the scope of the attack to another resource. Therefore, **Unchanged (U)** is the most appropriate selection.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability results in an information leak, meaning that sensitive information could potentially be disclosed to unauthorized parties. Given the nature of the leak (uninitialized data), the impact on confidentiality could range, but since it specifically mentions an \"information leak,\" **High (H)** might seem excessive unless the leaked data is particularly sensitive. A more conservative approach, considering typical CVSS scoring for information leaks, especially when the specifics of what is leaked aren't detailed, might lean towards **Low (L)**, acknowledging that some information is indeed leaked but without clear indication of its sensitivity or volume.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The vulnerability does not directly impact the integrity of the system, as it's about leaking information rather than modifying it. Thus, **None (N)** seems the most fitting choice.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: There's no mention of the vulnerability affecting system availability, such as causing crashes or denial-of-service conditions.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The vulnerability involves exploiting a mass assignment flaw by manipulating client-provided data, which does not require specialized conditions or systems to be in place beyond what is normally available.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions that the vulnerability can be exploited simply by the user clicking anywhere on the website, which suggests that no special conditions or sophisticated techniques are required beyond the initial permission grant. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the websites already have some level of permission granted by the user, but the vulnerability allows them to escalate these permissions without further authorization, the chosen value is **None (N)**, because the initial permissions were granted, allowing the exploit to occur without needing additional privileges.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability requires the user to click anywhere on the website, which means interaction is necessary for the exploit to succeed. Therefore, the chosen value is **Required (R)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Given that the vulnerability involves adding new permissions, this implies an impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of resources beyond the initially granted permissions. However, since the description does not explicitly mention access to or control of other components or resources outside the scope of the application itself, the chosen value could be debated. Considering the context provided, the most fitting choice seems to be **Unchanged (U)**, assuming the impact remains within the application's original scope of permissions, albeit expanded.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The ability to add new permissions could potentially allow access to sensitive information that was previously restricted, indicating a significant impact on confidentiality. Therefore, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, with the ability to add new permissions, there's potential for modifying data or settings that were meant to be protected, suggesting a high impact on integrity. Hence, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the description doesn't directly imply denial-of-service or disruption of service, the potential for malicious activities facilitated by the added permissions could indirectly affect availability. However, based strictly on the information given, the direct impact on availability isn't clearly outlined, so a conservative approach might lean towards **None (N)** or **Low (L)**. Given the potential for significant misuse, **High (H)** might also be considered if one interprets the addition of permissions as potentially leading to actions that disrupt service, but this seems less directly related compared to confidentiality and integrity impacts.\n\nConsidering the above analysis and focusing on the explicit details provided in the CVE description, the metrics might slightly vary based on interpretation, especially regarding Scope and Availability. However, a straightforward reading suggests:\n\n- **AV: N** (Network)\n- **AC: L** (Low)\n- **PR: N** (None)\n- **UI: R** (Required)\n- **S: U** (Unchanged)\n- **C: H** (High)\n- **I: H** (High)\n- **A: H** (High), considering the broad potential impact of added permissions on system and data availability through malicious actions.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "score": 0.5, "success": true}

The interface need to be released before unregistering hci device when usb disconnect. Removing BT usb dongle without properly releasing the interface may cause Kernel panic while unregister hci device.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we analyze each metric step by step:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability involves removing a BT USB dongle, which implies physical access to the device. However, considering the context of the vulnerability being related to a Bluetooth and USB interaction at the kernel level, and interpreting \"Network\" as the vector through which the attack could potentially be initiated if we consider the broader impact of Bluetooth connectivity, the most fitting choice might seem ambiguous. But since the direct action involves a physical device (USB dongle) and not necessarily exploiting the vulnerability over a network or adjacent network, the correct interpretation leans towards requiring physical access or local interaction for the exploit. Given the choices and focusing strictly on the description provided, **Local (L)** seems more appropriate because it involves direct interaction with the system (through USB), but understanding that this is a borderline case, and some might argue for **Network (N)** due to Bluetooth's nature. However, the immediate and direct action described (removing a USB dongle) suggests a need for physical proximity or direct system access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The action required to exploit the vulnerability (removing a BT USB dongle without properly releasing the interface) does not seem to require specialized conditions or sophisticated techniques beyond physical access and the specific scenario of improper removal. Thus, **Low (L)** complexity is justified.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability can be exploited by simply removing a USB device, which does not inherently require any elevated privileges on the system, **None (N)** is the appropriate choice.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The exploitation of this vulnerability does not require any interaction from another user once the initial condition (removal of the USB dongle) is met. Therefore, **None (N)** is the correct choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability and its exploitation do not change the scope of the attack to another resource beyond the immediate system or component affected. Hence, **Unchanged (U)** is the right selection.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The impact described (Kernel panic) does not directly imply a breach of confidentiality. However, considering the potential for information exposure during a system crash, one might argue for some level of impact. Yet, based strictly on the description given, the primary concern isn't leakage of sensitive data but rather system stability. So, **None (N)** could be considered, but acknowledging the potential for some data integrity issues due to the system failure, a conservative approach might lean towards **Low (L)**, recognizing the description doesn't explicitly mention data confidentiality breaches.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The Kernel panic resulting from the vulnerability could potentially lead to data corruption or loss of integrity due to the unexpected system halt. This justifies a **High (H)** impact, as the system's integrity is compromised by the potential for data loss or corruption during the crash.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability leads to a Kernel panic, which means the system becomes unavailable until it is restarted or recovered. This significant disruption to system availability warrants a **High (H)** impact.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen metrics. However, acknowledging the initial ambiguity regarding Attack Vector and considering the strict definitions and common interpretations within the context of CVSS scoring, a reassessment for clarity and adherence to standard practices is necessary. The direct action (physical removal of a USB device) suggests a local or physical vector, but the involvement of a USB device connected to a system and the potential for network or remote exploitation via Bluetooth in a broader sense introduces complexity.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into pages that users access, which implies the attack can be initiated over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping,\" which suggests that exploiting this vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or systems to be in place beyond what is normally available. Thus, the complexity of the attack is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Although the description states that attackers need \"contributor-level access and above\" to exploit the vulnerability, within the context of CVSS, requiring authentication but not high privileges aligns more closely with **Low (L)** privileges required, since contributor-level access is not typically considered high privilege in most systems, especially when compared to administrative or root access.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability involves injecting scripts that execute when a user accesses an injected page, meaning that while user interaction (visiting the page) is necessary for the exploit to have effect, it does not require the user to perform any specific action beyond accessing the compromised resource. However, because some level of user interaction is needed for the impact to occur, one might initially consider **Required (R)**. But given the nature of stored XSS, where the primary concern is the injection of malware rather than tricking a user into performing an action, and considering the CVSS guidelines which emphasize the requirement for user interaction to trigger the vulnerability, the correct interpretation leans towards **None (N)**, as the user's role is merely to access the page, not to intentionally interact with the exploit in a way that requires their conscious participation.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the WordPress instance itself and there's no mention of it affecting other resources or systems beyond the scope of the targeted application, the scope is considered **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Given that stored cross-site scripting (XSS) can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information (e.g., session cookies), the impact on confidentiality is significant. Therefore, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, XSS attacks can modify data on the website or manipulate user sessions, leading to a significant impact on integrity. Hence, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While XSS primarily affects confidentiality and integrity, it might not directly cause denial-of-service or significantly impact availability unless specifically crafted to do so. However, considering the potential for malicious scripts to cause disruptions or consume resources, one could argue for **Low (L)**. Yet, given the primary focus of XSS on data theft or manipulation rather than service disruption, and without explicit mention of such impacts, **None (N)** might seem appropriate.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not mention any specific conditions or complexities that the attacker must overcome other than sending a malicious packet. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**, indicating that the attack does not require sophisticated conditions or systems to be exploited.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: There's no indication that the attacker needs any privileges on the system to send the malicious RPC packet. Hence, the chosen value is **None (N)**, suggesting that no privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The exploitation of the vulnerability does not seem to require any interaction from a user on the target system. The attack can be performed solely by sending a malicious packet. So, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects IO devices using the library and there's no mention of the vulnerability allowing the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The primary effect described is inducing a crash, which doesn't directly imply unauthorized access to sensitive information. However, considering the potential for data corruption or exposure during a crash, one might argue for some level of impact. Given the context provided focuses more on availability (crash), the direct confidentiality impact isn't clearly outlined, but for the sake of thorough analysis, if we consider potential secondary effects, **Low (L)** could be argued, though based strictly on the description provided, **None (N)** seems more fitting because the primary impact mentioned is on availability.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to Confidentiality, the description primarily mentions a crash rather than data modification. However, out-of-bounds writes could potentially alter data, suggesting a possible integrity impact. Yet, since the main described outcome is a crash, and without explicit mention of data alteration, choosing **None (N)** aligns closely with the provided details, though one could argue for **Low (L)** considering potential implications of out-of-bounds writes.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to induce a crash in IO devices, directly impacting their availability.

However, the question asks about interaction from the attacker's perspective. Since the attacker only needs to inject the script once and does not need further interaction to achieve the exploit, the correct interpretation here leans towards **None (N)**, because the exploit itself doesn't require ongoing user interaction from the attacker.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Given that the vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data on the system where the plugin is installed, and considering the nature of stored XSS, the scope is generally **Unchanged (U)**, as the impact remains within the security scope of the vulnerable component.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as session cookies, which could compromise user confidentiality.

Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request).\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The attack can be initiated remotely over the network by manipulating content on the target site or a subdomain, allowing the attacker to bypass CSRF checks. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be launched from any location over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of the attack is considered **Low (L)** because the vulnerability exploits a straightforward weakness in how the `net/http` library is used, particularly in handling the `Referer` header for plain-text HTTP requests. This does not require significant resources or conditions beyond controlling content on the target site or its subdomain.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the attacker needs to control content on the target site or one of its subdomains but doesn't necessarily need any elevated privileges on the system itself to exploit the vulnerability, the chosen value is **None (N)**. The exploitation primarily relies on the ability to manipulate web content rather than system-level access.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The attack does not require any interaction from the victim user beyond potentially visiting a page where the attacker has control over the content. However, since the primary mechanism involves the attacker crafting requests without needing direct action from the user (other than perhaps being logged into the target site), the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Given that the vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data on the target website (`example.com`) when an attacker manipulates content on a subdomain (`attacker.example.com`), this indicates an impact across different security scopes. Thus, the chosen value is **Changed (C)**, reflecting the potential for impact beyond the initial compromised component.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability could allow an attacker to access sensitive information by issuing unauthorized requests on behalf of a user, potentially leading to data leakage. Therefore, the chosen value is **High (H)**, considering the potential for significant exposure of confidential data.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, the attacker could modify data by submitting forged requests, impacting the integrity of the data on the target system. Hence, the chosen value is **High (H)**, reflecting the potential for significant alteration of data.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary focus is on confidentiality and integrity impacts, the ability to issue unauthorized requests could also lead to denial-of-service scenarios or other availability issues, depending on the nature of the requests made. However, the description primarily highlights data-focused impacts rather than explicitly mentioning service disruption. Considering the potential indirect impact on availability through data manipulation or exhaustion of resources, the chosen value is **High (H)**, acknowledging the broad potential consequences of such an attack.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen values for each metric.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 3.9000000000000004, "success": true}

Given that this is a kernel-level issue that could potentially be exploited remotely if the system is reachable over a network (considering potential scenarios where an attacker might leverage network-accessible services or interfaces that interact with the vulnerable kernel component), the most appropriate choice seems to be **Network (N)**. This assumes that the vulnerability could be reached through network-exposed services or interfaces, even though the description does not explicitly mention network accessibility.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions a use-after-free issue, which typically requires specific conditions to exploit, such as precise timing or specific memory management patterns. However, given the nature of kernel vulnerabilities and the fact that exploitation often relies on predictable behavior within the kernel's memory management, the complexity can sometimes be considered **Low (L)** because once the vulnerability is understood, crafting an exploit may follow known patterns for similar use-after-free issues.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since this vulnerability affects the kernel, exploiting it would likely require **None (N)** privileges initially, as kernel vulnerabilities can often be exploited from an unprivileged position to gain elevated access.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description implies that no user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability; thus, **None (N)** is the correct choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Given that this is a kernel-level vulnerability, if successfully exploited, it could allow an attacker to impact resources beyond the immediate scope of the vulnerable component, potentially leading to a change in scope. However, since the primary impact is likely confined to the system running the vulnerable kernel without explicit mention of impacting other systems or scopes directly, the most conservative interpretation based on the provided details leans towards **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Kernel-level vulnerabilities, especially those involving use-after-free conditions, can potentially allow attackers to read sensitive data from memory, implying a **High (H)** impact on confidentiality.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, such vulnerabilities can allow modification of critical system data, leading to a **High (H)** impact on integrity.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: Exploitation could potentially lead to system crashes or freezes, indicating a **High (H)** impact on availability.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen values for each metric.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 2.000000000000001, "success": true}

Improper rendering of certain file types lead to cross-site scripting.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE, let's analyze each metric based on the provided description:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: Given that the vulnerability involves cross-site scripting (XSS) which can be triggered by visiting a malicious link or page, this suggests the attack can be initiated over a network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not imply any specific conditions or complexities that the attacker must overcome other than perhaps tricking a user into performing an action (though User Interaction is considered separately). Thus, the complexity of the attack itself appears to be straightforward once the vulnerability is known. The chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: There's no indication that the attacker needs any special privileges to exploit this XSS vulnerability. Typically, XSS attacks can be performed without requiring any privileges on the system being targeted. Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: While the description mentions \"improper rendering of certain file types,\" which could imply some level of interaction (e.g., a user opening or viewing those files), XSS often requires the victim to interact with the malicious content (e.g., clicking a link, submitting a form). However, since the question focuses on the technical aspect of exploiting the vulnerability rather than the social engineering aspect, and considering the nature of XSS which typically involves automatic execution upon loading the malicious content, the chosen value could lean towards **None (N)** if we consider the technical exploitation phase alone. But given the context usually involves a user needing to load the malicious page or content, **Required (R)** might seem more appropriate. Yet, sticking strictly to the definition and common CVSS scoring practices for XSS where the primary concern is the vulnerability's exploitability without requiring user actions beyond normal browsing behavior, **None (N)** aligns with typical CVSS scoring guidelines for such vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description doesn't indicate that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the component being attacked (in this case, GitLab). Therefore, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Cross-site scripting can potentially allow attackers to steal sensitive information (like session cookies) from the victim. This implies a significant impact on confidentiality. Hence, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, XSS can also allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of the victim, potentially modifying data. This suggests a high impact on integrity. The chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While XSS primarily affects confidentiality and integrity, it's less commonly associated directly with availability impacts unless the attack specifically aims at and succeeds in denying service (which is not indicated here). However, considering the broad potential impacts of successful XSS exploits, including possible defacement or disruption of service through malicious script injection, one might argue for **Low (L)** or even **High (H)** if the scripts could significantly disrupt the service. Given the lack of specifics about denial-of-service potential, but acknowledging the possibility of significant disruption through scripted actions, **High (H)** seems reasonable for a scenario where an attacker could leverage XSS for extensive malicious activity impacting the target's availability.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen values for each metric.\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "score": 3.700000000000001, "success": true}

This is because an attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities remotely without needing physical or local access to the system.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions \"with enough effort some of these could have been exploited,\" suggesting that while exploitation might not be straightforward, it doesn't necessarily require specialized conditions or systems to be in place beyond what an average attacker might have. Therefore, **Low (L)** seems more fitting than High, as it implies that the attack, although possibly requiring some skill and effort, does not necessitate unusual or highly specific circumstances.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the description does not specify any particular privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability and given the nature of browser and email client vulnerabilities often being exploitable without elevated privileges, **None (N)** is the most suitable choice. This reflects the potential for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability without first needing to gain administrative or other special privileges on the target system.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The CVE description does not explicitly mention the need for user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. Given the context of memory safety bugs in a browser and email client, where simply visiting a malicious website or opening a crafted email could potentially trigger the exploit, **None (N)** seems appropriate. This assumes that no explicit action from the user (beyond normal usage patterns) is required for the exploit to occur.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: There's no indication that exploiting this vulnerability would allow an attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component itself (e.g., escaping a sandbox). Thus, **Unchanged (U)** is the correct choice, indicating that the vulnerability does not allow the attacker to affect components or systems outside the immediate scope of the vulnerable application.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**, **Integrity (I)**, and **Availability (A)**: Given that the bugs could potentially be exploited to run arbitrary code, this implies a high risk to confidentiality (as sensitive data could be accessed or stolen), integrity (as malware or unauthorized changes could be made), and availability (as the system or application could be crashed or otherwise made unavailable).

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE, let's analyze each metric based on the provided description:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious request to the WordPress site, which implies the attack can be launched over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping,\" which suggests that exploiting this vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or systems configurations beyond what is normally present in a WordPress environment with the affected plugin. Thus, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by \"authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above.\" Since Contributor-level access is required, this means the attacker needs some level of privilege but not the highest level (like Administrator). However, according to CVSS guidelines, if any privileges are required, it's not \"None.\" Given the choices, **Low (L)** best fits because it indicates some privileges are needed but doesn't imply the highest level of access.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description states that the injected scripts will execute \"whenever a user accesses an injected page,\" implying that user interaction (in this case, visiting the page) is necessary for the exploit to have its effect.

This issue can potentially be exploited remotely if the system is accessible over a network, considering the nature of the vulnerability doesn't strictly require local access to exploit. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of exploiting this vulnerability seems relatively straightforward since it involves exploiting a memory leak condition that occurs due to improper memory handling during driver initialization. There's no indication that specific conditions or complex sequences of events need to occur for exploitation. Thus, **Low (L)** is the suitable choice.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Given that this vulnerability is in the kernel and relates to driver initialization, an attacker would likely need privileges to interact with or load drivers. However, the description suggests that the primary concern is the memory leak itself rather than requiring high privileges to exploit. Since the vulnerability could potentially be triggered through user-space interactions that lead to driver loading or initialization, **None (N)** might seem plausible at first glance. Yet, considering typical scenarios where such vulnerabilities are exploitable, some level of privilege might be necessary for practical exploitation, but based strictly on the information provided, **None (N)** aligns with the assumption of least privilege required for the initial condition leading to the leak.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability description implies that user interaction is not directly required for the memory leak to occur; it's more about the improper handling of resources during driver initialization. Hence, **None (N)** is the correct choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system within its original scope, which is the Linux kernel. It does not change the scope to another resource or component beyond what's impacted by the kernel's operation. Therefore, **Unchanged (U)** is the right selection.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: A memory leak can potentially expose sensitive data, thus impacting confidentiality. Given the nature of kernel-level vulnerabilities, the impact on confidentiality could be significant. Therefore, **High (H)** is chosen.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, a memory leak could allow an attacker to modify sensitive data, affecting the system's integrity. Considering the potential for exploitation, **High (H)** is selected.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service condition or crash, especially if the memory leak is exploited to cause system instability.

Thus, the chosen value is **Network (N)** because the vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Given that XSS attacks often rely on injecting malicious code into websites, which can be relatively straightforward for attackers to accomplish once a vulnerability is identified, the complexity of the attack is considered **Low (L)**. This is because the attack does not require specialized conditions or extensive resources beyond exploiting the existing vulnerability.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the description mentions that certain error messages could allow XSS attacks, it implies that no specific privileges are needed to trigger these error messages. Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**, indicating that the attack can be performed without requiring any special privileges.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: For XSS attacks, user interaction is typically required to execute the malicious script (e.g., clicking on a link or submitting a form). However, considering the context might imply automated exploitation through error messages, but generally, XSS requires a user to interact with the malicious content. Yet, given the nature of XSS, it's more aligned with **None (N)** in many scoring contexts because the interaction is often passive (e.g., simply visiting a page), but strictly speaking, some level of interaction (like loading a webpage) is necessary. For CVSS purposes and clarity in this explanation, acknowledging the typical requirement for some form of user action (even if minimal), one might argue for **Required (R)**, but the common interpretation in CVSS scoring for XSS tends towards **None (N)** due to its potential for exploitation without direct user intent.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description does not indicate that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. Therefore, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**, as there's no clear indication that the attack can compromise other components or systems beyond the original vulnerable component.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: XSS attacks can lead to the theft of sensitive information, such as session cookies or other personal data. Given this potential, the impact on confidentiality is significant. Thus, the chosen value is **High (H)**, reflecting the potential for substantial leakage of confidential information.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, XSS attacks can modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user, impacting the integrity of the system or data. Therefore, the chosen value is **High (H)**, as the attack can result in significant modifications or manipulations of data.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While XSS attacks primarily affect confidentiality and integrity, they might not directly impact availability unless the attack is specifically designed to cause a denial-of-service condition. However, the primary concern with XSS is not typically about making the system unavailable but rather about stealing or modifying data.

Thus, the complexity of the attack is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability involves injecting commands through a parameter without specifying the need for elevated privileges, it's reasonable to assume that **None (N)** privileges are required for the exploitation. This means an attacker does not need any special access rights to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There is no indication that user interaction is necessary for the exploitation of this vulnerability. An attacker can presumably inject commands without needing another user to perform any actions.

A vulnerability has been identified in the ORC C++ LZO decompression logic, where specially crafted malformed ORC files can cause the decompressor to allocate a 250-byte buffer but then attempts to copy 295 bytes into it. It causes memory corruption. This issue affects Apache ORC C++ library: through 1.8.8, from 1.9.0 through 1.9.5, from 2.0.0 through 2.0.4, from 2.1.0 through 2.1.1. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.8.9, 1.9.6, 2.0.5, and 2.1.2, which fix the issue.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted malformed ORC files, which can be sent over a network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The attack requires crafting specific malformed files to exploit the heap-based buffer overflow, but it doesn't require special conditions or configurations beyond that. Thus, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**, as the attack can be performed with minimal expertise once the vulnerability is known.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: There's no indication that high privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability; an attacker could potentially send a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability without needing elevated permissions. Hence, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: To exploit this vulnerability, user interaction is not required; simply processing the malicious ORC file is enough to trigger the vulnerability. So, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since there's no mention of the vulnerability allowing the attacker to impact resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component, the scope is considered **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Given that this is a heap-based buffer overflow, it could potentially allow an attacker to read sensitive data from the memory, thus impacting confidentiality.

This lingering reference comes from a secpath (which holds a ref on the xfrm_state), which is still attached to an skb. This skb is not leaked, it ends up on sk_receive_queue and then gets defer-free'd by skb_attempt_defer_free. The problem happens when we defer freeing an skb (push it on one CPU's defer_list), and don't flush that list before the netns is deleted. In that case, we still have a reference on the xfrm_state that we don't expect at this point. We already drop the skb's dst in the TCP receive path when it's no longer needed, so let's also drop the secpath. At this point, tcp_filter has already called into the LSM hooks that may require the secpath, so it should not be needed anymore. However, in some of those places, the MPTCP extension has just been attached to the skb, so we cannot simply drop all extensions.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric: AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, and A.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability is related to the Linux kernel's handling of network packets, specifically TCP connections and security paths. Since this involves network communication, the most appropriate attack vector is **Network (N)**. Justification: The vulnerability can be exploited over the network, as it involves the processing of TCP packets.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description suggests that exploiting this vulnerability requires specific conditions, such as creating a pair of network namespaces, running a TCP test over ipcomp6, and then deleting these namespaces. However, it does not imply a need for specialized conditions or systems beyond what could be reasonably expected in a network environment. Thus, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**. Justification: While specific steps are required, they do not seem to necessitate unusual or highly complex actions.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description does not explicitly mention the need for elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability. Given that it involves network operations that can potentially be performed by non-privileged users (e.g., establishing TCP connections), it seems that **None (N)** privileges are required. Justification: There's no indication that root or other high-level privileges are necessary to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The exploitation scenario described involves automated tests and system-level operations, suggesting that **No (N)** user interaction is required. Justification: The vulnerability can be triggered through programmatic or scripted means without needing direct user intervention.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability appears to be confined within the scope of the vulnerable component (the Linux kernel) and does not imply an ability to impact resources beyond its normal privilege boundaries. Therefore, the scope is **Unchanged (U)**. Justification: There's no indication that the vulnerability allows an attacker to affect components or data outside the kernel's normal sphere of influence.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The description focuses on the improper handling of security paths and references but does not directly imply a leak of sensitive information. However, vulnerabilities in security mechanisms can often lead to confidentiality impacts. Considering the potential for information disclosure due to mishandling of security contexts, the impact on confidentiality could be considered **High (H)**. Justification: Although not explicitly stated, vulnerabilities in security path handling might facilitate unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to confidentiality, the integrity impact could be significant if an attacker can manipulate or alter data due to the vulnerability. Given the nature of the issue, which involves the kernel's handling of network security, the impact on integrity could also be **High (H)**. Justification: Manipulation of security paths could potentially allow alteration of data or system settings.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability's primary impact seems related to the potential for crashing or destabilizing the system due to incorrect reference counting and object lifetime management. This could lead to a denial-of-service condition, implying a **High (H)** impact on availability.

Given that this can be exploited over a network (considering the nature of cryptographic operations which can be initiated remotely), the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**. Justification: The attack can be initiated from a remote location, targeting the system over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions a specific condition (integer underflow due to a larger source buffer than the key size) that needs to be met for the vulnerability to be exploitable. However, it does not imply a need for specialized conditions or multiple vulnerabilities to be exploited in sequence. Thus, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**. Justification: The exploitability of the vulnerability does not require sophisticated conditions beyond the initial vulnerability itself.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: There's no indication that the exploitation requires any specific privileges on the system. Therefore, **None (N)** is the most fitting choice. Justification: The description suggests that the vulnerability could potentially be exploited without needing elevated or special privileges.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: Since the vulnerability involves handling requests at a system level (crypto operations), it doesn't necessitate user interaction to be exploited. Hence, **None (N)** is selected. Justification: Exploitation can occur without the need for an individual to interact with the system in a specific way.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Given that the vulnerability affects the crypto module within the Linux kernel and there's no mention of it impacting resources beyond its own scope, **Unchanged (U)** is chosen. Justification: The impact appears contained within the component where the vulnerability resides.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: An integer underflow potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation of sensitive data implies a risk to confidentiality. Considering the potential severity, **High (H)** seems appropriate. Justification: Cryptographic operations involve sensitive data; compromising these could lead to significant confidentiality breaches.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, if an attacker can manipulate data due to the vulnerability, the integrity of the system or data could be compromised. Thus, **High (H)** is selected. Justification: Manipulation of cryptographic data or processes could lead to significant integrity violations.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary risks seem to revolve around confidentiality and integrity, the potential disruption caused by exploiting such a vulnerability (especially in critical systems relying heavily on cryptographic operations) could also affect availability.

Thus, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability involves submitting malformed payloads during secret creation or update operations, which presumably can be performed by authenticated users but does not necessarily imply administrative or high privileges, the chosen value could initially seem ambiguous. However, considering the context typically requires some form of authentication or access to perform such actions, and given the lack of explicit mention of high or no privileges required, one might lean towards **None (N)** if assuming the lowest bar for exploitation, especially since the focus is on the data exposure aspect rather than privilege escalation.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability is triggered by submitting malformed payloads, which directly implies an action taken by a user or an entity mimicking user behavior. However, this interaction is more about exploiting the system's handling of malformed input rather than requiring a specific user to perform an action after the initial exploit (like clicking on something).

Thus, the chosen value is Low (L).\n- Privileges Required (PR): The description does not specify any particular privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability, implying that no special access is required. Therefore, the chosen value is None (N).\n- User Interaction (UI): Since the vulnerability involves the manipulation of an argument in an API call, which can presumably be done programmatically without user intervention, the chosen value is None (N).\n- Scope (S): The description doesn't indicate that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. Hence, the chosen value is Unchanged (U).\n- Confidentiality (C): The vulnerability leads to a denial of service, which typically impacts availability rather than directly compromising confidentiality. However, since there's no explicit mention of data exposure, but considering the nature of the attack (denial of service), we might lean towards None (N) for confidentiality impact.\n- Integrity (I): Similar to confidentiality, integrity is about modifying data. The description focuses on denial of service rather than data modification, suggesting that the primary impact is not on data integrity. Thus, the chosen value could be None (N), but given the context, if we consider potential side effects or assume some form of data integrity could be compromised indirectly due to the service disruption, one might argue for Low (L). However, based strictly on the information provided, None (N) seems more appropriate.\n- Availability (A): The vulnerability leads to a denial of service, which directly impacts the availability of the system or service.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE, let's analyze each metric based on the provided description:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into pages that users access, which implies the attack can be initiated over the network. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions \"insufficient input sanitization and output escaping,\" which suggests that exploiting this vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or systems to be in place beyond what is normally available. Thus, the complexity is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by \"authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above.\" Since contributor-level access is required, this means the privileges needed are not those of an average user but are also not the highest level of privileges. However, given the options, **Low (L)** best fits because it indicates some level of privilege is required but not the highest.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description states that the injected scripts \"will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page,\" implying that user interaction (in this case, accessing the page) is necessary for the exploit to have its effect. Therefore, the chosen value is **Required (R)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: There's no indication that the vulnerability allows the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component (the WordPress plugin). Hence, the scope is considered **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Given that the vulnerability involves stored cross-site scripting, it could potentially allow attackers to steal sensitive information from users who interact with the compromised page. This suggests a significant impact on confidentiality, so the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, since the vulnerability allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts, it could enable attackers to modify data on the site or perform actions on behalf of other users, indicating a high impact on integrity. Thus, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While the primary impacts described relate to confidentiality and integrity, there's potential for the injected scripts to cause disruptions or denial-of-service conditions, affecting availability. However, the description primarily focuses on script injection rather than explicitly mentioning disruption of service, so the impact on availability might be considered less direct compared to confidentiality and integrity. Still, considering the potential, **High (H)** could be argued, but typically, XSS vulnerabilities are more directly associated with confidentiality and integrity impacts.

In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it is possible for any authenticated user, through the use of the filemanager to delete any file owned by the user running the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) on the host without any limitation on the filesystem's scope. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to arbitrarily remove content from the Wiki resulting in partial loss of data and defacement/deterioration of the website. In the context of a container installation of YesWiki without any modification, the `yeswiki` files (for example .php) are not owned by the same user (root) as the one running the FPM process (www-data). However in a standard installation, www-data may also be the owner of the PHP files, allowing a malicious user to completely cut the access to the wiki by deleting all important PHP files (like index.php or core files of YesWiki). Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for this issue.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated user through the file manager, which implies that the attack can be launched over the network.

Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**, indicating no additional user interaction is needed after authentication.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component (the authenticated user can affect files not owned by them), which suggests a change in scope. Hence, the chosen value is **Changed (C)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: While the primary impact described is the deletion of files leading to loss of data and potential defacement, there isn't a direct mention of sensitive information disclosure. However, considering the potential for significant data loss, the chosen value could lean towards **High (H)** due to the potential for significant impact on the availability and integrity of the data, even though confidentiality itself might not be directly compromised in terms of data exposure.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The vulnerability allows for arbitrary file deletion, which directly impacts the integrity of the system and its data. Given the severity of this impact, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: By allowing the deletion of critical files such as index.php or core files, the vulnerability can completely deny access to the wiki, significantly impacting its availability.

Since this can potentially happen over the network if the logs are accessible remotely or through other means that don't require physical or local access, the most appropriate choice seems to be **Network (N)**. However, considering the context more closely, the primary concern here involves an app accessing logs locally on the device, suggesting **Local (L)** might be more accurate because the attack doesn't explicitly require network access but rather access to the local system logs.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Given that an app may simply be able to view the information without needing to bypass significant security controls or complexities, the complexity is likely **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description does not specify that high privileges are needed for an app to view the logs; thus, it seems that **None (N)** or **Low (L)** could apply. Considering typical scenarios where apps might access system logs, **None (N)** seems plausible because the issue focuses on what an app can do without specifying elevated privileges.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is required for the vulnerability to be exploited; hence, **None (N)** is the best fit.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the confidentiality of data within the same security scope (the system logs), **Unchanged (U)** is appropriate.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability involves viewing a contact's phone number, which is sensitive information.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing local access to the system.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not indicate any specific conditions that would make the attack complex, such as requiring specialized conditions or multiple steps beyond typical XSS exploitation. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**, reflecting that the attack can be performed with minimal effort once the vulnerability is identified.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since this is a Stored XSS vulnerability, it implies that an attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the website, which would then be executed by other users' browsers. However, the description doesn't specify that high privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability initially. Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**, assuming the attacker does not need any special privileges to input the malicious script.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: For Stored XSS, user interaction is typically required for the exploit to be effective (i.e., a user needs to visit the compromised page). However, considering the nature of Stored XSS where the payload is stored on the server and executed without direct user action beyond visiting the page, some might argue it's **None (N)** because the user doesn't have to perform any specific action beyond normal browsing. But given the strict definitions, since a user must interact with the affected page for the XSS to execute, the more fitting choice here, aligning with common CVSS scoring practices for Stored XSS, is actually **None (N)**, because the interaction is merely standard usage of the web application, not an explicit action to trigger the exploit.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability description does not mention anything about the vulnerability allowing the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. Therefore, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**, indicating that the attack does not allow the attacker to affect other components or systems beyond the immediate vulnerable application.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Stored XSS can lead to the theft of sensitive information, such as session cookies, which could compromise user confidentiality. Hence, the chosen value is **High (H)**, as an attacker could potentially steal sensitive data.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similarly, Stored XSS can also allow attackers to modify data on behalf of the user, affecting the integrity of the system or user data. So, the chosen value is **High (H)**, reflecting the potential for significant modification of data.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: While XSS attacks primarily target confidentiality and integrity, they might not directly aim at disrupting service availability. However, depending on the nature of the injected script, it could potentially cause denial-of-service conditions or other disruptions. Yet, given the primary focus of XSS on data theft or manipulation rather than service disruption, the chosen value here leans towards **None (N)**, but acknowledging that in practice, the impact could vary.

Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing physical or local access.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions that the vulnerability is due to improper validation and sanitization of user input, suggesting that exploiting this vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or systems configurations beyond what is normally present. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**, indicating that the attack is relatively simple to carry out.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious content that executes when viewed by an admin, but it does not specify that the attacker needs any privileges to inject this content. Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**, as the attacker does not need any special privileges to perform the initial step of the attack.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The exploitation of the vulnerability requires an admin to view the injected malicious SVG content for the arbitrary JavaScript code to execute. This means that some level of interaction (in this case, viewing) is required from another user (the admin) after the initial injection by the attacker. However, since the question focuses on the action of the attacker and the nature of the vulnerability itself rather than the subsequent actions needed for full impact, and considering the attacker's direct action does not require interaction, there might be confusion. Given the specifics of CVSS scoring, if the vulnerability's exploitation directly depends on a user's action (beyond the attacker's control), it would typically be considered as requiring interaction. But here, focusing strictly on the attacker's capability to initiate the exploit without needing further interaction from them, the chosen value could lean towards **None (N)**, acknowledging the nuance that the exploit's success does depend on an admin viewing the content, but this is about the attack's initiation.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The description does not mention anything about the vulnerability allowing the attacker to impact resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component. Therefore, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**, indicating that the vulnerability does not allow the attacker to affect other components or systems beyond the one being attacked.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability could lead to credential theft, which directly impacts confidentiality. Given the potential for significant disclosure of sensitive information (like credentials), the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: While the primary concern mentioned is credential theft (which affects confidentiality), the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code could also potentially modify data or settings within the application, impacting integrity. However, the description primarily highlights confidentiality concerns. Considering the potential for modifying data through arbitrary code execution, the chosen value could be **High (H)**, reflecting the potential impact on system integrity.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: There's no explicit mention of how the vulnerability could be used to disrupt service or make resources unavailable. The focus is on executing arbitrary code for credential theft, not on causing a denial-of-service or disrupting the system's availability.

Given that this issue can be triggered through network interactions (as RPC implies remote procedure calls which can be initiated over a network), the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description indicates a specific condition under which the vulnerability occurs (null-ptr-deref when xps sysfs alloc failed), suggesting that exploiting this might not require significant complexity beyond reaching the vulnerable code path. Thus, **Low (L)** is chosen.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability seems to be exploitable without requiring elevated privileges since it involves a low-level system component (kernel) that can potentially be interacted with by various processes. Therefore, **None (N)** is selected.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The exploitability of this vulnerability does not seem to depend on user interaction, as it relates to system internals and RPC operations. Hence, **None (N)** is the correct choice.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects components within the same privilege level (i.e., within the kernel or its modules), and there's no indication that it allows an attacker to impact resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component, **Unchanged (U)** is chosen.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Although the primary impact described is a null pointer dereference, which typically suggests a crash or potential code execution, the direct confidentiality impact isn't explicitly stated. However, considering the nature of such vulnerabilities, they could potentially lead to information disclosure if exploited correctly. Given the lack of explicit detail on confidentiality impact but acknowledging potential, **High (H)** might be considered in scenarios where sensitive data could be exposed due to the vulnerability's nature, but without clear evidence, **Low (L)** or **None (N)** could also be argued. For calculation purposes and considering potential impacts, let's choose **High (H)**, assuming the worst-case scenario where an attacker could leverage this for information disclosure.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to Confidentiality, the Integrity impact could be significant if an attacker could modify system states or data through exploitation. Given the kernel-level nature of the vulnerability, **High (H)** is a reasonable choice, assuming an attacker could potentially alter system integrity.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability description mentions a null pointer dereference, which often leads to crashes or denial-of-service conditions.

Therefore, the most appropriate choice is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions avoiding a NULL pointer dereference, which implies that exploiting this vulnerability might not require significant complexity once the vulnerability is known. Thus, the best choice is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability is in the kernel, exploiting it likely requires low-level system access. However, the description does not explicitly mention the need for high privileges to exploit the vulnerability. Given the context, **None (N)** seems the most fitting because the vulnerability's exploitation doesn't inherently require user privileges; it's more about accessing the vulnerable code path.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There's no indication that user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

Therefore, **Unchanged (U)** is the most suitable option.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: A NULL pointer dereference could potentially lead to information disclosure under certain circumstances, although the primary concern here appears to be more about crashing the system or executing arbitrary code rather than leaking sensitive data directly. Considering potential impacts, **High (H)** might seem excessive without direct evidence of data leakage, but given the nature of kernel vulnerabilities, the potential for confidentiality impact cannot be entirely ruled out. However, typically, such vulnerabilities are more about crashing or executing code, so **Low (L)** or **High (H)** could both be argued. Without explicit details on information disclosure, choosing **High (H)** leans towards considering the worst-case scenario where an attacker could leverage this for sensitive data exposure.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to Confidentiality, the integrity impact could be significant if an attacker can manipulate the system state through this vulnerability, potentially leading to **High (H)** integrity loss by modifying system files or data.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: A NULL pointer dereference can cause a system crash, which directly impacts availability.

While reading icmp sysctl variables, they can be changed concurrently. So, we need to add READ_ONCE() to avoid data-races.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, let's analyze each metric step by step:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability is related to the Linux kernel and involves accessing icmp sysctl variables. This suggests that an attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability over the network by sending crafted ICMP packets. Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**, as the attack can be initiated from a remote location over the network.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions fixing data-races around sysctl variables, which implies that exploiting this vulnerability might not require significant computational power or complex operations beyond what is typically needed for network attacks. Thus, the complexity of the attack is considered **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: There's no indication that high privileges are required to read icmp sysctl variables or to initiate the conditions under which the data-race occurs. Hence, **None (N)** is chosen, assuming an attacker does not need special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability seems to be exploitable without requiring any interaction from a user on the targeted system. It appears to be something that could be triggered remotely through network interactions alone. Therefore, **None (N)** is selected.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability affects the Linux kernel and there's no mention of it affecting other scopes or components beyond its immediate environment, **Unchanged (U)** is chosen. This indicates that the vulnerability does not allow an attacker to impact resources beyond the privileges of the vulnerable component.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Although the primary issue described is related to data-races and potential integrity issues due to concurrent changes, if an attacker could manipulate these variables, it might indirectly lead to confidentiality impacts, such as revealing sensitive information about the system's configuration or state. However, based strictly on the description provided, the direct impact seems more aligned with integrity rather than confidentiality. Given the nature of sysctl variables and their role in system configuration, if an attacker could alter them, it might lead to **High (H)** confidentiality impacts, but considering the context, this might be a stretch without further details. Thus, choosing **High (H)** here assumes potential severe consequences from manipulating system configurations, acknowledging this might slightly overestimate based on provided details.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: The ability to change sysctl variables concurrently while they are being read directly impacts the integrity of the system's configuration. An attacker could potentially exploit this to make unauthorized changes, leading to **High (H)** integrity impacts.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: If an attacker could successfully exploit this vulnerability to alter critical system settings, it might lead to system instability or crashes, thereby affecting availability.

A SQL Injection vulnerability was identified in versions prior to 3.4.6 in the endpoint `/html/atendido/Profile_Atendido.php`, in the `idatendido` parameter. This vulnerability allow an authorized attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing access to sensitive information. Version 3.4.6 fixes the issue.\n", "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description, we need to determine the values for each base metric.\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the network since it involves accessing a web endpoint (`/html/atendido/Profile_Atendido.php`). Therefore, the chosen value is **Network (N)**.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not mention any specific conditions that would make the attack complex, such as needing specific timings or multiple steps beyond sending a crafted request. Thus, the chosen value is **Low (L)**.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Although the description mentions an \"authorized attacker,\" the fact that the vulnerability allows access to sensitive information via SQL injection suggests that the initial privileges required to exploit this vulnerability might not be high, but some level of authorization is needed to interact with the system. However, given the context, it seems the emphasis is on the vulnerability being exploitable once an attacker has access, implying **None (N)** might not fully capture the nuance. Yet, based strictly on the information provided and typical interpretations, if an attacker needs to be \"authorized\" to reach the point of exploitation, this could imply **Low (L)** privileges are required for the initial access, but since the question doesn't explicitly detail the authorization level needed to exploit the SQL injection itself, there's a case for **None (N)** if considering the exploit's requirements post-initial access. Given the ambiguity and focusing on the exploit itself, **None (N)** could be argued, but considering standard CVSS scoring practices and the need for some form of access, **Low (L)** seems more appropriate based on the description provided.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any interaction from another user besides the attacker. Therefore, the chosen value is **None (N)**.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: Since the vulnerability allows access to sensitive information through SQL queries, which implies impact within the same security scope as the vulnerable component, the chosen value is **Unchanged (U)**.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability allows access to sensitive information, which directly impacts confidentiality. Given the potential for significant data exposure, the chosen value is **High (H)**.\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: While the primary impact mentioned is on confidentiality, SQL injection vulnerabilities often also allow for modifying data, thus potentially affecting integrity. However, the description focuses on accessing sensitive information, not altering it. Still, considering the nature of SQL injection, there's a potential for integrity impact, so the chosen value could lean towards **High (H)**, assuming the capability to modify is inherent in the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries.\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: There's no direct indication that the vulnerability would lead to a denial-of-service condition or directly impact availability. Thus, the chosen value is **None (N)**, although in practice, exploiting such a vulnerability could potentially lead to conditions affecting availability indirectly.\n\nGiven these considerations, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would reflect the chosen values for each metric. However, revisiting the Privileges Required (PR) with a strict interpretation of the provided details and common CVSS scoring guidelines, if the system requires an attacker to be \"authorized\" to exploit, yet the exploit itself doesn't necessitate high privileges once accessed, the scoring might align more closely with the initial interpretation of **Low (L)** for PR, considering the need for some form of authorized access to reach the exploit point.\n\nThus, with a final review for clarity and adherence to CVSS guidelines:\n\n- **AV**: N\n- **AC**: L\n- **PR**: L (considering the need for authorized access to the system before exploiting the vulnerability)\n- **UI**: N\n- **S**: U\n- **C**: H\n- **I**: H (given the potential for data modification through SQL injection)\n- **A**: N\n\nAnswer: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "prediction": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "answer": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "score": 0.7000000000000011, "success": true}
